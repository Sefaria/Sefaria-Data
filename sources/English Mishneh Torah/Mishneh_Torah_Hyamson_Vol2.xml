<p>&#x201C;How I love Thy Law: It is my meditation all the day&#x201D; (Psalms 119:97).</p>
<h1>BOOK II</h1>
<p>This is the Book of Love wherein are treated six [Scriptural] precepts in the following order:</p>
<p align="blockquote">the laws concerning the Reading of the <italic>Shema;</italic></p>
<p align="blockquote">the laws concerning Prayer and the Priestly Benediction;</p>
<p align="blockquote">the laws concerning Phylacteries, the scroll affixed to the doorpost and the Pentateuchal Scroll;</p>
<p align="blockquote">the laws concerning Fringes;</p>
<p align="blockquote">the laws concerning Blessings;</p>
<p align="blockquote">the laws concerning Circumcision.</p>
<ol>
<li>L<small>AWS</small> concerning the R<small>EADING</small> of the S<small>HEMA</small>.
<p>This is one affirmative precept:&#x2014;<br/>to read the Shema twice daily.</p></li>
<li>L<small>AWS</small> concerning P<small>RAYER</small>, and the P<small>RIESTLY</small> B<small>ENEDICTION</small>.
<p>These are two affirmative precepts:&#x2014;first, to serve God by daily prayer; second, that the Priests shall bless Israel daily.</p></li>
<li>L<small>AWS</small> concerning P<small>HYLACTERIES</small>, the scroll affixed to the door-post, and the Pentateuchal Scroll. These comprise five affirmative precepts detailed as follows:
<p>1) that the phylacteries should be upon the head;</p>
<p>2) that the phylacteries should be on the arm;</p>
<p>3) to affix a scroll to the door-posts and gates [of a town];</p>
<p>4) that every one shall write a Scroll of the Torah (Pentateuch) for himself;</p>
<p>5) that the King shal write a second Scroll, so that he should have two Scrolls of the Torah.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1>LAWS of FRINGES</h1>
<p>This is one affirmative precept:&#x2014;that one should affix fringes to corners of his garment.</p>
<h1>LAWS concerning BLESSINGS</h1>
<p>This is one affirmative precept:&#x2014;to bless the name of the Holy One, blessed be He, after a meal.</p>
<h1>LAWS concerning CIRCUMCISION</h1>
<p>This is one affirmative precept, namely, to circumcise a male infant on the eighth day after his birth.</p>
<p>Hence, the precepts treated in this book are eleven affirmative precepts.</p>
<h1>LAWS concerning READING of the SHEMA</h1>
<p>This is one affirmative precept, which is, to read the <small>SHEMA</small> twice daily. The exposition of this precept will be found in the following chapters.</p>
</chapter>
<chapter>
<title>Laws of Reading the Shema</title>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>1. The <italic>Shema</italic> is read twice every day,&#x2014;in the evening and in the morning, as it is said, &#x201C;and when thou liest down and when thou risest up&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:7), the phrases in this text meaning at the time when men are lying down, that is, at night, and at the time when they have risen, that is, by day.</p>
<p>2. What does one read? Three sections as follows: the section beginning, &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9); that commencing, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21); and that commencing, &#x201C;And the Lord spoke&#x201D; (Numbers 15:37-41). The section beginning, &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x201D; is recited first, because it sets forth the duties of acknowledging the Unity of God, loving Him, and studying His words. This is the great and essential matter on which all depends. Then, the passage beginning, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass&#x201D; is read, this containing a charge to fulfill all the other commandments. Finally the section concerning Fringes is read, as it also contains a charge to remember all the commandments.</p>
<p>3. Although the precept to wear fringes is not incumbent at night, still the section concerning this precept is recited at night, because it mentions the departure from Egypt, which it is a duty to recall by day and at night, as it is said, &#x201C;that thou mayest remember the day of thy going forth from the land of Egypt all the days of thy life&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 16:3). The reading of these three sections in this order is termed &#x201C;The reading of the <italic>Shema</italic>.&#x201D;</p>
<p>4. When reciting the <italic>Shema,</italic> after concluding the first verse, one repeats in a low tone the sentence, &#x201C;Blessed be the name of His glorious sovereignty for ever and ever&#x201D; and then resumes the reading of the first section in the regular order from the verse, &#x201C;And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God,&#x2026;&#x201D;to the end of the section. Why is the sentence above mentioned interpolated? We have a tradition that when the patriarch Jacob, residing in Egypt, gathered his sons about him, in his dying hour, he earnestly charged them concerning the Unity of God and the Way of the Lord in which Abraham and his father Isaac had walked. He questioned them, saying to them, &#x201C;Possibly, my sons, there is some one among you who is unworthy, and is not at one with me on the doctrine of the Unity of the Creator of the World,&#x201D; in the same way as our teacher Moses charged the people in the words, &#x201C;Lest there be among you a man or a woman &#x2026; whose heart turneth away this day&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 29:17). They all answered, &#x201C;Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.&#x201D; This means, &#x201C;Our father, Israel, hear this, our [confession of faith]: &#x2018;the Lord our God is one Lord&#x2019;&#x201D;. The aged patriarch then ejaculated, &#x201C;Blessed be the name of His glorious Sovereignty for ever and ever.&#x201D; Hence, all Israelites keep the custom of reciting, after the first verse of the <italic>Shema,</italic> the thanksgiving uttered by the Patriarch Israel.</p>
<p>5. Blessings are recited before the <italic>Shema</italic> and after it. When reading the <italic>Shema</italic> by day, two blessings are recited before it, and one after it. When reading it at night, two blessings are recited before, and two after it.</p>
<p>6. The former of the two blessings recited before the <italic>Shema</italic> by day, is that beginning, &#x201C;Who formest light and createst darkness.&#x201D; The latter is that beginning, &#x201C;With everlasting love hast Thou loved us.&#x201D; The blessing subsequent to the <italic>Shema</italic> is that beginning, &#x201C;True and Firm.&#x201D; The former of the two blessings recited <italic>before</italic> the <italic>Shema</italic> at night is that beginning, &#x201C;Who bringest on the evening twilight.&#x201D; The latter begins &#x201C;With everlasting love hast Thou loved Thy people Israel.&#x201D; The former of the blessings, recited <italic>after</italic> it, is that beginning, &#x201C;True and trustworthy.&#x201D; The latter, that beginning, &#x201C;Cause us to lie down [O Lord, our God, in peace.&#x201D;]</p>
<p>7. The first of the blessings recited before the Shema, whether by day or at night, is introduced with the formula, &#x201C;Blessed [art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe]&#x201D; and concludes with the formula, &#x201C;Blessed [art Thou, O Lord].&#x201D; Of the other blessings, each concludes with the formula, &#x201C;Blessed [art Thou, O Lord]&#x201D; but are not introduced with the formula, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou &#x2026;&#x201D; These blessings as well as all the other blessings with which all Israel are familiar were instituted by Ezra and his court and no one is permitted to take aught away from the wording or add to it. The blessings which they (Ezra and his colleagues) ordained to conclude with the formula, &#x201C;Blessed [art Thou etc.]&#x201D; may not be recited without this formula. Those which they ordained should conclude without this formula may not be recited with it. Those which they ordained not to begin with a benedictory formula, may not be begun with it. Those which they ordained should begin with it may not be begun without it. In short, whoever alters the form the Sages gave to the blessings commits an error and must recite the blessing again according to its prescribed form. Whoever does not recite the blessing beginning, &#x201C;True and firm&#x201D; in the morning, and that beginning, &#x201C;True and trustworthy&#x201D; in the evening has not fulfilled his duty.</p>
<p>8. If one has recited the second blessing before the first, either in the Morning or in the Evening Service, and whether the blessings thus transposed are those recited before or after the <italic>Shema,</italic> he has fulfilled his duty; for no order has been statutorily fixed for the blessings. If, in the morning service, one began the first blessing with the formula, &#x201C;Who createst light&#x201D; and concluded it with the formula, &#x201C;Who bringest on the evening twilight,&#x201D; he has not fulfilled his duty. But if one began with the formula, &#x201C;who bringest on the evening twilight&#x201D; and concluded with the formula, &#x201C;who createst light&#x201D; he has fulfilled his duty. Thus too, in the evening service, if one began with the formula, &#x201C;who bringest on the evening twilight&#x201D; and concluded with the formula, &#x201C;who createst light&#x201D; he has not fulfilled his duty; but if one began with the formula, &#x201C;who createst light&#x201D; and concluded with the formula, &#x201C;who bringest on the evening twilight&#x201D; he has fulfilled his duty; for the essential element in all Blessings is the Conclusion.</p>
<p>9. When is the time for reading the <italic>Shema</italic>? In the evening, the duty is correctly performed if it is read at any time from the first appearance of the stars till midnight. If one however transgressed and delayed, but read the Shema before daybreak, he has discharged the obligation. The Sages fixed midnight as the limit only in order to prevent complete violation.</p>
<p>10. One who reads the Evening Shema after dawn but before sunrise has not discharged his obligation, unless he had been unavoidably prevented from reading it earlier, as, for instance, if he had been inebriated or sick, etc. Anyone who unavoidably delays reading the <italic>Shema</italic> till this time does not recite the Blessing beginning, &#x201C;Cause us to lie down in peace.&#x201D;</p>
<p>11. When is the right time for reading the <italic>Shema</italic> by day? To observe the precept properly, one should begin reading it before sunrise, so as to conclude the recital of the Blessing after the Shema exactly at sunrise. This interval is about a tenth of an hour before the Sun rises. One who deferred reading the Shema till the Sun had risen, has discharged his obligation&#x2014;the period for reading the Shema being extended, for one who delayed, to the end of the first three hours of the day.</p>
<p>12. If one anticipated the hour and read the Shema of the Morning Service after dawn, he has fulfilled his duty, even if he concluded it before sunrise. In case of urgency, as for instance, when one has risen early in order to set out on a journey, he may deliberately read it before dawn.</p>
<p>13. If one reads the <italic>Shema</italic> after the first three hours of the day are gone, even though he had been unavoidably prevented from doing so earlier, he has not fulfilled the duty of reading the Shema at the right time. He is in the same category with one who reads the <italic>Torah.</italic> Still he recites the blessings that precede and follow it, at any part of the day, even if he delayed the reading till after the first three hours of the morning had elapsed.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. One who reads the <italic>Shema</italic> and does not concentrate his mind while reciting the first verse&#x2014;&#x201C;Hear, O Israel, the Lord, our God, the Lord is One,&#x201D; has not fulfilled his duty. As to the remaining verses, if he did not concentrate his mind (while reciting them), he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty. Even if he was reading the Torah in his usual course of study or examining these sections in a scroll (to ensure correctness), and read them at the prescribed time, he has fulfilled his duty, provided however that he concentrated his mind while reciting the First Verse.</p>
<p>2. Everyone may read the <italic>Shema</italic> in the ordinary postures&#x2014;standing, walking, lying down or riding on an animal. It is forbidden to read the Shema, lying down prone with face to the ground, or lying on the back with face looking up. But one may read it while lying on one&#x2019;s side. An extremely corpulent person who is unable to turn on his side or one who is sick should slightly turn on his side and then recite the <italic>Shema.</italic></p>
<p>3. A traveller, journeying on foot, must stand while reciting the first verse. The remaining verses he may read walking. A person who is asleep should be aroused when the time comes for reading the Shema, and kept awake till he has read the first verse. If after that, he is overcome by drowsiness and falls asleep, he is not to be disturbed.</p>
<p>4. A person, engaged in work at the time, pauses till he has read the whole of the first section. So also, artizans intermit their tasks while reciting the first section, so that their reading of the Shema shall not be perfunctory. The rest of the <italic>Shema,</italic> everyone reads, continuing his task in the meanwhile. Even if one is standing on the top of a tree or on a wall, he reads the <italic>Shema</italic> in that place, reciting there also the preceding and succeeding blessings.</p>
<p>5. If one was engaged in the study of the Torah and the time has come to read the <italic>Shema,</italic> he intermits his study, reads the <italic>Shema</italic> and recites the blessings before and after it. If one was engaged in public duties, he should not stop but complete them, and then read the <italic>Shema</italic> if there is still time to do so.</p>
<p>6. If one was eating, bathing, trimming his hair, turning hides in a tannery or hearing a trial in court, he finishes the matter in hand and then recites the <italic>Shema.</italic> If, fearing that the time for reading the <italic>Shema</italic> might pass, he interrupted the work on which he was engaged and read the <italic>Shema,</italic> he is accounted praiseworthy.</p>
<p>7. If one who had gone to take a ritual bath has time to come up from the bath and dress before the sun rises, he should do so and recite the <italic>Shema.</italic> If he feared that the sun would have risen before he was ready, he should immerse his body in the water in which he is standing and read the <italic>Shema.</italic> He must not do so in water so foul that it has a bad odor, nor in water that has been used for soaking flax nor in water that is so clear that the lower part of his body would be visible. But he may immerse his body in turbid water that has no offensive odor and read the <italic>Shema</italic> in the place where he stands.</p>
<p>8. While reading the <italic>Shema,</italic> one must not wink with the eyes, signal with the lips, or point with the fingers, so that his recital shall not be perfunctory. If he did any of these things, he has, though fulfilling his duty, been guilty of unbecoming conduct. A person should read the <italic>Shema</italic> so that the words are audible to himself. If he has not done so, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty. He should enunciate the letters distinctly. If he has not done so, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty.</p>
<p>9. How should care be exercised in enunciation?</p>
<p>One should take heed not to sound a letter with a strong <italic>Dagesh</italic> as if it were without such a <italic>Dagesh,</italic> nor a letter without a strong Dagesh as though it had such a Dagesh; nor sound a letter with a <italic>Sheva mobile</italic> as if it were immobile, nor, vice versa, sound a letter with a <italic>Sheva immobile</italic> as if it were mobile. Hence also, a pause should be made between two words, where the first of the two words ends with the letter with which the one immediately following it begins. For example, in reading the words <italic>Bechol levavcha,</italic> a pause should be made after the word <italic>Bechol,</italic> before reading <italic>levavcha.</italic> The same practice should be observed in the case of <italic>Va-avadtem meherah</italic> and <italic>Hacanaf pesil;</italic> so too the <italic>zain</italic> in <italic>tizkeru</italic> should be pronounced distinctly. One should dwell on the <italic>Daleth</italic> in <italic>Ehad</italic> a sufficiently long interval to enable one to acclaim God as Sovereign in Heaven and on Earth and towards the four cardinal points of the compass. The <italic>Heth</italic> in <italic>Ehad</italic> should not be pronounced hurriedly, for then the word would sound <italic>Ee had</italic><xref rid="fn1">&#x002A;</xref>.</p>
<p>10. A person may recite the <italic>Shema</italic> in any language that he understands. And if one reads the <italic>Shema</italic> in a secular language, he must take care to avoid errors in that language, and be as scrupulous in correctly enunciating the Shema in that language as he would be if he were reading it in the Sacred Tongue.</p>
<p>11. One who reads the <italic>Shema,</italic> but not in the correct sequence has not fulfilled his duty. This only refers to the recital of the verses out of their correct order. But if one reads a later section before the one that should have preceded it, though this is not permissible, still, in my opinion, he has fulfilled his duty, on the ground that these sections do not immediately follow each other in the Torah. To recite a verse and then reiterate it is unseemly. But if one reads a word and then repeats it, for instance, if one reads <italic>Shema, Shema,</italic> he is silenced.</p>
<p>12. One who reads the <italic>Shema</italic> but not continuously, has done his duty, even if he paused between the reading of one section and the next so long that he might have concluded the whole of it, provided that he reads the verses in the right order. If one reads the <italic>Shema</italic> when one is drowsy, not fully awake nor yet fast asleep, he has fulfilled his duty, provided that he is awake while reading the first verse.</p>
<p>13. If a person is in doubt whether he has read the <italic>Shema</italic> or not, he should read it again and recite the blessings that precede and follow it. But if one is certain that he read the <italic>Shema</italic> and is in doubt only whether he recited the blessings that precede and follow it, he should not read the blessings. If, while reading the <italic>Shema,</italic> he made a mistake, he should go back to the place where he had made the mistake. If between one section and another, he forgot and did not know which section he had completed and which he had to begin, he should go back to the first section, namely to the verse, &#x201C;Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God.&#x201D;</p>
<p>14. If one made a mistake in the middle of a section and does not know where he paused, he should return to the beginning of the section. If one recited the word <italic>U-chesavtom</italic> (&#x201C;And thou shalt write them&#x201D;) and is uncertain as to whether it is the word in the first, or in the second section, he is to return to this word in the first section. But if the doubt arises after he had already read the phrase <italic>Lemaan Yirbu Yemechem</italic> (&#x201C;That your days may be multiplied&#x201D;) he is not to go back, as it may be assumed that he has read regularly in the way his tongue is accustomed to do.</p>
<p>15. A person, while reading the <italic>Shema,</italic> met other people or was accosted by them. If at that moment, he had already concluded one section and not yet begun the next, he pauses and salutes anyone whom it is his duty to show honour to, e.g. a father, teacher, or superior in learning. And he returns the greeting of anyone who first saluted him.</p>
<p>16. If he was, at the time, in the middle of a section, he only pauses to salute one of whom he stands in awe, e.g. a king or a tyrannical individual, etc. And if one entitled to honour, e.g. a father or teacher, greets him first, he pauses to return the greeting.</p>
<p>17. The divisions between the sections are as follows: Between the first blessing and the second; between the second blessing and the <italic>Shema;</italic> between the first section and second section of the <italic>Shema;</italic> between the second and third section of the <italic>Shema.</italic> One reading the <italic>Shema,</italic> when reaching these places, greets one whom it is his duty to honour, and acknowledges the greeting of anyone who first salutes him. But the conclusion of the third section and the opening words of the subsequent blessing are regarded as the middle of a section. One may only pause there either to salute a person of whom one stands in awe or to return the greetings of a person whom it is one&#x2019;s duty to honour.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. Before reading the <italic>Shema,</italic> the reader washes his hands in water. If the time for reading has arrived, and he does not find water for the preliminary washing, he is not to delay the reading in order to search for water; but he is to wipe his hands with earth, or on anything solid, on a beam or similar object, and then he reads.</p>
<p>2. The <italic>Shema</italic> is not to be read in a bath house nor in a latrine, even if there is no ordure in it, nor in a graveyard, nor in proximity to a corpse. One is permitted to read it after moving away from the grave of a corpse to a distance of at least four cubits. If the <italic>Shema</italic> was read in a place where it was improper to do so, it must be read a second time.</p>
<p>3. Where a latrine has been newly erected but not yet used, the <italic>Shema</italic> may be read facing it, but not within it. In a new bath house, the <italic>Shema</italic> may be read. Where one of two buildings was set apart as a latrine, and the owner said of the second building, &#x201C;And this&#x201D;, it is doubtful whether the latter has also been appropriated to the same use as the former, or not. Hence one may not deliberately read the <italic>Shema</italic> there, but whoever has done so has fulfilled his duty. If the owner uttered the phrase, &#x201C;This too&#x201D;, both buildings are deemed to have been set apart as latrines, and the <italic>Shema</italic> may not be read in either. It is permitted to read the <italic>Shema</italic> in the courtyard of a bath house, i.e. in the place where people stand about, clothed.</p>
<p>4. Not only the sections of the <italic>Shema,</italic> but anything that appertains to things sacred may not be uttered in a bath house or latrine, even in a secular language. It is forbidden to speak there of such topics. Even to meditate silently on the words of the Torah in a latrine, in a bath house, or in any unclean place that contains ordure or urine, is also prohibited.</p>
<p>5. Secular matters may be discussed in a latrine, even in the Sacred (Hebrew) language. Thus also, the terms used to express the Divine Attributes, such as &#x201C;Merciful&#x201D;, &#x201C;Gracious&#x201D;, &#x201C;Faithful&#x201D;, etc., may be uttered in a latrine. But the Proper Names of the Deity&#x2014;which may not be erased&#x2014;must not be uttered in a latrine or in a bath house that had been used. If, however, there is occasion in a bath house or latrine, to restrain one from what is forbidden, this should be done, even if the Sacred Tongue has to be used and the matter appertains to things sacred.</p>
<p>6. It is forbidden to read the <italic>Shema</italic> where one is facing ordures of human beings, dogs or swine, even if hides are immersed in them (for tanning), or any other filth that emits an odor as foul as these. This reading is also forbidden where one is facing human urine. But where there is urine of a beast, the <italic>Shema</italic> may be read in front of it. When an infant is so young that it could not consume a quantity of cereal equal in volume to an olive, in the time that it would take an adult to eat a quantity of cereal equal in volume to three eggs, there is no need to move away from its stools or urine (in order to read the <italic>Shema</italic>).</p>
<p>7. If the ordure is as dry as earthenware, the <italic>Shema</italic> may not be read before it. If it is drier than earthenware, so that it crumbles when flung away, it is regarded as dust, and the <italic>Shema</italic> may be read before it. When urine, which the ground soaked up, still wets the hand touching the spot, the <italic>Shema</italic> may not be read before it. Where this condition no longer obtains, the <italic>Shema</italic> may be read there.</p>
<p>8. How far must one remove from ordure or urine, to be permitted to read the <italic>Shema?</italic> Four cubits. This applies to the case where these are behind him or beside him. But if they are in front of him, he must move away so far that he no longer sees them, and then he reads the <italic>Shema.</italic></p>
<p>9. This rule applies when he is in a room and on the same level with these. But if there was a place ten hand-breadths higher or lower than the level of their situation, he can stay there and read the <italic>Shema,</italic> there being an intervening space between him and the excreta&#x2014;provided however that no foul odor reaches him. So too, if he covered the ordure or urine with a vessel, they are regarded, though still in the room, as buried, and the <italic>Shema</italic> may be read notwithstanding their being there.</p>
<p>10. If one is separated from ordure by a glass partition even if the ordure is still visible through the glass, the <italic>Shema</italic> may be read near it. When a quarter of a log of water (&#x003D; the volume of a hen&#x2019;s egg and a half) has been poured into a vessel containing urine of one micturition, the <italic>Shema</italic> may be recited within four cubits of it.</p>
<p>11. If ordure is in a hollow in the ground, one may stand with his sandal covering the hollow and read the <italic>Shema,</italic> provided that the sandal is not in contact with the ordure. If it is exceedingly minute, a mere drop, he expectorates thick saliva upon it till it is covered and reads the <italic>Shema</italic>&#x2026;. Many Geonim have decided that it is forbidden to read the <italic>Shema</italic> if the hands are unclean and it is right to follow this ruling.</p>
<p>12. Where a foul odor emanates from any substance, one must move away [from it] to a distance of four cubits, and then one may read the <italic>Shema,</italic> if the odor has ceased. If it is still perceptible, one must move to a further distance where it is no longer perceptible&#x2026;. The <italic>Shema</italic> may not be read in front of a cesspool or before a chamberpot, even though these are empty and emit no odor, they being regarded as a latrine.</p>
<p>13. When filth is moving, e.g. if it is floating on the water&#x2019;s surface, it is forbidden to read the <italic>Shema,</italic> opposite it. A swine&#x2019;s mouth is regarded as moving filth; it is forbidden to read the <italic>Shema</italic> opposite it, till the swine has passed on beyond the reader&#x2019;s presence to a distance of four cubits.</p>
<p>14. If one, while walking, is reading the <italic>Shema</italic> and reaches a place where there is filth, he should not place his hand over his mouth and continue to read, but he must pause till he has passed the place.</p>
<p>15. If, when about to read the <italic>Shema</italic> in a room, a doubt arises in one&#x2019;s mind as to whether or not there is ordure or urine in it, he may read. If he is standing on a dust heap and he is in doubt as to whether there is ordure there, he is not to read till he has made an investigation, the presumption in the case of a dust heap being that it is a place where there is filth. If the doubt is as to whether there is urine there, he may read.</p>
<p>16. Just as the <italic>Shema</italic> may not be read in a place where there is ordure or urine till he has moved away [to a distance of at least four cubits], so it is forbidden to read the <italic>Shema</italic> in the presence of any person, even a gentile or child, whose privy parts are exposed, even though a glass partition separates him from them, unless he turns away his face. Since he is able to see, he may not read the <italic>Shema,</italic> unless he turns away his face. Any part of a woman&#x2019;s body falls under the same rule. Hence, while reading the <italic>Shema,</italic> one must not gaze at a woman&#x2019;s body, even if she is his wife. And if a hand-breadth of a part of her body [which is usually covered] is exposed, he must not read the <italic>Shema</italic> while facing it.</p>
<p>17. And just as one is forbidden to read the <italic>Shema</italic> in the presence of any one, the lower part of whose body is exposed, so it is forbidden for anyone to read it, who is himself in the same condition. One must accordingly not read it when nude, till he covers his nakedness. If his loins are covered with a girdle of cloth, skin or sacking, he may read the <italic>Shema,</italic> even though the rest of the body is uncovered, provided that (when sitting cross-legged) his heel does not touch his privy parts. If he is lying under a coverlid, and is otherwise without clothing, he should draw the coverlid closely below his heart, and then read the <italic>Shema.</italic> But he should not draw it about his neck and read it, for in that case there would be nothing separating his heart from the lower part of his body, and he would be in the same class with one who recites the <italic>Shema</italic> without wearing a girdle.</p>
<p>18. When two persons are lying under one coverlid, neither of them may read the <italic>Shema,</italic> even if he draws the coverlid closely beneath his heart, unless the coverlid is so arranged as to separate them, so that their bodies, from the loins downward, do not touch. When a man is sleeping with his wife, young children or other young members of his household, their bodies are like his, and he is not affected by contact with them. Hence, even if his body touches theirs, he turns away his face, draws the cover closely beneath his heart and then reads the <italic>Shema.</italic></p>
<p>19. Up to what age are they, in this respect, regarded as young children? A boy, in this respect, till the age of twelve years and a day; a girl, till she is eleven years and a day old. And then only if they have the marks of puberty&#x2014;breasts developed and hair on the body. In that case, he may not read the <italic>Shema</italic> unless they are separated by clothing. But if they are not physically so developed, he may read the <italic>Shema,</italic> even though their flesh touches his, and there is no need of separation till the male child has attained the age of thirteen years and a day, and the female child is twelve years and a day old.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. Women, slaves and children are exempt from the duty of reading the <italic>Shema.</italic> Children are taught to read it at the proper time; and they recite at the same time the blessings preceding and following it, so that they may be trained in the performance of religious duties. One whose mind is preoccupied and in an agitated state because of any religious duty which he has to perform is freed from the obligation of reading the <italic>Shema.</italic> Hence, a bridegroom who has wedded a virgin is exempted from reading the <italic>Shema</italic> till he has consummated the marriage&#x2026;. If however consummation has been deferred till the night after the Sabbath subsequent to the marriage, it is his duty to read the <italic>Shema</italic> from that night and onwards, as his mind has become calm and he is already familiar with his bride.</p>
<p>2. But if one marries a woman who was not at the time a virgin, it is his duty to read the <italic>Shema,</italic> there being no specific circumstance that would distract his mind. The same principle applies to similar cases.</p>
<p>3. He who has been bereaved of a relative for whom he has to keep the period of mourning is exempted from reading the <italic>Shema</italic> till he has buried the body, as his mind is not free for reading it. A watcher, even if the body is not that of a relative, is exempt from reading the <italic>Shema.</italic> When there are two watchers, one watches while the other withdraws to another room and reads it. Then he returns and watches while his companion withdraws and reads it. So too, one who is engaged in digging a grave for the interment of a human body is exempt, for the time being, from reading the <italic>Shema.</italic></p>
<p>4. The body is not to be removed for burial, close to the time when the <italic>Shema</italic> has to be read, unless the deceased was a great man. If the funeral procession had started, and the time for reading the <italic>Shema</italic> arrived while the bier is being followed, those needed for [carrying] it, such as the bearers and those who relieve them as well as those by whom these in turn are relieved, are exempt from reading the <italic>Shema,</italic> whether they are in front of the bier or behind it. Others who follow the bier but are not needed to carry it are obliged to read the <italic>Shema.</italic></p>
<p>5. When the people are engaged in listening to funeral addresses and the time arrives to read the <italic>Shema,</italic> they withdraw singly, to read the <italic>Shema,</italic> and return to listen to the funeral addresses that are delivered in the presence of the dead. But if the dead body is not in the place where they are gathered, all those present read the <italic>Shema</italic>&#x2014;the mourner however is silent as he is under no obligation to read the <italic>Shema</italic> till he has buried his dead.</p>
<p>6. After the interment, when the mourners have returned from the grave to receive condolences, and the people follow them from the grave to the spot where the mourners stand, to form a line to receive condolences&#x2014;if there is time for the people to commence and conclude the recital of at least one verse of the <italic>Shema</italic> before they reach the line, they should do so. Otherwise they are not to begin but should first offer their condolences to the mourners, and, after they have left them, read the <italic>Shema.</italic> Those who are in the interior lines and face the mourners are exempt from the duty of reading the <italic>Shema;</italic> but those who stand in the exterior lines, since they do not see the mourners, have the duty of reading the <italic>Shema</italic> where they are standing.</p>
<p>7. If one, exempt from reading the <italic>Shema,</italic> nevertheless desires to fulfill his duty strictly, and read it, he may do so, provided that his mind is free. But if such an exempted individual is in an excited state, he may not read it, till his mind is composed.</p>
<p>8. All who are ritually unclean are bound nevertheless to read the <italic>Shema</italic>; and, while still unclean, they recite the blessings that precede and succeed it, even if it is possible for them to get rid of their uncleanness, on the same day; as is the case with those who have touched a creeping thing, or touched a woman in the period of menstruation, or touched one who has a running issue, or the couch on which anyone of these has lain, etc. Ezra and his colleagues ordained that only one who had had an emission&#x2014;as an exception to all unclean classes&#x2014;may not read the words of the Torah till he has ritually bathed. This ordinance was not adopted universally. The majority of the community were unable to observe it, and it fell into desuetude. All Israelites have accordingly had the custom to read the Torah and recite the <italic>Shema,</italic> notwithstanding that they had had emissions. For the words of the Torah are insusceptible of defilement, but remain always pure, as it is said, &#x201C;Is it not thus, my words are like fire, saith the Lord&#x201D; (Jeremiah 23:29). Even as fire is incapable of being defiled, so the words of the Torah are insusceptible of defilement, but keep their purity forever.</p>
<p>Blessed be the All-merciful, Who hath aided us.</p>

<chapter>
<title>LAWS OF PRAYER AND OF THE PRIESTLY BLESSING.</title>
<p>These comprise two affirmative duties: first, to serve the Lord daily in prayer; secondly, that the priests should bless Israel daily. These two precepts are expounded in the following chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>
<p>1. To pray daily is an affirmative duty, as it is said, &#x201C;And ye shall serve the Lord, your God&#x201D; (Exodus 23:25). The service, here referred to, according to the teaching of tradition, is Prayer, as it is said, &#x201C;And to serve Him with all your heart&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 11:13), on which the sages commented, &#x201C;What may be described as Service of the Heart? Prayer&#x201D;. The number of prayers is not prescribed in the Torah. No form of prayer is prescribed in the Torah. Nor does the Torah prescribe a fixed time for Prayer. Hence, women and slaves are under an obligation to pray, this being a duty, the fulfillment of which is independent of set periods.</p>
<p>2. The obligation in this precept is that every person should daily, according to his ability, offer up supplication and prayer; first uttering praises of God, then, with humble supplication and petition ask for all that he needs, and finally offer praise and thanksgiving to the Eternal for the benefits already bestowed upon him in rich measure.</p>
<p>3. One who was fluent, would offer up many prayers and supplications. If one was slow of speech, he would pray as he could and whenever he pleased. Thus also, the number of separate services depended on an individual&#x2019;s ability. One would pray once daily; others, several times in the day. All, however, turned during prayer to the Sanctuary, in whichever direction that might be. This was the uniform practice from the times of Moses to those of Ezra.</p>
<p>4. When the people of Israel went into exile in the days of the wicked Nebucednezzar, they mingled with the Persians, Greeks and other nations. In those foreign countries, children were born to them, whose language was confused. Everyone&#x2019;s speech was a mixture of many tongues. No one was able, when he spoke, to express his thoughts adequately in any one language, otherwise than incoherently, as it is said, &#x201C;And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod and they could not speak in the Jews&#x2019; language, but according to the language of each people&#x201D; (Nehemiah 13:24).</p>
<p>5. Consequently, when anyone of them prayed in Hebrew, he was unable adequately to express his needs or recount the praises of God, without mixing Hebrew with other languages. When Ezra and his Council realized this condition, they ordained the Eighteen Benedictions in their present order.</p>
<p>6. The first three blessings consist of praises of God and the last three, of thanksgiving to Him. The intermediate benedictions are petitions for the things which may stand as categories of all the desires of the individual and the needs of the community. The object aimed at was that these prayers should be in an orderly form in everyone&#x2019;s mouth, that all should learn them, and thus the prayer of those who were not expert in speech would be as perfect as that of those who had command of a chaste style. For the same reason, they arranged [in a fixed form] all the blessings and prayers for all Jews so that the substance of every blessing should be familiar and current in the mouth of one who is not expert in speech.</p>
<p>7. Thus, too, they ordained that the Services of Prayer should be equal in number to the Sacrifices&#x2014;two services of prayer daily, corresponding to the two daily offerings. And for the day on which an additional offering was ordained, they instituted a third prayer, corresponding to the additional offering. The Service which corresponds to the daily morning sacrifice is called the Morning Prayer. The Service which corresponds to the Afternoon Sacrifice is called the Afternoon Prayer, and the Service corresponding to the Additional offering is called the Additional Prayer.</p>
<p>8. So also they ordained that a person should recite one service of Prayer at night, since the portions of the animal offered up as the Afternoon Sacrifice were consumed on the altar throughout the night, as it is said, &#x201C;This is the law of the burnt offering; this it is that which goeth up on its firewood upon the altar all night&#x201D; (Leviticus 6:2). And in this sense it is said, &#x201C;Evening and morning and at noon will I meditate and cry aloud, and He hath heard my voice&#x201D; (Psalms 55:18). The Evening Service is not obligatory like the Morning and Afternoon Services. Nevertheless all Israelites, wherever they have settled, have adopted the practice of reciting the Evening Service and have accepted it as obligatory.</p>
<p>9. So, too, they instituted a service to be recited after the afternoon service, close to sunset, but only on a fast day, the purpose being to add petitions and supplication on account of the fast. This Service is called &#x201C;the Closing&#x201D; [service]&#x2014;an allusion to the fact that the sky is closed to the sun which is at that hour of the day invisible&#x2014;this service being recited near sunset.</p>
<p>10. Thus the Services recited daily are three; namely, the Evening Service, the Morning Service and the Afternoon Service. On Sabbaths, Festivals and New Moons, they are four&#x2014;the three daily services and the Additional Service. On the Day of Atonement, they are five services, the four just mentioned and the <italic>Neilah,</italic> the closing service.</p>
<p>11. The number of these services may not be diminished but may be increased. If a person wishes to pray the whole day, he may do so. And the prayers he adds are accounted to him as if he brought free-will offerings. He must accordingly add in each of the middle blessings a thought appropriate to the particular blessing. If this is done in one of the blessings only, that is sufficient, the object being to make it manifest that the prayer is voluntary and not obligatory. In the first three and last three blessings there must be no addition, diminution or change.</p>
<p>12. A congregation does not hold a voluntary service, because the community never brought a free-will offering. Additional services (those recited on Sabbaths, Festivals and New Moons), may not be recited twice [even by a private individual], once by way of discharging an obligatory duty and once voluntarily, because the additional sacrifices were never brought as free-will offerings. One of the Geonim decided that it is forbidden to recite any voluntary service on Sabbaths and Festivals, since on those days no free-will offerings were brought but only those that were obligatory.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. In Rabban Gamliel&#x2019;s days, the number of heretics in Israel increased. They were wont to vex the Israelites and seduce them to turn away from God. When R. Gamliel realized that the most urgent need was to remove this evil, he composed a Benediction which contains a petition to God to destroy the heretics, and incorporated it in the Eighteen Blessings so that it should be in a fixed form for all. Hence the total number of Blessings in the Daily Service is Nineteen.</p>
<p>2. In each of the three daily services, a person recites these nineteen blessings in their appointed order. But only if he finds that his mind is in a fit state for prayer and he is fluent in speech.<xref rid="fn2">&#x002A;</xref> But if one is distracted and harassed, or is not fluent in speech, he should recite the first three blessings, a blessing embodying the gist of all the intermediate blessings, and the last three blessings, and then he has fulfilled his duty.</p>
<p>3. The Blessing that they ordained as a summary of the intermediate blessings is as follows: Give us understanding, O Lord, our God, to know Thy ways, and circumcise our hearts to fear Thee. Be forgiving unto us, so that we may be redeemed. Keep us far from sorrow. Make us prosperous. Cause us to dwell in the pastures of Thy land. Gather the scattered from the four [corners of the earth]. Let them that go astray in the knowledge of Thee be judged;<xref rid="fn3">&#x002A;</xref> and over the wicked wave Thy hand. Let the righteous rejoice in the rebuilding of Thy city and in the reestablishment of Thy temple, and in the flourishing of the horn of David, Thy servant, and in the rekindling of the light of Jesse&#x2019;s son, Thine anointed. Before we call, do Thou answer; before we speak, do Thou hearken; as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass, before they call, I will answer; while they are still speaking, I will hear&#x201D; (Isaiah 65:24); for Thou art He who answereth in all times of trouble, who delivereth and rescueth from all distress, Blessed art Thou O Lord who hearkenest unto prayer.</p>
<p>4. The foregoing rule only applies to the summer season. But in the winter the summary of the intermediate blessings is not recited; because, in the blessing for a prosperous year, the petition for dew and rain has to be recited. So also, this summary is not recited in the Evening Prayer at the close of Sabbath or Festival, because in the Blessing for Granting Understanding, the paragraph relating to the distinction between sacred and profane has to be added.</p>
<p>5. On Sabbaths and Festivals, seven blessings are recited in each of the four Services for the day; namely, the usual first three blessings, and last three blessings, and an intermediate blessing appropriate to the particular day. On Sabbaths, the intermediate blessing concludes with the formula, &#x201C;Who hallowest the Sabbath.&#x201D; On the Festivals it concludes, &#x201C;Who hallowest Israel and the Seasons.&#x201D; And on a Sabbath which is at the same time a festival, the concluding formula is, &#x201C;Who hallowest the Sabbath, Israel and the Seasons.&#x201D; On New Year, the conclusion is, &#x201C;King over all the earth, who hallowest Israel and the Day of Memorial.&#x201D; When the New Year falls on a Sabbath, the concluding formula is, &#x201C;King over all the earth, who hallowest the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Memorial.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6. The foregoing statement applies to the evening, morning and afternoon services of the New Year. But the additional service on the New Year consists of nine blessings; the first three and the last three recited daily, and three Intermediate. Of these intermediate benedictions, the theme of the first is God&#x2019;s Sovereignty; of the second His remembrance; while the third has references to the Shofar. Each of these blessings concludes with a formula appropriate to its theme.</p>
<p>7. On the Day of Atonement, in each of the five services, seven blessings are recited, the first three, the last three, and an intermediate blessing, appropriate to the day, which concludes, &#x201C;King over the whole earth, who sanctifiest Israel and the Day of Atonement.&#x201D; If that day happens to fall on a Sabbath, the intermediate blessing in each service concludes, &#x201C;King over the whole earth, who sanctifiest the Sabbath, Israel and the Day of Atonement.&#x201D;</p>
<p>8. The foregoing statement applies to the Fast of the Day of Atonement in ordinary years but on that fast-day in the Jubilee year, nine blessings are recited in the additional service as in the additional service of the New Year. The same blessings are recited, neither more nor less, and are only recited when the law of the Jubilee is in force.</p>
<p>9. Before reciting the first blessing in each of the services, one begins, &#x201C;O Lord, open Thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise,&#x201D; (Psalms 51:7) and after concluding the service, one adds, &#x201C;Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer,&#x201D; (Psalms 19:15), after which the worshipper steps backward.</p>
<p>10. On New Moons and on the intermediate days of the festivals, the nineteen blessings are recited for the evening, morning and afternoon services, as on ordinary days; and the prayer beginning, &#x201C;O our God and God of our fathers, may our remembrance rise, come, etc.&#x201D; is incorporated in the blessing referring to the restoration of the ancient service. The additional service on the intermediate days of the festivals is the same as on the feast itself. On New Moons, one recites for the additional service, the first three and the last three blessings (common to all services) and an intermediate blessing having reference to the additional sacrifice prescribed for the New Moons, and concludes it with the formula, &#x201C;Who sanctifiest Israel and the new moons.&#x201D;</p>
<p>11. On a Sabbath that is also an intermediate day of a festival, and likewise when the beginning of the month falls on a Sabbath, the evening, morning and afternoon services consist of the seven blessings, as on other Sabbaths&#x2014;with the prayer, &#x201C;O, our God and God of our fathers, let our remembrance arise and come, etc.&#x201D; added in the blessing referring to the restoration of the ancient service. In the additional service, the intermediate blessing begins and ends with a reference to the Sabbath while the middle portion refers to the special sacred character of the day. On new moons it concludes, &#x201C;Who sanctifiest the sabbath, Israel and the beginning of the months,&#x201D; and on the intermediate days of the festivals, the conclusion is the same as on a festival that falls on the sabbath. When a festival falls on the first day of the week, the following paragraph is inserted, in the evening service, in the fourth blessing:</p>
<p>12. &#x201C;Thou hast made known unto us the judgments of Thy righteousness, and hast taught us to perform the statutes of Thy will. Thou hast given us, O Lord our God, the holiness of the Sabbath and the glory of the appointed time, and the celebration of the festival. Thou hast made a distinction between the holiness of the Sabbath and that of the feast, and hast hallowed the great and holy seventh day. Thou hast given us, O Lord our God, appointed times for gladness and seasons for joy,&#x2026;&#x201D; At the close of the Sabbath or festivals throughout the year, the <italic>Habdalah</italic> (paragraph referring to the distinction between the profane and holy), is recited in the fourth blessing, &#x201C;Thou favourest man with knowledge &#x2026;&#x201D;, although the <italic>Habdalah</italic> is afterwards also said over the cup of wine.</p>
<p>13. During the Feast of Lights and on the Feast of Lots, the paragraph beginning, &#x201C;For the miracles&#x201D; is added in the blessing beginning, &#x201C;We give thanks unto Thee.&#x201D; On the Sabbath during the Feast of Lights the paragraph, &#x201C;For the miracles&#x201D; is recited in the Additional Services as it is in the other services.</p>
<p>14. On fast days, every one who fasts adds, in the blessing concluding, &#x201C;Who hearkenest unto prayer,&#x201D; the paragraph beginning, &#x201C;Answer us etc.&#x201D; The reader of the congregation, when repeating the service aloud, recites this paragraph as an independent blessing, between the blessing relating to redemption and that relating to health; and concludes it with the formula, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who answerest in time of trouble.&#x201D; And so on that day the reader recites twenty blessings. On the ninth of Ab, a paragraph is added in the blessing concluding, &#x201C;Who rebuildest Jerusalem,&#x201D; as follows: Have mercy, O Lord our God, upon us and upon Israel, Thy people, and upon the city that is ruined and desolate &#x2026;&#x201D;</p>
<p>15. During the winter, the phrase, &#x201C;Who causeth the rain to fall,&#x201D; is inserted in the Second blessing, while in summer the phrase, &#x201C;Who causeth the dew to descend&#x201D; is recited. The formula, &#x201C;Who causeth the rain to fall&#x201D; is first said in the Additional service of the last (eighth) day of the feast of Tabernacles and continues to be said till the morning service on the first day of Passover. And the formula, &#x201C;Who causeth the dew to fall&#x201D; is begun in the additional service of the first day of Passover.</p>
<p>16. Beginning with the seventh day of Marheshvan, a petition for Rain is included in the blessing calling for prosperity during the year, and is recited as long as the reference to rain, inserted in the second blessing, continues to be said. This is the rule for the Holy Land. But in Shinar (now called Iraq), Syria, Egypt, and adjacent territories, as well as in other places similar to these (in climate) the petition for Rain is begun sixty days after the autumnal equinox.</p>
<p>17. In places that require rain in the summer, for instance in the distant sea-girt islands, a petition for rain, is offered up, whenever it is needed, in the prayer ending, &#x201C;Who hearkenest unto prayer.&#x201D; In places where the second days of the feasts are kept, the formula, &#x201C;Who causest the rain to descend&#x201D; is recited, for the first time in the year, in the additional Service, on the first day of the feast of Solemn Assembly (8th day of Tabernacles) and continues to be recited throughout the winter.</p>
<p>18. The third blessing ends, throughout the year, with the words, &#x201C;the holy God,&#x201D; and the eleventh blessing, with the words, &#x201C;King who loveth righteousness and justice.&#x201D; But in the ten days, from the New Year to the close of the day of Atonement, the third blessing ends with the words, &#x201C;the holy King&#x201D; and the eleventh, with the words, &#x201C;The King of Justice.&#x201D;</p>
<p>19. In some places it is customary, during these ten days, to add in the first blessing the petition, &#x201C;Remember us unto life, &#x2026;&#x201D;, in the second blessing, the sentence, &#x201C;Who is like unto Thee, O merciful father &#x2026;&#x201D;, (in the Thanksgiving blessing, &#x201C;Remember Thy mercies &#x2026;&#x201D;)<xref rid="fn4">&#x002A;</xref> and in the last blessing, &#x201C;In the book of life &#x2026;&#x201D; So too, in some places they have the custom, during these ten days, to add in the third blessing the paragraphs, &#x201C;And thus cause the fear of Thee, O Lord our God &#x2026;&#x201D; On the New Year and the Day of Atonement, the addition of these paragraphs to the third blessing is the general practice.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. In order that the duty may be properly fulfilled, the morning service should begin at sunrise. It may however be recited till the close of the fourth hour after dawn, that is, till the lapse of one third of the day. And if one transgressed, wittingly or in error, and recited the Service after the fourth hour, and before noon, he has fulfilled the duty of reciting the prayer, but not that of reciting it at the right time. For even as prayer is a precept of the Torah, so it is an ordinance of our teachers to offer it at the proper time, as appointed by the sages and prophets.</p>
<p>2. We have already stated that the time for reciting the afternoon service was fixed to correspond with the hour when the daily afternoon sacrifice was offered up. As this took place daily nine and a half hours after dawn, the time for reading the afternoon service was appointed to begin nine and a half hours after dawn. This is termed the Minor Afternoon (Service). And since the daily [afternoon] sacrifice was slaughtered six and a half hours after dawn on the Eve of Passover, whenever that date fell on the eve of the Sabbath, the Sages declared that if one recites the afternoon service later than six and a half hours after dawn, he has fulfilled his duty. The arrival of this hour marks the time when the obligation to read the afternoon service has commenced. This is termed the Major Afternoon (Service).</p>
<p>3. Many have the custom of reciting both the major and minor afternoon services, one of them as an optional service. Some of the Geonim<xref rid="fn5">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> decided that only the major afternoon service may be thus recited. And this is in accordance with reason; for it corresponds to the fact that the offering of the daily afternoon Sacrifice at that hour did not take place regularly, every day.<xref rid="fn6">&#x002A;</xref> Still, if the major afternoon service had been recited as the obligatory service, the minor afternoon service should only be recited as an optional service.</p>
<p>4. Hence, the time for reciting the major afternoon service begins six and a half hours (after dawn) and continues till nine and a half hours (after that time), while the time for the minor afternoon service begins from nine and a half hours and continues till one and a quarter hours before the close of day. The prayer should however be recited before sunset.</p>
<p>5. The time for reciting the additional service begins after the morning service and continues till the seventh hour of the day. One who recites it after the seventh hour, although he has transgressed (the rule as to the hour), has nevertheless fulfilled his duty, since the time for reciting it is the whole day.</p>
<p>6. The time for the evening service, though it is not obligatory, is, for the one who reads it, from the commencement of nightfall till dawn. The <italic>Neilah</italic><xref rid="fn7">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> should be read at a time to allow it to be completed near sunset.</p>
<p>7. One who recites a service, before the time appointed, has not fulfilled his duty and has to recite it again at the right time. But, if a person, on an urgent occasion, has recited the morning service after dawn (but before sunrise) he has fulfilled his duty. The evening service for the Sabbath Eve should be recited on the Eve of the Sabbath, before sunset. So the evening service for the close of the sabbath may be recited on the sabbath; the reason being that as the evening service is optional, one need not be strict as to the time of its recital; provided that the <italic>Shema</italic> is read at the proper time after the stars are visible.</p>
<p>8. If the proper time of a service has passed without its having been recited, the omission, if wilful, cannot be rectified or made good. But if the omission was due to error or preoccupation, it can be made good at the next service. The latter is first recited at its proper time, and the prayer is then repeated to make good the omission.</p>
<p>9. For example: If by mistake, one omitted to read the prayer in the morning and the first half of the day passed, he should read the prayer in the afternoon twice; first to fulfill the duty of reading the afternoon service, and a second time, to make good the omission of the morning service. If through error, the afternoon service had been omitted and the sun had set, the prayer in the evening should be read twice; the first time, as the evening service, and again, to make up for the omission of the afternoon service. If, by error, the evening service has not been read, and it has dawned, the morning prayer should be read twice, the first time, as the morning service, the second, to make up for the omission of the previous evening service.</p>
<p>10. If two successive services had erroneously been omitted, only the latter can be made good. For example, if, by error, one recited neither the morning nor the afternoon services, he is to read the evening prayer twice; the first time as the evening service, the second to make up for the omission of the afternoon service. But the omission of the morning service cannot be made good, the time for that having passed. The same applies to other services.</p>
<p>11. If one has two services to read, that of the afternoon and the additional service, the afternoon service should be read first and then the additional service. One authority decides that this should not be done in congregational worship, lest the people be misled (as to the normal order of the Services).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. There are five requisites, the absence of which hinder the [proper] recital of a Service, even when its due time has arrived;&#x2014;Cleansing the hands, Covering the body, Assurance as to the cleanliness of the place where the prayers are recited, Removal of distractions, and Concentration of the mind.</p>
<p>2. Cleanliness of hands: How is this condition complied with? The hands are washed in water, up to the wrists, and then the prayers are recited. A person, travelling on the road, finds, when the time for prayer has arrived, that he has no water. If it can be procured within a distance of four miles, equal to 8000 cubits, he should proceed to the locality where there is water, wash his hands and then recite the prayers. If the distance exceeds that limit, he wipes his hands on a clod, or with loose earth, or on a beam and then reads the Service.</p>
<p>3. This rule only applies if the direction of the place where water can be procured is in front of the traveller. But if it is in his rear, he is only obliged to retrace his steps a mile. If he has passed on from the place where there is water beyond this distance, he is not obliged to go back, but wipes his hands and recites the prayers. The statement that for prayers only the hands need to be cleansed refers to all services except the morning service. For this service, the face, the hands and the feet<xref rid="fn8">&#x002A;</xref> should first be washed, and then the prayers are recited. If water is not accessible, one wipes the hands only, and recites the prayers.</p>
<p>4. Those who are ritually unclean wash their hands only&#x2014;like those that are clean&#x2014;and recite the prayers. Although they are able to take a ritual bath and so be rid of their ritual impurity, their omission to do so does not debar them from the recital of the prayers. We have already explained that Ezra instituted the rule that one who had had an emission should not read Torah alone till he had taken a ritual bath. Subsequent authorities extended the rule to the recital of prayers, and ordained that such a person should not recite the prayers alone till he had ritually bathed. This rule has no connection with ritual cleanliness or uncleanliness. Its purpose is to restrain scholars from uxoriousness. Hence the limitation of the requirement of ritual bathing to those who had seminal emissions and whose case forms an exception to those otherwise unclean.</p>
<p>5. While this ordinance was in force it was held that even one who suffered from flux and had a seminal issue, or a woman who in her period of menstration had a seminal discharge, or during cohabitation, found that her period of separation had come, must, in order to read the <italic>Shema</italic> and the prayers, first take a ritual bath on account of the seminal emission, even though they are also otherwise unclean. This is logical, the ritual bathing being prescribed not because of the uncleanness, but to discourage uxoriousness. The ordinance, however, has become obsolete, as it was never universally adopted by the Jewish people and was found too irksome.</p>
<p>6. The custom is general in Spain and in Shinar (Iraq) that one who has had a seminal emission does not recite prayers till he has washed all his body in water, out of respect to the exhortation, &#x201C;Prepare to meet thy God.&#x201D; This only applies to a healthy person or one who is sick and has cohabited. But a sick man who has had an involuntary emission is exempt from the duty of bathing for prayer. The custom does not apply to his case, nor to the case of one who suffers from a flux or of a woman in her period of separation who had a seminal emission. They dry themselves, wash their hands and recite the prayers.</p>
<p>7. The covering of the body: how is this requirement to be fulfilled? Although the lower part of the body is covered, as for the reading of the <italic>Shema,</italic> the prayers are not to be recited till the heart is also covered. If one has not covered it or is unable to do so, having nothing wherewith to cover it, and recites the prayers, he has fulfilled his duty, since the lower part of his body is covered. But he should not do so deliberately.</p>
<p>8. Cleanliness of the place where prayers are recited: how is this condition fulfilled? One may not pray in a place where there is filth, nor in a bath-house, nor in a latrine, nor on a site used for depositing refuse, nor in any place concerning which there is no presumption that it is clean. In short, wherever the <italic>Shema</italic> is not read, there prayers are not recited. And as we move away from ordure, urine, a foul odor, a corpse, and an indecent exposure, in order that we may read the <italic>Shema,</italic> we do the same, for the recital of the prayers.</p>
<p>9. A person who, after reciting prayers, finds ordure in the place, inasmuch as he had committed a sin in not examining it before his recital of the prayers, must read them again in a clean place. A person, while standing and reading the service, finds ordure in front of him. If by walking on, he would leave it four cubits in his rear, he should do so. If this is impossible,<xref rid="fn9">&#x002A;</xref> he should move away from it sideways. If he cannot do this, he must intermit the recital of the prayers. The great sages did not recite prayers in a house where there was beer or strong sauce that had turned bad, because of its offensive odor, even though the premises might otherwise be clean.</p>
<p>10. [Absence of] disturbing elements. How is this requisite fulfilled? If one feels an urgent call of nature, one must not pray. If the call is disregarded, the prayer that one utters is an abomination. And, having first relieved himself, he should recite the Service a second time. But if he can restrain himself as long as it would take to walk a <italic>Parsah</italic> (&#x003D; 4 mil &#x003D; 8000 cubits), his recital of prayer is accounted a proper recital. Nevertheless, prayers should not be recited by anyone till he has examined himself well and is satisfied that the calls of nature have been attended to. So also, phlegm, saliva and anything else that might disturb one should be removed and then the prayers should be recited.</p>
<p>11. A person who, during prayers, stretches himself, yawns or sneezes, if he does so voluntarily, his behavior is unseemly. But if, before beginning his prayers, he examined himself and the act was involuntary, it does not matter. Saliva that has accumulated during prayer, should be covered with the garment. A person, whose delicacy would be offended by this procedure, casts it behind him with his hand, so that during prayer he may be saved from an annoyance which would disturb him. If, while standing in prayer, intestinal flatus involuntarily escapes, he waits till it has passed and resumes his prayer.</p>
<p>12. If he is seized with intestinal flatulence, and its retention causes him excessive pain, he should step backwards four cubits and wait till he feels relieved. Then he should say: &#x201C;Lord of the Universe, Thou hast formed us with apertures and cavities. Our shame and reproach are open and known to Thee. Objects of shame and reproach are we while we live; worm and corruption, after we die.&#x201D; Then he returns to his place and resumes his prayer.</p>
<p>13. If, while standing reading the service, his urine dripped on to his knees, he should pause till the dripping has ceased, and then resume his prayers at the place where he left off. If he had paused for an interval sufficiently lengthy to conclude the service, he starts again from the beginning.</p>
<p>14. So, after urinating, one must pause for as long as it would take to walk four cubits and then one may recite the service. Thus too, after the conclusion of a service, one should wait as long as it would take to walk four cubits before urinating, so that there shall be an interval after the reading of the service.</p>
<p>15. Concentration of the mind&#x2014;how is this condition [to be fulfilled?] Any prayer uttered without mental concentration is not prayer. If a service has been recited without such concentration, it must be recited again devoutly. A person finds that his thoughts are confused and his mind is distracted: He may not pray till he has recovered his mental composure. Hence, on returning from a journey or if one is weary or distressed, it is forbidden to pray till his mind is composed. The sages said that he should wait three days till he is rested and his mind is calm, and then he recites the prayers.</p>
<p>16. What is to be understood by concentration of the mind? The mind should be freed from all extraneous thoughts and the one who prays should realize that he is standing before the Divine Presence. He should therefore sit awhile before beginning his prayers, so as to concentrate his mind, and then pray in gentle tones, beseechingly, and not regard the service as a burden which he is carrying and which he will cast off and proceed on his way. He should, accordingly, also sit awhile, after concluding the prayers, and then leave. The ancient saints were wont to pause and meditate one hour before the service, one hour after the service and take one hour in its recital.</p>
<p>17. An intoxicated person must not pray, because he cannot concentrate. If he prays, his prayer is an abomination. He must therefore recite the prayers again after he has recovered from his intoxication. A person under the influence of drink should not pray while in that condition. But if he has recited the service, it is regarded as prayer. A drunkard is one who is unable to speak in the royal presence. A person under the influence of drink is one who can speak in the presence of a king without committing error. Yet having drunk, if only a quarter of a <italic>log</italic> of wine,<xref rid="fn10">&#x002A;</xref> one is not to pray till he is rid of the effect of the wine he has taken.</p>
<p>18. So too, persons should not stand up to pray after indulging in jest, laughter, frivolity, idle talk, quarrelling or outburst of anger, but only after the study of Torah, not however of legal discussions by which the mind is distracted, but only after the study of such themes as require no profound reflection, as for instance established rules.</p>
<p>19. Prayers which are only read at periodic intervals, such as the additional service for the beginning of the month and the services for the festivals should be first rehearsed before one stands up to recite them so that he shall not break down during their recital.</p>
<p>20. If a person were travelling in a dangerous locality, infested, for example, by wild beasts or robbers, he should recite one blessing as follows: &#x201C;The needs of Israel, Thy people, are many. Their knowledge is scanty. Be it Thy will, O Lord, our God, to give every one what is sufficient for his maintenance and provide every creature with its requirements. Do what is good in Thy sight. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hearkenest unto prayer.&#x201D; He recites this prayer, walking. If he is able to stand on one spot while uttering it, he should do so. And when he arrives in a neighbourhood that is populated and his mind is calm, he reads the service of nineteen blessings in its regular form.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>
<p>1. In reciting prayers, eight points should be heeded and observed. If, however, these were disregarded, owing to stress, or disability or even wilfully, the recital of the prayers would not be debarred [deemed ineffective]. The points are as follows: one should stand; with face towards the Temple; the body should be in correct posture; the clothing adjusted; one should stand in a proper place; the voice should be properly modulated; and genuflection and prostration be correctly performed.</p>
<p>2. <italic>The Standing position.</italic> The <italic>Amidah</italic> [main prayer] is only recited, standing. A person who is on a ship or in a waggon should, if he is able, stand up for that prayer. If unable, he may read it, sitting in his place. A sick person may read it, even lying down on his side, provided, however, that he can concentrate his mind. A thirsty or hungry person is in the same category as the sick: if he can concentrate, he recites the prayer; if not, he should not do so till he has refreshed himself with food and drink. A person who is riding, need not alight, even if there is some one to hold his beast so that his mind may be at ease.</p>
<p>3. <italic>With face turned towards the Temple.</italic> Anyone outside Palestine turns his face towards the land of Israel and recites the prayer. One who is in the Holy Land turns towards Jerusalem. One who is in Jerusalem turns towards the Temple. If one is in the Temple, he turns towards the Holy of Holies. A person who is either blind, or unable to determine the right direction, or is on a ship, directs his heart to the Divine Presence and prays.</p>
<p>4. <italic>Correct posture.</italic> When standing in prayer, the feet should be in line; the eyes lowered as if one were looking towards the ground; while the heart should be uplifted as if one were in heaven; the hands should be placed over the heart, close together, the right over the left. The worshipper should stand, like a servant in his master&#x2019;s presence, in awe, fear and dread. He should not place his hands on his hips.</p>
<p>5. <italic>Adjustment of the dress.</italic> Before beginning the Service, the dress should first be adjusted and the personal appearance made trim and neat, as it is said, &#x201C;O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness&#x201D; (Psalms 96:9). One should not stand in prayer wearing a moneybelt, nor bareheaded, nor barefoot, where the local custom is not to stand in the presence of the great, without shoes. And one should not pray anywhere, holding phylacteries in the hand or carrying a scroll of the law in the arms, for the mind would then be preoccupied with those sacred objects. Nor while praying, should vessels or money be held in the hand. On the feast of Tabernacles, however, the worshiper prays, while carrying a palm branch&#x2014;this being the religious duty of the day. When the time comes to recite the prayer, a person carrying a burden on his head, adjusts it behind him, if it is less than four kabs<xref rid="fn11">&#x002A;</xref> and recites the prayer. If it is four kabs in size, he places it on the ground, and then prays. The practice of all the sages and their disciples is not to pray unless their heads are wrapped in the <italic>Talith</italic> (praying shawl).</p>
<p>6. <italic>Place where the worshiper prays.</italic> He should stand in a low place and turn his face to the wall. Windows or doors towards Jerusalem should be opened, and he should stand facing them when he prays, as it is said, &#x201C;Now his windows were open in his upper chamber towards Jerusalem&#x201D; (Daniel 6:11). There should be one fixed place set apart for prayer. It should not be recited in a ruin nor at the rear of a synagogue, unless the worshiper turns his face towards the synagogue. It is forbidden to remain seated at the side of one who is standing in prayer, or pass in front of him unless he has moved away from the worshiper to a distance of four cubits.</p>
<p>7. One must not, while praying, stand on a spot three hand-breadths or more above the floor of the room; nor may one stand for prayer upon a bed, stool or chair. A lofty structure, provided that it is four cubits by four cubits in area&#x2014;the size of a chamber&#x2014;is regarded as an attic, and it is permitted to pray in it. So, too, if it was enclosed on all sides by partitions, even though its area was less than four cubits by four cubits, prayers may be recited while standing in it, for the height of such a structure is not noticed, it being a compartment by itself.</p>
<p>8. Labourers who are working on the top of a wall, or on the top of a tree, when the time for prayer arrives, should descend to the ground, recite the prayer, and resume their labours. If they are on the top of an olive tree or a fig tree, they recite it where they are, as it would entail excessive trouble to descend. What prayer do they recite? Those who work for board only recite the three daily prayers, of nineteen blessings each. If they were working for wages, they recite <italic>Havinenu</italic> [Summary of the Middle Blessings, together with the first three and last three blessings]. In either case, no congregational service is held, nor is the priestly benediction pronounced.</p>
<p>9. <italic>Modulation of the voice.</italic> The voice should not be raised during the recital of the <italic>Amidah</italic> prayer nor should it be offered [silently] in thought alone. The words should be pronounced with the lips, but softly, and yet be audible to the speaker&#x2019;s ears. The worshiper should not permit his voice to be heard by others, unless he is sick, or is unable to concentrate his attention without reading aloud. He may not, however, do so at public worship, so that the congregants shall not be disturbed by his loud praying.</p>
<p>10. <italic>Genuflection.</italic> The worshiper bends the knees five times in every [<italic>Amidah</italic>] prayer,<xref rid="fn12">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> at the beginning and at the end of the first blessing; at the beginning and the end of the thanksgiving blessing (which begins &#x201C;We thank Thee&#x201D;); and after the conclusion of the prayer. The knees are then bent, the worshiper steps backwards three paces, and with knees bent, bows to the left, then to the right, and then raises his head.</p>
<p>When he bends the knees the first four times, he does so while uttering the word &#x201C;Blessed&#x201D; and resumes the erect posture at the word &#x201C;O Lord.&#x201D; This rule applies to the layman. The high priest however bends the knees at the beginning and end of every blessing. The king bows his head at the beginning of the [<italic>Amidah</italic>] prayer and does not raise it till he has concluded it.</p>
<p>11. Why does the worshiper bow towards the left, first? Because his left corresponds to the right of the person whom he faces. And just as one who stands before a king bows to the king&#x2019;s right and then to the king&#x2019;s left, so the sages ordained that at the conclusion of the <italic>Amidah</italic>, the same etiquette should be observed as in taking leave of the royal presence.</p>
<p>12. In all these genuflections, the worshiper should bow till all the vertebrae of the spinal column become prominent, and his body assumes the shape of a bow. If however he bowed slightly and made an effort which caused strain, so that it is evident that he bows as low as he can, he need not be apprehensive [as to whether he had fulfilled his duty].</p>
<p>13. <italic>Prostration.</italic> After he has raised his head, subsequent to the fifth genuflection, the worshiper seats himself on the floor and &#x201C;falls upon his face&#x201D; and offers all the supplications he pleases. Genuflection, wherever mentioned, always refers to bending the knees. <italic>Kidah</italic> means &#x201C;falling on the face&#x201D; [with knees bent]. <italic>Hishtahvayah</italic> means stretching out the hands and feet, so that one is lying prone with face to the ground.</p>
<p>14. When performing the rite of &#x201C;falling on the face&#x201D;, after the service, some fall on the face, some prostrate themselves. The latter is forbidden on a stone floor, except in the Temple of Jerusalem, as has been explained in the laws concerning Idolatry. [Even] a worthy person may not fall on his face unless he is conscious that he is a righteous man like Joshua.<xref rid="fn13">&#x002A;</xref> He should only incline his face somewhat, but not press it against the floor. It is permissible to recite the service of prayer in one spot and &#x201C;fall upon the face&#x201D; elsewhere.</p>
<p>15. It is a rule universally observed in Israel, that the rite of &#x201C;falling upon the face&#x201D; is not practised on Sabbaths, Festivals, the New Year, the New Moon, Feast of Lights, Feast of Lots, at the afternoon services on the eves of Sabbaths and Festivals, or in the evening service any day. Some individuals fall on their faces in the evening service. All do so in every service on the day of Atonement, this being a day of petition, supplication, and fasting.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI.</h1>
<p>1. A person is forbidden to pass at the rear of a Synagogue while public worship is proceeding, unless he is carrying a burden, or the Synagogue has two entrances on two sides, when an observer could say, &#x201C;Possibly, he will enter at the other door.&#x201D; So too, if there are two Synagogues in a city, an observer could say, &#x201C;Possibly the passer-by is proceeding to the place of worship he usually attends.&#x201D; If he has phylacteries on his head, he is permitted to pass by, even in the absence of these circumstances; for the phylacteries indicate that he is eager to perform religious duties and does not belong to those who neglect the duty of prayer.</p>
<p>2. One who recites his prayers with a congregation should not unduly protract its recital. But when one is alone, it is left to his discretion. If, after the <italic>Amidah</italic> prayer, he wishes to continue with supplications even to the length of the Confessional ritual for the day of Atonement, he may do so. Or if he desires to introduce in each of the intermediate blessings an addition appropriate to any of the blessings he may do so.</p>
<p>3. For instance: If there is a sick person about whom he is concerned, he interpolates in the blessing relating to the sick, in accordance with his ability, a petition for divine mercy to be vouchsafed to the patient. If he needs a livelihood, he interpolates a special supplication in the blessing praying for a prosperous year. In the same way, he may make additions in every one of the blessings. Or if he wishes to include petitions for all his needs in the blessing which ends with the phrase, &#x201C;Who hearkeneth unto prayer&#x201D;, he may do so. But no petition may be inserted in the first three or in the last three blessings.</p>
<p>4. It is forbidden to take any refreshment or do any work after daybreak, till the morning service has been recited. Nor should a visit be paid, early in the morning, to a neighbour&#x2019;s home, to greet him, before the morning service has been recited. Nor should one set out on a journey before praying. But refreshment may be taken before reciting the additional service or the afternoon service. A meal however must not be taken, close to the hour for reading the afternoon service.</p>
<p>5. When the major afternoon has arrived (half an hour after midday), one must not repair to the bathing establishment&#x2014;even only to perspire&#x2014;till he has first read the [afternoon] service, lest he faint and omit the prayer. Nor may one sit down even to a casual meal, lest he linger over it. Nor proceed to the trial of a case, even towards its conclusion, lest the pleas may be upset and the proceedings be prolonged and so the service of prayer be omitted. Nor may one sit down in a barber&#x2019;s shop to have the hair cut till he has recited the service, lest the scissors become broken (and delay would ensue). Nor should one enter a tannery near the afternoon, till he has first prayed, lest, seeing his property spoiling, he may busy himself therewith and be prevented reciting the service. If however he has begun any of the foregoing, he does not stop but concludes what he is engaged in, and then recites the afternoon service.</p>
<p>6. When is the cutting of the hair regarded as having begun? When the barber lays the barber&#x2019;s sheet upon the customer&#x2019;s knees. When is bathing regarded as having begun? When the bather removes the garment next to his skin. When is one regarded as having begun to tan? When he fastens over his shoulders the apron as the workmen do. When is a meal considered to have begun? In Palestine, when the hands have been washed; in Babylon, when the girdle has been loosened. When is a trial regarded as having begun? When the judges are robed, each of them in a Talith (Praying shawl) and have taken their seats. If they are already seated, when the litigants have opened their pleading.</p>
<p>7. Although the evening service is optional, a man, coming home from his work, should not say, &#x201C;I will eat a little and sleep a little and then recite the prayers&#x201D;, lest he be overcome by sleep and continue to sleep throughout the night. He should first read the evening service and then eat and drink or sleep.</p>
<p>It is permitted to have one&#x2019;s hair cut or go into a bathing establishment near the time for the morning service, as the prohibition only applies to the afternoon when it is a usual procedure for most people to enter bathing establishments or have their hair cut during the day. But in the early morning this is unusual and was not prohibited.</p>
<p>8. If one was occupied with the study of the Torah, he intermits his studies when the time for prayer arrives and recites the service. If study was his profession and he does no other work, he does not stop learning if he is engaged in it at the time of prayer; for the duty of studying Torah is more important than that of reciting prayer. One who occupies himself with the needs of the community is in the same class with one who is occupied with the study of the Torah.</p>
<p>9. A person who is praying must not break off his prayer, except only if he is in mortal danger. Even when a king who is an Israelite greets him, he must not return the greeting. But if the king is an idolater, he stops, lest the king puts him to death. If, while standing and praying, he sees a king who is an idolater or a man of violence coming towards him, he should shorten the prayer. If unable to do so, he should stop praying. So too, if he sees snakes and scorpions, whose sting in that locality is deadly, moving in his direction, he stops his prayers as soon as they get near him and escapes. But if their sting is not deadly, he does not intermit his prayers.</p>
<p>10. Women, slaves and children are under an obligation to recite the prayers. Every person exempt from reading the <italic>Shema</italic> is exempt from reciting the prayers. All those who follow a funeral, although they are not needed to carry the bier, are, for the time being, exempt from reading the prayers.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>
<p>1. When the sages instituted these services of prayer, they likewise instituted other blessings, to be recited daily. These are as follows: When about to retire to rest for the night, one recites the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, king of the Universe, who causest the bands of sleep to fall upon my eyes and givest light to the pupil of the eye. May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to deliver me from the evil inclination and from mishap. Let not evil dreams nor evil imaginations trouble me. May my rest be perfect before Thee. Cause me to rise from it to life and to peace, and lighten mine eyes lest I sleep the sleep of death. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who givest light to the whole world in Thy glory.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. He then reads the first section of the <italic>Shema</italic> and sleeps. If he is overcome by drowsiness, he reads even if it be only one verse [of the <italic>Shema</italic>] or verses of a supplicatory character and sleeps.</p>
<p>3. When he awakes, after he has completed his rest, he recites, while still on his couch, the following blessing: &#x201C;O my God, the soul that Thou gavest me is pure. Thou didst create it, Thou didst form it, Thou didst breathe it into me, Thou preservest it within me, Thou wilt take it from me and wilt restore it unto me hereafter. So long as the soul is joined within me, I give thanks unto Thee, O Lord my God, Sovereign of all works. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who restorest souls unto dead bodies.&#x201D;</p>
<p>4. When he hears the crowing of the cock, he recites the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe<xref rid="fn14">&#x002A;</xref>, who hast given to the cock intelligence to distinguish between day and night.&#x201D; When he puts on his garments, he recites, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who clothest the naked.&#x201D; When he puts on his headgear he recites, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who crownest Israel with glory.&#x201D; When he passes his hands over his eyes, he recites, &#x201C;Who openest the eyes of the blind.&#x201D; When he sits up on his couch, he recites, &#x201C;Who loosest those that are bound.&#x201D; When he descends from the couch and puts his feet on the ground, he recites, &#x201C;Who spreadest forth the earth above the waters&#x201D;. When he stands up, he recites, &#x201C;Who raisest up them that are bowed down&#x201D;. When he washes his hands, he recites, &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and given us a command concerning the washing of the hands&#x201D;. When he washes his face, he recites the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who removest the bands of sleep from mine eyes and slumber from mine eyelids. May it be Thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers to accustom me to religious duties and not accustom me to transgression. Let the good inclination have sway over me and let not the evil inclination have sway over me. Strengthen me in Thy commandments and grant my portion in Thy Law. Grant that I may be vouchsafed grace, loving kindness and mercy in Thy sight and in the sight of all who behold me, and bestow upon me loving kindnesses. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who bestowest loving kindnesses upon Thy people, Israel.</p>
<p>5. When one goes to the toilet, he says before entering, &#x201C;Honoured be ye, O honoured and holy ones, ministers of the Supreme. Protect me, protect me; tarry for me when I enter and till I leave; for this is the way of the children of men&#x201D;.<xref rid="fn15">&#x002A;</xref> After leaving, he recites the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast formed man in wisdom and created in him many orifices and vessels. If one of these should close<xref rid="fn16">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> or one of these open,<xref rid="fn16">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> it would be impossible to exist even for a single hour. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who healest all flesh and doest wondrously.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6. When he fastens his girdle, he recites, &#x201C;Who girdest Israel with strength&#x201D;. When he puts on his shoes, he recites, &#x201C;Who hast supplied my every want&#x201D;. When he starts to go out, he recites, &#x201C;Who hast made firm the steps of man&#x201D;. A male recites daily the following blessings, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast not made me a heathen&#x201D;; &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast not made me a bondman&#x201D;; &#x201C;Blessed art Thou O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast not made me a woman&#x201D;.<xref rid="fn17">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>7. These Eighteen blessings have no appointed order. Each blessing is recited at the appropriate time and occasion. For example: If one has put on his girdle, while still on his couch, he recites the blessing, &#x201C;Who girdeth Israel with strength&#x201D;. When he hears the cock crow, he recites the blessing, &#x201C;Who hast given the cock intelligence, etc.&#x201D;. Any of the above blessings for which there is no occasion, is not recited.</p>
<p>8. For example: If one passed the night without removing his clothes, on arising in the morning he does not recite the blessing, &#x201C;Who clothest the naked&#x201D;. If one walks barefoot, he does not recite the blessing, &#x201C;Who hast supplied my every want&#x201D;. On the Day of Atonement and on the Ninth of Ab, when there is no ablution, one does not recite the blessing, &#x201C;Concerning the washing of hands&#x201D;, nor the blessing, &#x201C;Who removest the bands of sleep from mine eyes&#x201D;.<xref rid="fn18">&#x2020;</xref> If one has no occasion to visit the toilet, he does not recite the blessing, &#x201C;Who formest man, etc.&#x201D;. And so with the other blessings.</p>
<p>9. The people in most of our cities have the custom of reciting these blessings in the Synagogue, consecutively, whether they were under an obligation to do so or not. This however is an erroneous practice which should not be followed. No blessing should be recited unless there is an obligation to do so.</p>
<p>10. If one rises early to read the Torah, before he has recited the <italic>Shema,</italic> whether it is the Written or the Oral Law that he intends to study, he first washes his hands, recites three blessings and then proceeds to his reading. The blessings are as follows: &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and given us a command concerning the words of the Law. Make pleasant, we beseech Thee, O Lord our God, the words of Thy Law in our mouth and in the mouth of Thy people, all the house of Israel, so that we with our offspring and the offspring of Thy people all the house of Israel may know Thy name and learn Thy Law for its own sake. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who givest the Law. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast chosen us from all nations and given us Thy Law. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who givest the Law.&#x201D;</p>
<p>11. It is a duty to recite these three blessings daily and then read a small portion of the words of the Torah. The people have the custom to read the Priestly Benediction.<xref rid="fn19">&#x002A;</xref> In some places the section referring to the Daily Sacrifices<xref rid="fn20">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> is read. In others again, both these sections are read. Chapters or paragraphs from the <italic>Mishna</italic> or the <italic>Boraitha</italic> are also read.</p>
<p>12. The early Sages lauded one who reads every day psalms from the Psalter, beginning with &#x201C;the Psalm of David&#x201D; (Psalm 145) and continuing till the end of the book. It is also settled practice to read verses before and after these Psalms. The Sages appointed a blessing to be recited before the psalms, the one beginning, &#x201C;Blessed be He who spake&#x201D;, and a blessing to be recited after them, beginning, &#x201C;Praised be Thy name.&#x201D; Then the blessings for the <italic>Shema</italic> are recited and the <italic>Shema</italic> is read.</p>
<p>13. In some places, it is the custom, after the blessing beginning, &#x201C;Praised by Thy name,&#x201D; to read daily &#x201C;The Song of the Red Sea&#x201D; (Exodus 15:1-18), and then the blessings before the <italic>Shema.</italic> In other places, the custom is to read <italic>Haazinu</italic> (Deuteronomy Chapter 32.) Some individuals read both Songs. In this regard, custom always rules.</p>
<p>14. A person is in duty bound to recite every complete day one hundred blessings. How are these hundred blessings made up? There are twenty-three blessing which we have enumerated in this chapter; and seven blessings before and after the morning and evening recital of the <italic>Shema.</italic> When putting on the <italic>Zizith</italic>,<xref rid="fn21">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> the blessing is recited, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to wear a fringed garment&#x201D;. When putting on the <italic>Tephillin</italic> (phylacteries), the blessing is recited, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to lay the <italic>Tephillin</italic>&#x201D;. All these, together with the three daily Services, each consisting of eighteen benedictions, make up eighty-six blessings. When two meals are taken each day, fourteen blessings are recited, seven at each meal, as follows; one blessing on washing the hands, one for the meal, three after its conclusion, one blessing before taking a drink and one after, making seven blessings for each meal.</p>
<p>15. At the present time, since the institution of the blessing concerning Heretics as a part of the <italic>Amidah</italic> Service, and the addition of the blessing beginning, &#x201C;Who is good and Who doest good&#x201D; to the Grace after meals, there are five additional blessings (beyond the hundred). On Sabbaths and Festivals when the Amidah service consists of seven blessings, and on other days if one was not under the obligation to recite all these benedictions, as, for instance, if one did not sleep the whole night, did not loosen his girdle, or did not need to visit the toilet, and so forth, he has to complete the hundred blessings by partaking of fruit.</p>
<p>16. How so? He partakes of a little vegetable, reciting the blessings before and after doing so; then a little of various kinds of fruit, reciting the appropriate blessings before and after each kind; and counts the blessings till the hundred, to be daily recited, are completed.</p>
<p>17. The order of the prayers is as follows. In the morning, on arising, a person recites the blessings mentioned above; then reads the Psalms&#x2014;reciting the appropriate blessings before and after them. Then he reads the <italic>Shema,</italic> reciting the blessings before and after it, omitting the <italic>Kedusha</italic><xref rid="fn22">&#x002A;</xref> from the former of the two blessings before the <italic>Shema,</italic> this not being recited by an individual in his private devotions. When he has concluded the blessing after the <italic>Shema,</italic> which closes with the phrase, &#x201C;Who redeemedst Isael&#x201D; he immediately rises, so that the reference to the Redemption may be connected with the <italic>Amidah prayer,</italic> which, as already stated by us, is recited standing. When this prayer is concluded, he sits down, bows his head, offers up supplications, raises his head and still seated, offers further supplications. Then he reads &#x201C;The Psalm of David&#x201D; (Psalm 145), offers according to his ability, more supplications, after which he proceeds to his affairs.</p>
<p>18. The afternoon service begins with the reading of &#x201C;The Psalm of David&#x201D; (Psalm 145), the worshiper being seated. He then rises and recites the <italic>Amidah</italic> for the afternoon service. This concluded, he bows his head, offers supplications, raises his head, and offers further supplications according to his ability, and then proceeds to his affairs.</p>
<p>19. In the evening service, the worshipper reads the <italic>Shema,</italic> reciting the appropriate blessings before and after it. The blessing referring to the redemption of Israel is connected with the <italic>Amidah,</italic> which is recited, standing. This concluded, the worshipper sits a brief while and withdraws. Whoever adds supplications after the <italic>Amidah</italic> in the evening acts commendably. Though the blessing concluded, &#x201C;Who redeemedst Israel&#x201D; is followed by the blessing beginning, &#x201C;Cause us to lie down&#x201D;, this is not regarded as an interruption between the blessing relating to redemption and the <italic>Amidah,</italic> both blessings being regarded as one lengthy blessing.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VIII.</h1>
<p>1. Congregational prayer is always heard [by the Almighty]. Even if there are sinners among them, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not reject the prayer of a multitude. Hence, a person should associate himself with the congregation, and never recite his prayers in private when he is able to pray with the congregation. One should always attend Synagogue, morning and evening; for only if recited in a synagogue, are one&#x2019;s prayers heard at all times. Whoever has a synagogue in his town and does not worship there is called a bad neighbour.</p>
<p>2. It is a <italic>Mitzvah</italic> (praiseworthy duty) to proceed to the Synagogue at a quick pace, as it is said, &#x201C;And let us know; let us be eager to know the Lord&#x201D; (Hosea 6:3). When leaving the Synagogue, a person should not take big strides, but walk at a slow pace. On entering the Synagogue, one should move forward the distance [of the width] of two doors, and then recite his prayers, so as to fulfill the text, &#x201C;Waiting at the posts of my doors&#x201D; (Proverbs 8:34).</p>
<p>3. A house of study is superior to a synagogue. Eminent sages, notwithstanding that there were many synagogues in their towns, only prayed in the places where they were engaged in the study of the Torah. It is understood that congregational services are [also] held there.</p>
<p>4. How is public worship conducted? One person recites the prayers aloud, and all the rest listen. This is not done, if there are less than ten adult men present, the Reader being counted in the number. Even if some of them have already said their prayers and thus discharged their obligation, they help to complete the quorum of ten, provided that the majority have not yet said their prayers. So too, the <italic>Kedushah</italic><xref rid="fn23">&#x002A;</xref> is not recited, nor is the Torah recited with the blessing before and after the reading, nor the lesson from the prophets read [with its blessings], unless a quorum of ten is present.</p>
<p>5. Thus too, one individual is not to recite the blessings before the <italic>Shema</italic> while all listen and respond Amen, unless a quorum of ten is present. This is termed <italic>Poress al Shema</italic> (Cp. Targum to I Samuel 9:13). Nor is <italic>Kaddish</italic> recited, unless ten are present. Nor do the priests solemnly raise their hands (to recite the priestly benediction) unless ten are present, the priests being counted in the number. For every group of ten in Israel is called a Congregation, as it is said, &#x201C;How long shall I bear with this evil congregation&#x201D; (Numbers 14:27). Those alluded to here were ten, (the Spies)&#x2014;Joshua and Caleb being excluded.</p>
<p>6. Every procedure of a sacred character should only take place in a congregation of Israelites, as it is said; &#x201C;And I will be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel&#x201D; (Leviticus 22:32). All the recitals, referred to above, if begun when a quorum of ten was present, of whom some left, though they are not authorized to do so, are concluded by those who remain.</p>
<p>7. It is requisite that the congregation be assembled in one place and that the reader be with them in that place. Where a small court opens, throughout its complete breadth, to a larger courtyard, and nine persons are in the larger, while one person is in the smaller enclosure, they form a quorum. But if nine persons are in the smaller enclosure and one person is in the larger, they do not constitute a quorum. If the congregation is in the larger enclosure and the Reader in the smaller, their obligation to worship is discharged when he officiates on their behalf. But if the congregation is in the smaller, and the Reader in the larger enclosure, their obligation is not discharged when the reader recites the service, since he is separated from them and not in the same place with them, for the larger enclosure having posts on both sides is regarded as divided off from the smaller enclosure. The smaller enclosure, however, is regarded not as divided off from the larger enclosure, but as a corner of it.</p>
<p>8. So too, if there is ordure in the larger enclosure, it is forbidden to recite prayers or read the <italic>Shema</italic> in the smaller enclosure. But if there was ordure in the smaller enclosure, prayers may be recited and the <italic>Shema</italic> may be read in the larger, provided that there was no offensive odor, since the smaller enclosure is divided off from the larger.</p>
<p>9. The Reader discharges the obligation of the Congregation. How so? When he recites the prayers and they respond with the utterance of Amen after every blessing, they are regarded as praying. This only aplies to one who does not know the liturgy. One who is proficient does not discharge his obligation unless he recites the prayers for himself.</p>
<p>10. The foregoing rule holds good for all days of the year except New Year&#x2019;s Day and the Day of Atonement in a Jubilee year. On those two days, the Reader discharges the obligations of the proficient as of the non-proficient, on the ground that the prayers recited on those days are lengthy and the majority of those acquainted with them cannot concentrate their minds as the Reader can. Hence, if one who is proficient wishes on those days to rely on the Reader&#x2019;s recital of the prayers, he may do so.</p>
<p>11. None should be appointed as Reader to the Congregation unless he is reputed for his knowledge and exemplary conduct. If he is an old man, all the better. An endeavor should be made to secure one who has a pleasant voice and is accustomed to read. Anyone whose beard is not full grown, even though he is a great scholar, should, out of respect to the Congregation, not be appointed as the regular reader. But one may publicly recite the blessings before the <italic>Shema,</italic> as soon as the marks of puberty appear and one has passed the age of thirteen years.</p>
<p>12. One whose enunciation is indistinct, who, for example, reads the <italic>Aleph</italic> as an <italic>Ayin</italic> or the <italic>Ayin</italic> as an <italic>Aleph,</italic> or cannot pronounce the letters correctly, is not to be appointed as Congregational reader. A teacher may appoint one of his pupils to read the services in his presence.</p>
<p>13. A blind man may publicly recite the blessings before the <italic>Shema</italic> and be appointed Reader to the Congregation. But one whose shoulders are bare, though he may publicly recite the blessings before the <italic>Shema,</italic> does not recite the <italic>Amidah</italic> as Reader of the Congregation unless he is properly clad.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IX.</h1>
<p>1. The order of congregational services is as follows: At the morning services, the congregants are seated. The reader proceeds to the reading desk, begins with the recital of the <italic>Kaddish.</italic> All the people respond aloud as follows: &#x201C;Amen; may His great Name be blessed for ever and to all eternity&#x201D;, and at the close of the <italic>Kaddish</italic> they again respond, &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;. Then he says, &#x201C;Bless ye the Lord who is blessed&#x201D;; they respond, &#x201C;Blessed be the Lord who is blessed for ever and ever&#x201D;. He then starts to recite the <italic>Shema</italic> with the blessings preceding and following it. They respond, &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; at the close of each blessing. Any one, who is able, recites the blessings and reads the <italic>Shema</italic> at the same time as the reader till he has concluded the blessing after the <italic>Shema,</italic> which ends with the words, &#x201C;Who redeemed Israel&#x201D;.</p>
<p>2. All the worshipers immediately rise and recite the <italic>Amidah</italic> in a low tone. Whoever does not know the prayer stands silent while the reader and the congregation are praying inaudibly. As soon as a congregant has concluded the <italic>Amidah,</italic> he steps back three paces and remains standing there.</p>
<p>3. After the reader has stepped back three paces he begins to recite the <italic>Amidah</italic> aloud from the beginning of the blessings; in order that anyone who has not recited the prayer shall be regarded as having discharged his obligation. All remain standing and listen and respond &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; after each blessing, those who have discharged their obligation by reciting the <italic>Amidah,</italic> as well as those who have not done so.</p>
<p>4. He recites <italic>Kedushah</italic> in the third blessing. When the reader comes to the <italic>Kedushah,</italic> every one of the congregants may return to the place where he had stood while reciting the <italic>Amidah.</italic> When the reader reaches the blessing beginning, &#x201C;We thank Thee&#x201D; and bends his knee, all the congregants bow slightly, not however to excess, and recite, &#x201C;We give thanks unto Thee, O Lord our God and God of all flesh, our Creator, the Creator of all things in the beginning. Blessings and Thanksgivings be to Thy great and holy Name, because Thou hast kept us in life and hast preserved us. So mayest Thou continue to keep us in life and be gracious unto us. Gather our exiles to Thy holy courts, to observe Thy statutes, serve Thee in truth and do Thy will with a perfect heart, seeing that we give thanks unto Thee&#x201D;. Any one who reiterates, &#x201C;We give thanks unto Thee; we give thanks unto Thee&#x201D; is silenced.</p>
<p>5. After he has completed reciting the whole <italic>Amidah,</italic> he seats himself, bows his head, inclines slightly sideways; all the congregants doing the same. In this attitude, he offers up supplications. He then sits up and raises his head, the rest of the people doing the same; and, while seated, offers supplications aloud.</p>
<p>6. The reader then rises alone and recites the <italic>Kaddish</italic> a second time, the Congregation making the responses as on the first occasion. He then recites, &#x201C;And He, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity, etc.,&#x201D; then, the Psalm of David&#x2014;(Psalm 145). The reader in the meanwhile stands; the congregation remains seated and recites with him. He then recites, &#x201C;And a redeemer shall come unto Zion, etc. And as for me, this is my covenant, etc. But Thou art holy, etc. And one cried unto another, Holy, etc.&#x201D; He completes the <italic>Kedushah.</italic> The congregants respond, &#x201C;Holy, holy, holy&#x201D; three times. He then reads the <italic>Kedushah</italic> in the Aramaic version. Then he recites the text, &#x201C;Then a wind lifted me up, etc.&#x201D; He reads this also again in the Aramaic version. Then he recites, &#x201C;The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.&#x201D; This he also repeats in Aramaic, so that the people may understand. These verses before and after the <italic>Kedushah</italic> together with their Aramaic versions are styled &#x201C;The order of Sanctification&#x201D;. The reader then prays in supplicatory terms, reads verses of a supplicatory tenor, and recites <italic>Kaddish</italic> to which the people make the customary responses, and then they depart.</p>
<p>7. Whoever says in his supplications, &#x201C;He that dealt mercifully with a nest of birds, forbidding the taking of the mother-bird together with the nestlings (Deuteronomy 22:6-7) and the slaughtering of a beast and its young in one day (Leviticus 22:28)&#x2014;may He have mercy upon us&#x201D;, or offers petitions of a similar character is silenced; for these precepts are divine decrees set forth in Scripture and have not been ordained in a spirit of compassion. Were this the motive, the slaughtering of all animals would have been prohibited. It is also forbidden to multiply epithets and say: &#x201C;O God, Great, Mighty, Awe-inspiring, Powerful, Puissant&#x201D;, since it is beyond human power to exhaust the praises of God. One should therefore limit himself to the attributes used by Moses, our teacher, Peace be upon him.</p>
<p>8. In the afternoon service, the Reader begins reading: &#x201C;And He, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity and destroyeth not; yea, many times He averteth His anger and awakeneth His wrath not at all&#x201D; (Psalm 38, verse 38),<xref rid="fn24">&#x002A;</xref> and &#x201C;Happy are they that dwell in Thy house etc. A Psalm of David etc.&#x201D; (Psalm 145). While reading this psalm, both he and the congregation are seated. The reader rises and says <italic>Kaddish.</italic> The congregants rise after him and make the customary responses. They all recite the <italic>Amidah</italic> inaudibly. The reader repeats the <italic>Amidah</italic> aloud, as in the morning service, till he has concluded the whole of it. All then bow their heads, offering supplications; raise their heads and continue their supplications remaining seated, as in the morning service. The reader then rises and recites <italic>Kaddish.</italic> The people make the customary responses. Then they depart to their affairs.</p>
<p>9. In the evening service, all the congregants are seated. The reader rises and recites, &#x201C;And He, being merciful etc.&#x201D;, &#x201C;Bless ye the Lord, who is to be blessed&#x201D;. They respond, &#x201C;Blessed is the Lord who is to be blessed for ever and ever&#x201D;. He then begins to read the <italic>Shema</italic> with its accompanying blessings and says <italic>Kaddish,</italic> after which all rise and silently repeat the Amidah. When they have concluded, the reader says <italic>Kaddish.</italic> The congregation then departs. The reader does not, in the Evening Service, repeat the Amidah aloud, because that Service is not obligatory. He accordingly abstains from a recital of blessings that would be nugatory, since there is no one under an obligation to recite them, or would require the reader to discharge the duty for him.</p>
<p>10. On the Eves of the Sabbaths, the Reader, after saying the <italic>Amidah</italic> silently with the Congregation, repeats it aloud. He does not however recite the Seven Blessings, but one blessing only, which summarizes the seven. The following is what he says:</p>
<p>11. &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, Possessor of Heaven and Earth. He with His word was a shield to our forefathers, and by His bidding, will quicken the dead; the holy God, like unto whom there is none; Who giveth rest to His people on His holy Sabbath day, because He took pleasure in them to grant them rest. Him we will serve in fear and with awe, and daily and constantly we will give thanks unto His name in the fitting form of blessings. He is the God to whom thanksgivings are due, the Lord of peace, Who halloweth the Sabbath and blesseth the Seventh Day, and in holiness giveth rest unto a people sated with delights, in remembrance of the Creation. Our God and God of our fathers, accept our rest etc. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath.&#x201D; He then says <italic>Kaddish,</italic> after which all the people depart.</p>
<p>12. The reason why the Sages instituted this particular repetition is because the majority of the people come on the Eves of Sabbaths to join in public worship, and there may be one present who came late and has not completed his prayer. He might be left alone in the synagogue and incur danger. The Reader therefore repeats a summary of the <italic>Amidah,</italic> so that all the congregation shall stay till the late comer shall have concluded and be able to leave with them.<xref rid="fn25">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>13. Hence, when a feast, the Day of Atonement or the First of the Month falls on a Sabbath, the reader who officiates does not include in this blessing any reference to the special day, but ends with the formula, &#x201C;Who hallowest the Sabbath,&#x201D; the reason being that the special day imposes no obligation to say this blessing.</p>
<p>14. On sabbaths and festivals, after the Reader has completed the repetition of the morning <italic>Amidah,</italic> he says <italic>Kaddish,</italic> reads the 145th Psalm and again says <italic>Kaddish,</italic> after which the Congregation reads the additional service softly which he then recites aloud, as he did the [Amidah in the] morning service. He then says <italic>Kaddish</italic> after the additional service; and the people depart. Neither the &#x201C;Order of Sanctification&#x201D;<xref rid="fn26">&#x002A;</xref> nor propitiatory prayers are then recited. They are recited before the afternoon service. Kaddish is then said. The <italic>Amidah</italic> for the afternoon is read by the Congregation and repeated aloud by the Reader who then says <italic>Kaddish.</italic></p>
<p>15. On the First Day of each month, and on the Intermediate Days of the Festivals, the &#x201C;Order of Sanctification&#x201D; is recited before the additional service. On the termination of the Sabbath, the Order of the Day (&#x003D; Order of Sanctification) is recited after the evening service. Kaddish is then said and <italic>Habdalah</italic> (the group of blessings for the distinction between the holy [day] and the secular [days] is recited at the termination of Sabbaths and Festivals).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER X.</h1>
<p>1. If one has recited the <italic>Amidah</italic> without devotion, he should recite it again devoutly. If he, however, concentrated his attention during the recital of the first blessing, he need not read the prayer again. If one committed an error in one of the first three blessings, he has to turn back to the beginning of the <italic>Amidah.</italic> If he made a mistake in one of the last three blessings, he turns back to the blessing relating to the restoration of the Temple Service. If he made a mistake in one of the intermediate blessings, he turns back to the beginning of the blessing in which he made the mistake, and then continues the Service in regular order to the end. The reader, if he makes a mistake when reading the <italic>Amidah</italic> aloud, follows the same rules.</p>
<p>2. But if the reader made a mistake while silently reading the <italic>Amidah,</italic> he does not, in my opinion, recite it silently a second time, so as not to incommode the congregation. He relies on his repetition of the <italic>Amidah</italic> which he will recite aloud. This is so if he had made no mistake in the first three blessings. If however the mistake was in one of these, he turns back to the beginning of the <italic>Amidah,</italic> like any layman.</p>
<p>3. If a reader, having made a mistake, became confused and did not know where to resume, another person, after awhile takes his place. If he made a mistake in connection with the blessing concerning heretics, the congregation does not wait for him, but another person immediately takes his place, for possibly he may have become tainted with heresy. This rule holds good if he had not yet begun reciting this blessing. But if he had commenced it, the congregants wait for him awhile.</p>
<p>4. The person asked to act as substitute should not decline. At which part of the <italic>Amidah</italic> does the substitute start? At the beginning of the blessing in which the first reader had made the mistake, provided that it had occurred in one of the intermediate blessings. If the mistake had been made in one of the first three blessings, the substitute starts at the beginning of the <italic>Amidah.</italic> If the mistake occurred in one of the last three blessings, the second reader begins with the blessing relating to the restoration of the ancient Temple service.</p>
<p>5. If one says: I will not proceed to the reading desk as my garments are coloured, he is not permitted to act as reader in that service even when robed in white vestments. If one says: I will not proceed to the reading desk because I wear shoes, he does not act as reader even when he is barefoot.</p>
<p>6. Whoever is uncertain whether he has or has not recited the <italic>Amidah,</italic> does not repeat it unless he has the intention of reciting it as a voluntary offering; for a private person may, if he wishes, recite the <italic>Amidah</italic> the whole day as a free will offering. If one, during his recital of the <italic>Amidah,</italic> recalled that he had already read it, he stops even in the middle of a blessing. This however is not the rule in regard to the Evening <italic>Amidah</italic> because, from the outset, he only recited it with the understanding that it was not obligatory.</p>
<p>7. If one, in error, recited the week day <italic>Amidah</italic> on the Sabbath, he has not fulfilled his duty. If he realizes his mistake, while still engaged in the <italic>Amidah,</italic> he concludes the blessing which he has already begun and then recites the blessing appertaining to the Sabbath. This rule applies to the evening, morning and afternoon services. If the error occurred in the additional service, he stops even in the middle of a blessing. So it is also, if he concluded the Week day <italic>Amidah,</italic> under the impression that it was the additional service for the Sabbath, Festival or New Moon as the case may be.</p>
<p>8. If one, in the winter, erroneously omitted both phrases, &#x201C;Who causeth the rain to descend&#x201D; and also &#x201C;Who causeth the dew to descend&#x201D;, he should turn back to the beginning of the Amidah. If he recited the phrase referring to the dew, he does not turn back. If, in the summer, one said, in error, &#x201C;Who causeth the rain to descend&#x201D;, he turns back to the beginning of the Amidah. If he omitted the phrase referring to the dew, he is not directed to read the <italic>Amidah</italic> again from the beginning, because the dew is never withheld and does not need a special petition.</p>
<p>9. If one forgot to include the petition &#x201C;Give dew and rain&#x201D; in the blessing relating to prosperity for the year and became aware of his omission before reciting the blessing which concludes, &#x201C;Who heareth prayer&#x201D;, he recites the petition for rain in the latter blessing. If he only became aware of the omission after reciting this blessing he turns back to the blessing relating to prosperity for the year. If he did not become aware of his omission till he had completed the entire <italic>Amidah,</italic> he turns back to the beginning and recites the whole of it a second time.</p>
<p>10. If one made a mistake and did not recite the paragraph beginning, &#x201C;May our memorial ascend and come etc.&#x201D; (specially recited on New Moons and festivals) and became aware of his omission before he had concluded the <italic>Amidah,</italic> he turns back to the blessing relating to the restoration of the Temple service and includes the paragraph omitted. If he became aware of his omission after he had concluded the <italic>Amidah,</italic> he turns back to its beginning. If he was wont to add propitiatory prayers after the <italic>Amidah,</italic> and became aware of his omission of them after he had completed the <italic>Amidah</italic> but before he had stepped back at its conclusion he turns back to the blessing relating to the restoration of the Temple service.</p>
<p>11. These rules apply to the <italic>Amidah</italic> on the intermediate days of the festivals as well as the morning and afternoon <italic>Amidah</italic> of the New Moon. But if one did not recite this paragraph in the <italic>Amidah</italic> of the evening service of the New Moon, he does not turn back.<xref rid="fn27">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>12. In all cases where an individual praying for himself has to recite the <italic>Amidah</italic> a second time, the reader of the congregation does likewise, if he committed a similar error when reciting the <italic>Amidah</italic> aloud. The morning service on the first day of the month forms an exception. If on such a day, the reader forgot to recite the added passage beginning, &#x201C;May it ascend and come&#x201D;, till he had concluded the <italic>Amidah,</italic> he is not to read it a second time, so as not to incommode the congregation. The reason is that he has still to read the additional service which contains a reference to the first day of the month.</p>
<p>13. During the ten days from the New Year to the Day of Atonement, if, by mistake, one concluded the third blessing with the phrase, &#x201C;the holy God&#x201D; (instead of &#x201C;the holy King&#x201D;), he turns back to the beginning of the <italic>Amidah.</italic> If by mistake, one concluded the eleventh blessing, &#x201C;King who loveth righteousness and judgment&#x201D; (instead of King of judgment) he turns back to the beginning of this blessing, and concludes it with the phrase &#x201C;King of judgment&#x201D;. He then continues the service in the regular order. If he did not become aware of the error till he had concluded the entire <italic>Amidah,</italic> he turns back to its beginning. This rule applies to an individual praying for himself and to the Reader of the congregation reciting the <italic>Amidah</italic> aloud.</p>
<p>14. If, in the fourth blessing ending, &#x201C;Who graciously grantest knowledge&#x201D;, one has omitted,<xref rid="fn28">&#x002A;</xref> by error, the passage referring to the distinction between sacred and profane, he concludes the <italic>Amidah</italic> and is not bound to repeat it. So too, if one forgot on the Feast of Lights or on the Feast of Lots, to recite the passage beginning, &#x201C;For the miracles&#x201D;, or, on a fast day, the prayer beginning, &#x201C;Answer us&#x201D;, he does not recite the Amidah a second time. This rule applies to an individual praying privately and to the Reader of the congregation. If, [on a fast day] one becomes aware of the omission before he steps back at the conclusion of the <italic>Amidah,</italic> he says, &#x201C;Answer us, for Thou hearest prayer, delivering and saving us at all times of trouble and distress. May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before Thee, etc.&#x201D;.</p>
<p>15. One who forgot to recite the afternoon service on the eve of the Sabbath should recite the Sabbath <italic>Amidah</italic> for the Friday evening twice. There is a similar rule in the case of the eve of a festival. One who forgot to recite the afternoon service on a sabbath or festival, recites the <italic>Amidah</italic> in the evening service after the close of the festival twice&#x2014;both <italic>Amidahs</italic> being those recited on a week day. The passage referring to the distinction between sacred and profane is included in the first, not in the second. If it was included in both or omitted from both, he has fulfilled his duty. But if it was omitted from the first recital and included in the second, he has to recite the <italic>Amidah</italic> a third time, the first recital not being counted, as it took place before the <italic>Amidah</italic> proper to the evening. When one recites two services, even the morning and additional services, one should not recite the second immediately after the first but pause between, so as to obtain a proper frame of mind.</p>
<p>16. Whoever joins in public worship is forbidden to say his prayers in advance of the congregation. A person entering a synagogue and finding the congregation silently reciting the <italic>Amidah</italic> should also recite it, provided that he can begin and conclude it before the Reader, in his repetition, reaches the <italic>Kedushah.</italic> If he is unable to do so, he should wait till the Reader begins the repetition and then silently recite the <italic>Amidah</italic> with the Reader, word for word till the latter comes to the <italic>Kedushah,</italic> when he should join in the congregational responses to the <italic>Kedushah</italic> after which he recites the rest of the <italic>Amidah</italic> for himself. If he commenced the <italic>Amidah</italic> before the Reader began to recite it aloud, and the Reader reaches the <italic>Kedushah,</italic> he should neither stop nor utter the responses in the <italic>Kedushah.</italic> So too, he should not utter the response &#x201C;Amen. May His great name be blessed; and, needless to add, he should not do so if the Reader is reciting other blessings.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER XI.</h1>
<p>1. Wherever there are ten Israelites resident, an edifice must be fitted up, where they can assemble for worship at each period of prayer. Such a building is termed a synagogue. The residents exercise compulsory powers on each other for the purpose of erecting a synagogue and purchasing a scroll of the Law (Pentateuch), the prophetical books and the Hagiography.</p>
<p>2. When a synagogue is to be built, the highest part of the town should be selected for the site, as it is said, &#x201C;At the head of the noisy streets she [Wisdom] calleth&#x201D; (Proverbs 1:21). The building is to be raised sufficiently high to overtop all the other courtyards of the town, as it is said, &#x201C;To exalt the house of our God.&#x201D; (Ezra 9:9). The doors of the Synagogue are to be made to open only on the East side, as it is said, &#x201C;And those who encamped before the Tabernacle eastwards&#x201D; (Numbers 3:38). Within, a shrine is built to contain a scroll of the Law. This shrine is erected on the side towards which the people in that town turn when praying, so that when they are standing engaged in prayer, they will face the shrine. In the centre of the building, a platform is erected, which the Reader of the lesson from the Pentateuch or whoever exhorts the people mounts, so that all the congregation may hear. The desk (<italic>Tebah</italic>) on which the scroll is placed (when reading the <italic>Torah</italic>) is set up in the centre,<xref rid="fn29">&#x002A;</xref> its back towards the Shrine, its front facing the people.</p>
<p>3. How are the people seated in synagogues? The elders sit facing the congregation with their backs to the Shrine. The people are seated in rows, one behind the other, the front of each row being at the rear of the one before it, so that all the people are facing the Shrine, the elders and the desk. When the reader stands up to recite the (<italic>Amidah</italic>) prayer, he stands on the floor before the <italic>Tebah</italic><xref rid="fn30">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> and, like the rest of the congregation, his face is turned to the Shrine.</p>
<p>4. Synagogues and houses of study must be treated with respect. They are swept and sprinkled to lay the dust. In Spain and the West (Morocco), in Babylon and in the Holy Land, it is customary to kindle lamps in the synagogues and to spread mats on the floor on which the worshippers sit. In the lands of Edom (Christian countries) they sit in synagogues on chairs [or benches].</p>
<p>5. There must be no light behaviour in synagogues and houses of study; no jesting, no mockery or idle talk. One may not eat or drink, indulge in physical recreation or promenade there. One may not enter, during the summer, to seek relief from the heat; or, in the winter, to obtain shelter from the rain.</p>
<p>6. Nor are calculations to be made in them, unless these are in connection with a religious duty; for example, counting the contents of the charity box or the proceeds of a collection for redemption of captives etc. Funeral addresses are only delivered in them when these are of public interest, as for example for the great religious authorities of the city, which would be attended by the entire community.</p>
<p>7. Where a synagogue or house of study has two doors, one may not use it as a passage, entering at one door and leaving by the other to shorten a journey, since it is forbidden to enter these buildings except to fulfill a religious duty.</p>
<p>8. If one has occasion to go into a synagogue to call a child or other person, he may go in, but should read some portion of Scripture or recite a traditional dictum, so that his entry shall not be for the sake of his private affairs only. If he has no knowledge he should say to one of the children, &#x201C;Recite to me the verse which you are now reading&#x201D; or he should stay a while in the synagogue and then leave, for staying there is also a religious act, as it is said, &#x201C;Happy are they that dwell in Thy house&#x201D; (Psalms 84:5).</p>
<p>9. One who entered a synagogue to pray or read Scripture may leave at the opposite door to that by which he entered, in order to take a short cut. A person may go into a synagogue with his staff, shoes, moneybelt and with dust on his feet. If he has need to do so, he may expectorate in the synagogue.</p>
<p>10. Synagogues and houses of study that are in ruins retain their sacred character, as it is said, &#x201C;And I will desolate your sanctuaries&#x201D; (Leviticus 26:31)&#x2014;even when desolate they still retain their sacred character. The same respect must be shown them when they are in ruins as when they were sound and in use. The only difference is in regard to sweeping and laying the dust. Synagogues in ruins are not swept nor sprinkled to lay the dust. If grass has sprung up in them, the blades are plucked and left there, so that the people may be stirred to rebuild the ruined edifices.</p>
<p>11. A synagogue may not be demolished with the intention to build another on the same site or on a different site. The proposed synagogue must first be erected, and then the existing structure may be demolished, for fear that a mishap may occur which will prevent the people building. This rule applies even to the erection of a single wall. The new wall must first be set up adjacent to the old wall, which may then be demolished.</p>
<p>12. These rules apply to a structure, of which the foundations are not decayed. But if the foundations are failing or the walls threaten to collapse, the edifice is immediately demolished and work on the new building should be started at once, and proceed expeditiously by day and by night, for fear that there may be delay and the edifice would become a complete ruin.</p>
<p>13. A synagogue may be turned into a house of study, but a house of study may not be turned into a synagogue; the reason being that the sanctity of a house of study exceeds that of a synagogue and objects may be raised to a holier use but not degraded to a less holy use. On the same principle, the residents of a town who sold a synagogue should use the proceeds to purchase a <italic>Tebah</italic>.<xref rid="fn31">&#x002A;</xref> If they sold a <italic>Tebah,</italic> they should buy with the proceeds wraps or a case for the scroll of the law. If they sold wraps or a case for the scroll of the law, they should use the proceeds to purchase single books of the Pentateuch. If they sold single books of the Pentateuch, they should buy with the proceeds a scroll of the law. But if they sold a scroll of the law, nothing else can be bought with the proceeds but another scroll of the law, for there is nothing that exceeds the sanctity of a scroll of the law. This same principle applies to money left over from proceeds of sales of sacred articles after other articles of higher sanctity had been purchased.</p>
<p>14. So too, if the people had collected money to build a house of study or a synagogue, or to buy a <italic>Tebah,</italic> or wraps and a case (for a scroll of the law) or a scroll of the law, and they desire to use all the money for another purpose, they may only do so if the substitute to be bought is of a higher sanctity. If however the original purpose for which the collection had been made was accomplished, and a surplus was left over, they can use it for any purpose they please. All the appurtenances of a synagogue are in the same category with the synagogue. The curtain above the ark in which the scrolls are placed are in the same class with the wraps of the scrolls. If stipulations had been made with regard to the articles, these stipulations have to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>15. The statement that it is permitted to sell a synagogue only refers to a synagogue, erected in a village for the use of the villagers, that they may have a place where to pray. If all of them agree to sell it, they may do so. But as to a synagogue in a city, since it was built as a public place of worship for all, where any one who comes to that district shall be able to pray, it constitutes the public property of all Israel and may never be sold.</p>
<p>16. Villagers who desire to sell their synagogue, in order to erect with the proceeds another synagogue or purchase a <italic>Tebah</italic> or a scroll of the law, should stipulate with the purchaser that he is not to turn it into a bathhouse, tannery, ritual bath or laundry. If, at the time of the sale, the seven leaders of the community (forming the Executive), at a meeting of the residents, passed a resolution that the purchaser should be permitted to do any of the above things, it is permitted.</p>
<p>17. So too, if the seven leaders of the community, at a meeting of the residents, resolve that the surplus of the purchase money be used for secular purposes, it may be so used. And when they receive the funds and expend them in the erection of another synagogue, or in the purchase of a <italic>Tebah,</italic> wraps, a case for a scroll of the law, or a Scroll of the law, or copies of single books of the Pentateuch, the surplus is secular in accordance with their resolution, and may be used for any purpose they please.</p>
<p>18. So too, if all the residents or a majority of them have vested a single individual with authority over them, whatever he does is valid. He can, in his discretion sell or give away, and make any stipulations he deems fit.</p>
<p>19. Just as they are permitted to sell a synagogue, so they may give it away; for unless the community derived some advantage from the gift, they would not have made the gift. They must not however let their synagogue for rent or pledge it as security for a loan. So too, when synagogues are demolished to be rebuilt, the bricks, wood and earth may be sold, exchanged or given away, but not loaned, because the sanctity attached to the material passes only if money or a benefit equivalent to money is obtained in return.</p>
<p>20. The broadway of a town, though the people worship there on fast-days and at special services,&#x2014;the assemblies on such occasions being too large for the synagogues to accomodate&#x2014;has no sanctity because its sacred use is casual and it has not been appointed for worship. Similarly, houses and courts where people meet for prayer have no sanctity, because they have not been set apart for worship but are only so used casually, just as a man prays in his own home.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER XII.</h1>
<p>1. Moses, our teacher, established the rule for Israel that they should read the Law publicly on Sabbaths and also on the second and fifth days of the week, during the morning service, so that three days shall not elapse without hearing the Law. Ezra established the rule that the <italic>Torah</italic> should be read at the afternoon service, every Sabbath for the benefit of those who would otherwise spend the day vacuously. He also ordained that on the second and fifth days of the week, three persons should be called to the reading of the Law and that they should read not less than three verses each.</p>
<p>2. The following are the days on which the Law is publicly read: Sabbaths, Festivals, the first day of each month, Fast-days, the Feast of Dedication, the Feast of Lots, the second and fifth day of the week. Lessons from the Prophets are only read on Sabbaths, Festivals and the ninth day of Ab.<xref rid="fn32">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>3. The <italic>Torah</italic> is not read publicly unless at least ten male Israelites&#x2014;all adults and freemen&#x2014;are present. A minimum of ten verses must be read. The introductory verse, &#x201C;And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying&#x201D; is counted among the ten verses. Not less than three must be called to the reading of the Law. They do not begin to read at a place less than three verses from the beginning of a section, nor do they end at a place less than three verses from the close of a section. No reader may read less than three verses.</p>
<p>4. When ten verses are read by three persons, two of them read three verses each, and one reads four verses. The one who reads the four verses, whether he is the first, last or intermediate reader, is praiseworthy.</p>
<p>5. Each reader opens the scroll of the law, looks at the place where he will read and recites the invocation, &#x201C;Bless ye the Lord, who is blessed.&#x201D; The congregation responds, &#x201C;Blessed is the Lord, who is blessed for ever and ever.&#x201D; He then recites the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast<xref rid="fn33">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> chosen us from all peoples and given<xref rid="fn33">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> us Thy Law. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who givest<xref rid="fn34">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> the law.&#x201D; The congregation responds Amen. He then reads his section, till he concludes it, rolls up the scroll, and then recites the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hath given us a Law of truth and planted eternal life in our midst, blessed art Thou O Lord, Who giveth the Law.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6. A person who reads the Law must not begin till the sound of the Amen recited by the congregation has ceased. If he made a mistake, even if only in the correct enunciation of a single letter, he is made to turn back to the place where the mistake was made and read the word correctly. Two are not to read in the <italic>Torah</italic> at the same time, but only one by himself. If one, while reading, has been suddenly stricken so that he cannot continue, another person should take his place and begin where the stricken one began, and recite the blessing after reading his portion.</p>
<p>7. The person who reads may not do so till the chief member of the congregation invites him to do so. Even the appointed officer of the synagogue or its president does not read, at his own volition, but waits till the congregation or its chief member tells him to do so. And some one should stand at his side, while he is reading, just as the appointed officer stands at the side of other persons who read.</p>
<p>8. The reader has (sometimes<xref rid="fn35">&#x2020;</xref>) to skip from passage to passage&#x2014;both being on the same theme&#x2014;as, for instance, that beginning, &#x201C;.&#x2026; After the death of the two sons of Aaron&#x201D; (Leviticus chapter 16 verse 1) to that beginning, &#x201C;And on the tenth day of this seventh month&#x201D; (Numbers 29:7-11) which is in the weekly portion <italic>Emor.</italic> But he must take care not to recite by heart, it being forbidden to recite even a single word without referring to the text. Nor, when skipping, may he pause for a longer time than it takes the interpreter to translate the last verse [of the former passage].</p>
<p>9. As soon as he has begun to read in the <italic>Torah,</italic> it is forbidden to converse even on a Halachic topic. All must listen silently and give heed to what he is reading, as it is said, &#x201C;And the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the Law&#x201D; (Nehemiah 8:3). It is likewise forbidden to leave the synagogue while the <italic>Torah</italic> is being read. But one may leave in the interval between one section and another. A person who is continuously engaged in the study of the <italic>Torah,</italic> this being his sole occupation, may continue his study while the Law is being read.</p>
<p>10. Since the days of Ezra it has been the rule that an interpreter shall be present to interpret to the people what the reader is reading in the <italic>Torah,</italic> so that they may understand the subject-matter. The reader reads one verse only, waits till the interpreter has interpreted it, and then reads the next verse. The reader may not read to the interpreter more than one verse at a time.</p>
<p>11. The reader may not raise his voice above that of the interpreter nor may the interpreter raise his voice above that of the reader. The interpreter may not begin to translate till the sound of the verse uttered by the reader has ceased. The reader may not read the next verse till the interpreter&#x2019;s translation of the previous verse is ended. The interpreter is not to lean against a pillar or beam, but stands in reverence and awe. He does not read the translation from a script but translates it by heart. The reader may not prompt the interpreter so that it should not be said that the translation is written in the <italic>Torah.</italic> A minor (under thirteen years) may act as interpreter to an adult who is reading. But it is not respectful to an adult that he should act as interpreter to a minor who is reading. There should not be two interpreters acting together. But one reads and one interprets.</p>
<p>12. Not all verses are translated in public. The story of Reuben (Genesis 35:22), The Priestly Benediction (Numbers 6:24-26), the story of the Golden Calf from &#x201C;And Moses said to Aaron&#x201D; till &#x201C;And Moses saw the people etc.&#x201D; (Exodus 32:21-25) and the verse, &#x201C;And God plagued the people&#x201D; (Exodus 32:35) are read and not translated. In the story of Amnon (II Samuel c. 13) where the phrase, &#x201C;Amnon, son of David&#x201D; occurs, it is read and not translated.</p>
<p>13. The person who concludes with the lesson from the prophets has first to read in the Torah, even if it is only three verses. He may repeat what the previous reader has already read. He must not read the lesson from the Prophets till the Scroll of the Law has first been rolled up. He should not read less than twenty-one verses from the prophet. If the topic of the lesson is concluded in a smaller number of verses, he need not read more. If he read ten verses and the interpreter translated them, that is sufficient, even though the topic is not completed. Only one reads the lesson from the prophets, but two may act as interpreters. He may skip from one subject to another, but not from one prophetical book to another except in the minor Prophets; and there he must not pass from the end of the book to the beginning. When skipping, he must not pause longer than it takes the interpreter to recite his translation of what has been read.</p>
<p>14. The person who reads the lesson from the prophets should read for the interpreter three verses, and the interpreter translates the three one after another, but if the three verses are separate sections, he should read for the interpreter one verse at a time.</p>
<p>15. The person who reads the lesson from the prophets, recites, before doing so, one blessing as follows: &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast<xref rid="fn36">&#x002A;</xref> chosen good prophets etc.&#x201D;; and after the lesson, he recites four blessings. The first blessing he concludes with the formula, &#x201C;O Lord, God Who are faithful in all Thy words<xref rid="fn37">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref>&#x201D;; the second with the formula, &#x201C;Who rebuildest Jerusalem&#x201D;; (Spanish and German rituals have &#x201C;Who makest Zion joyful through her children&#x201D;) the third, with the formula, &#x201C;Shield of David&#x201D;; the fourth with a formula referring to the special character of the day&#x2014;identical with the conclusion of the middle blessing in the <italic>Amidah</italic> prayer for the day. So if the first day of the month falls on a Sabbath, the person who reads the lesson from the prophets mentions the first day of the month in this blessing, as he does in the <italic>Amidah.</italic> How many persons read the Law? On Sabbath, in the morning service, seven read the Law; on the Day of Atonement, six; on the festivals, five. These respective numbers may not be diminished but may be increased. On the first day of each month, and on the intermediate days of the festivals, four read the Law. On Sabbath and on the Day of Atonement in the afternoon services, on the second and fifth day of the week throughout the year in the morning service, on the Feast of Lights and on the Feast of Lots in the morning service, and on fast-days in the morning and in the afternoon services, three read the Law. These numbers are neither increased nor diminished.</p>
<p>16. A woman should not read the Law at a congregational service, out of respect to the congregation. A minor who can read and understands to whom the blessings are offered may be counted in the number of those who read the Law. The person who reads the lesson from the Prophets is also counted in their number, since he reads in the <italic>Torah</italic> as well. If, however, the reader of the congregation intervened with the recital of <italic>Kaddish</italic> between the reader of the concluding section of the Pentateuchal portion for the day and the reader of the lesson from the Prophets, the latter is not counted in the number of those who read the Law. In a congregation where there is only one individual competent to read, he goes up to the reading-desk, reads a section, goes down, then goes up again and reads a second section, does the same a third time and so on till he has completed the number of those who should have read that day.</p>
<p>17. In each and every one of these readings, a <italic>Cohen</italic> (descendant of Aaron) reads the first section. He is followed by a Levite (descendant of Levi other than a Cohen) and he, in turn, is followed by an Israelite. It is a universal custom that a <italic>Cohen,</italic> even though he is illiterate, has precedence over a great scholar in Israel. The person, superior in knowledge reads before one who is his inferior. The reader of the concluding section who rolls up the Scroll will receive a reward equal to that of all the others. Hence, even the greatest man in the congregation goes up [to the reading desk] to complete the portion.</p>
<p>18. Should no <italic>Cohen</italic> be present, an Israelite goes up to read the <italic>Torah</italic> and a Levite should not follow. Should no Levite be present, the <italic>Cohen</italic> who read the first section, reads the second section in place of a Levite. Another <italic>Cohen</italic> however does not read after the first, lest it be said that the one first called up was unfit and that therefore another <italic>Cohen</italic> went up. So too, one Levite does not read after another, lest it be said that one of them is unfit.</p>
<p>19. At which part of the service is the <italic>Torah</italic> read? On the days when an additional <italic>Amidah</italic> is recited&#x2014;the Reader, having concluded the morning service, recites <italic>Kaddish;</italic> takes out a scroll of the Law, and calls members of the congregation individually, who come up and read in the Law. When they have concluded, he replaces the scroll and recites <italic>Kaddish;</italic> and then the additional service is recited. On days when a lesson from the prophets is read as well as the additional service, it is the usual custom to recite <italic>Kaddish</italic> before the person comes up to read the lesson from the prophets. In some communities however, <italic>Kaddish</italic> is recited after the lesson from the prophets has been read.</p>
<p>20. In the afternoon service on Sabbath or on the Day of Atonement, the Reader, after he has ended the recital of the Psalm of David (Psalm 145) and of the Order of Sanctification,<xref rid="fn38">&#x002A;</xref> recites <italic>Kaddish,</italic> and takes out the scroll of the Law, which is read by members of the congregation. He then replaces the scroll and recites <italic>Kaddish.</italic> The afternoon <italic>Amidah</italic> is then recited. On Festivals, it is not customary to read the Law during the afternoon service.</p>
<p>21. On a day when no additional service is recited, the reader, after concluding the morning <italic>Amidah</italic> recites <italic>Kaddish</italic> and takes out a scroll of the Law which is read. He then replaces it, recites <italic>Kaddish,</italic> then repeats Psalm 145 and the &#x201C;Order of Sanctification&#x201D;, as on other days, recites <italic>Kaddish,</italic> after which the people depart.</p>
<p>22. Scrolls of single books of the Pentateuch are not used for reading at services in synagogues, out of respect to the congregation. Nor is the scroll of the Law rolled<xref rid="fn39">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> at a public service, out of regard to the convenience of the congregants so that they should not have the trouble of standing while the scroll is being rolled. Hence, if two sections in different parts of the text are to be read, two scrolls are taken out. One person must not read one section in two scrolls, lest it will be said that the first scroll was defective and therefore he read out of the second.</p>

<h1>CHAPTER XIII.</h1>
<p>The Paragraphs in the following chapters are only separated by blank spaces in the manuscript. The numbers are those in the extant editions.</p>
<p>1. The custom prevailing through Israel is [that the reading of the Pentateuch is completed in one year]<xref rid="fn43">&#x2020;&#x2020;</xref>. It is begun on the Sabbath after the feast of Tabernacles, when the portion commencing <italic>Bereshith</italic> &#x201C;In the Beginning&#x201D; (Genesis 1:1) is read. On the second Sabbath, that beginning, &#x201C;These are the generations of Noah&#x201D; (Genesis 6:9) is read; on the third, that beginning, &#x201C;And the Lord said to Abraham&#x201D; (ibid. 12:1), and so on in regular order till the last portion is read on the feat of Tabernacles. Some complete the reading of the Pentateuch in three years, but this is not a prevalent custom.</p>
<p>2. Ezra instituted the rule for Israel that the portion containing the Imprecations in the book of Leviticus (26:3-end of book) should be read before the feast of Pentecost; and those in the book of Deuteronomy (26:1-29:8) before the New Year. The prevalent custom is to read the portion <italic>Bemidbar Sinai</italic> (Numbers 1:1-4:20) before Pentecost; <italic>Vaethchanan</italic> (Deuteronomy 3:23-7:11) after the Ninth of Ab; <italic>Atem Nitzabim</italic> (Deuteronomy 29:9-30:20) before the New Year; <italic>Tzav ess Aharon</italic> (Leviticus 6:1-8:36) before Passover in an ordinary year (of twelve months). Hence, on some Sabbaths, two portions are read during the morning service, for example, <italic>Isha Ki Tazria</italic> (Leviticus 12:1-13:59) and <italic>Vezoth tihejeh Torath Hametzora</italic> (ibid. 14:1-15:33); <italic>Bechukotai</italic> (ibid. 26:3-end of book) and <italic>Behar Sinai</italic> (ibid. 25:1-26:2) etc.; the purpose being to ensure that the reading of the Pentateuch shall be completed in one year and that the portions above mentioned shall be read at their appointed periods.</p>
<p>3. At the place in the <italic>Torah</italic> where the reading is ended in the morning service, it is resumed, with the next verse, in the afternoon service of that day, in the morning services of the coming Monday and Thursday, and also in the moring service of the next Sabbath. For example, on the first Sabbath (after the feast of Tabernacles) the portion <italic>Bereshith</italic> is read during the morning service. In the afternoon service ten or more verses are read from the beginning of the portion, <italic>Eleh Toledoth Noach;</italic> as also on the following Monday and Thursday. On the next Sabbath likewise, in the morning service <italic>Eleh Toledoth Noach</italic> is begun and read to the close of the portion for the week. This method is followed throughout the year. The reading of the portion from the Pentateuch is followed by a section from the prophets, corresponding in content with what had been read in the Pentateuch.</p>
<p>4. On the first day of each month, the person first called to the reading of the Law reads three verses from the section beginning <italic>Tzav</italic> (Numbers 28:1-8). The second person called to the Law repeats the third verse already read by the person called before him and adds the two following verses, so as to leave three verses to the end of the section. The third person called to the Law reads these three verses and also the next section beginning <italic>Uveyom Hashabbath</italic> (ibid. 28:9-10). The fourth person called to the Law reads the section beginning <italic>Uvrash&#x00E9; Chodshechem</italic> (ibid. 28:11-15). When the first of the month falls on a Sabbath, two scrolls of the Law are taken out during the morning service. In the first, the portion for the week is read; and in the second, the one who completes the reading reads <italic>Uverash&#x00E9; Chodshechem</italic> (Numbers 28:11-15). The person who reads the lesson from the Prophets is the one who reads the section concerning the New Moon. The lesson from the Prophets is that section which concludes, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass that month by month etc.&#x201D; (Isaiah 66:23). When the first of Ab falls on a Sabbath, the lesson from the prophets is the section containing the verses, &#x201C;Your new moons and your festivals my soul hateth&#x201D; (ibid. 1:14). When the first day of the month falls on the first day of the week the lesson from the prophets on the preceding Sabbath day is the section beginning, &#x201C;And Jonathan said unto him; tomorrow is New Moon&#x201D; (I Samuel 20:18-42).</p>
<p>5. Every one who goes up to read the Law commences and concludes with a happy theme. But in the weekly portion of <italic>Haazinu</italic> (Deuteronomy, Chapter 32), the first one who is called up reads up to &#x201C;Remember the days of old&#x201D; (verse 7). The second begins, &#x201C;Remember the days of old&#x201D; and reads up to &#x201C;He made him ride on the high places of the earth&#x201D; (v. 13). The third from that verse to, &#x201C;And the Lord saw and spurned&#x201D; (v. 19). The fourth, from that verse to, &#x201C;If they were wise&#x201D; (v. 29). The fifth, from that verse to &#x201C;For I lift up my hand to heaven&#x201D; (v. 40). The sixth, from that verse to the end of the Song (v. 43). Why do they leave off at these points? Because they are rebukes, and so the people will be induced to repent.</p>
<p>6. The eight verses which conclude the Pentateuch (Deuteronomy 34:5-12) may be read in synagogue even when there are less than ten (male adults) present. Though it is all <italic>Torah</italic> and Moses uttered them as received from the mouth of the Almighty, still as they convey the thought that they were composed after Moses&#x2019; death, they have clearly been altered (from the text as it stood originally). An individual may therefore read them (without a quorum).</p>
<p>7. The Maledictions in the book of Leviticus (26:14-43) are not broken up among different readers; but one person reads them all, beginning with the verse before, and closing with the verse after them.<xref rid="fn44">&#x002A;</xref> As to the Maledictions in the book of Deuteronomy, one may, if he wishes, break off in the middle. The people have, however, the custom not to do so; but one person reads them all.</p>
<p>8. The regular sequence is interrupted for the three Festivals and for the Day of Atonement, when we read a section appertaining to the Festival and not the weekly portion of the Sabbath. Moses ordained that on each festival a section bearing upon it should be read. On every festival too, the discussion and discourse are on the topic of the day. What sections are read? On Passover, from the section concerning the festivals in the book of Leviticus (22:26-23:44). The people have however the custom of reading on the first day that beginning, &#x201C;Draw out, and take unto yourselves lambs (Exodus 12:21-51); and the lesson from the Prophets is the account of the Passover at Gilgal (Joshua 5:2-15). On the second day, that beginning, &#x201C;When a bullock or sheep&#x201D; (Leviticus 22:26-23:44); and the lesson from the Prophets is the account of Josiah&#x2019;s Celebration of the Passover (II Kings 23:1-25). On the third day, that beginning, &#x201C;Sanctify unto me all the first born&#x201D; (Exodus 13:1-16). On the fourth day, that beginning, &#x201C;If thou lend money&#x201D; (Exodus 22:24-23:19). On the fifth day, that beginning, &#x201C;Hew thee two tables of stone&#x201D; (ibid. 34:1-26). On the sixth day, that beginning, &#x201C;Let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season&#x201D; (Numbers 9:1-14). On the seventh day, that beginning, &#x201C;And it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go&#x201D; (Exodus 13:17-15:26) to the end of the Song, and up to the words &#x201C;I am the Lord that healeth thee&#x201D;; and the lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, &#x201C;And David spoke&#x201D; (II Samuel 22:1-51). On the eighth day, that beginning, &#x201C;All the firstling males&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17); and the lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, &#x201C;This very day&#x201D; (Isaiah 10:32-12:6).</p>
<p>9. On Pentecost, the section from the Pentateuch is that beginning, &#x201C;Seven weeks&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 16:9-17). But the general custom is to read on the first day of the feast the section beginning, &#x201C;In the third month&#x201D; (Exodus 19:1-20:26). And the lesson from the Prophets is &#x201C;The vision of the Chariots&#x201D; (Ezekiel 1:1-28). On the second day the section read is that concerning the Festivals, beginning, &#x201C;All the firstling males&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17) and the lesson from the Prophets is taken from Habakuk (3:1-end).</p>
<p>10. On New Year, the section is that beginning, &#x201C;And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month&#x201D; (Numbers 29:1). It is however a general custom to read on the first day the section beginning, &#x201C;And the Lord remembered Sarah&#x201D; (Genesis 21:1-34); and the lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, &#x201C;Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim&#x2014;zophim&#x201D; (I Samuel 1:1-2:10). On the second day, the section read is that beginning, &#x201C;And it came to pass after these things that God did prove Abraham&#x201D; (Genesis 22:1-24); and the lesson from the Prophets is that concluding, &#x201C;Is Ephraim a darling son unto me&#x201D; (Jeremiah 31:1-19).</p>
<p>11. On the Day of Atonement, in the morning service, the section read is that beginning, &#x201C;After the death of the two sons of Aaron&#x201D; (Leviticus 16:1-34); and the lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, &#x201C;For thus saith the High and Lofty One&#x201D; (Isaiah 57:15-58:14). In the afternoon service, the section read is that concerning Incests in the portion beginning, &#x201C;After the death of the two sons of Aaron&#x201D; (Leviticus Chapter 18). The purpose aimed at is that anyone who has been guilty of any of these offences should remember and be abashed. The third person called up reads in the <italic>Torah</italic> and recites, as the lesson from the Prophets, the book of Jonah.</p>
<p>12. On the feast of Tabernacles, the section read on each of the first two days is that referring to the Festivals and beginning, &#x201C;When a bullock or a sheep or a goat is brought forth&#x201D; (Leviticus 22:26-23:44). The lesson from the Prophets on the first day is that beginning, &#x201C;Behold, a day of the Lord cometh&#x201D; (Zechariah 14:1-21). The lesson from the Prophets on the second day is that beginning, &#x201C;And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Solomon&#x201D; (I Kings 8:2-21). On the eighth day, the section from the Pentateuch is that beginning, &#x201C;Every first born&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 15:19-16:17). The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, &#x201C;And it was so that when Solomon had made an end of prayer&#x201D; (I Kings 8:54-66). On the following day, the weekly portion beginning, &#x201C;And this is the blessing&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 33:1-34:12) is read. The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, &#x201C;And Solomon stood&#x201D; (I Kings 8:22-53). Some read, as the lesson from the Prophets that beginning, &#x201C;Now it came to pass after the death of Moses&#x201D; (Joshua 1:1-18). On the other (intermediate) days of the Feast, the sections concerning the sacrifices for the festival are read (Numbers 29:17-34).</p>
<p>13. How so? On every one of the intermediate days of the festival, two sections of the Pentateuch are read. On the third day of the feast, which is an intermediate day, the <italic>Cohen</italic> (first called to the reading of the Law) reads the section beginning, &#x201C;And on the second day&#x201D; (Numbers 29:17-19). The Levite (the second called) reads the section beginning, &#x201C;And on the third day&#x201D; (ibid, 29:20-22). The Israelite (the third called) reads the section beginning, &#x201C;And on the third day&#x201D; (ibid. 29:20-22). The fourth person called reads the section beginning, &#x201C;And on the second day&#x201D; and that beginning, &#x201C;And on the third day.&#x201D; On the fourth day of the festival, which is the second of the intermediate days, the section beginning, &#x201C;And on the third day&#x201D; and that beginning, &#x201C;And on the fourth day&#x201D; are read in this way. The same order is followed throughout the intermediate days.</p>
<p>14. On every festival, and likewise on the Day of Atonement and on all the seven days of Passover, two scrolls of the Law are taken out of the ark. In the first, the sections we have named are read. In the second, the section in the book of Numbers referring to the sacrifice for the day (Numbers 28:16-29:39) is read. The reader of the last reads also the lesson from the Prophets.</p>
<p>15. Whenever two or three scrolls of the Law are taken out of the ark, if they are taken out one after the other, the <italic>Kaddish</italic> is recited after the first is replaced, and then the second is taken out. After this has been replaced, <italic>Kaddish</italic> is again recited. We have however already stated that the plain custom is always to recite <italic>Kaddish</italic> after the person last called to read has finished reading, and then the lesson from the Prophets is read.</p>
<p>16. On the intermediate Sabbath of Passover or Tabernacles, the section read is that beginning, &#x201C;See, Thou sayest unto me&#x201D; (Exodus 33:12-34:26). The lesson from the Prophets, on Passover, is Ezekiel&#x2019;s vision of the Valley of Dry Bones (Ezekiel 37:1-14); and, on Tabernacles the Prediction concerning Gog (ibid. 38:18-39:16).</p>
<p>17. On the first day of the Feast of Dedication, the section read is that containing the Priestly Benediction and continuing till the end of the section referring to the offering on the first day of the Dedication of the Tabernacle (Numbers 6:22-7:17). On the second day, the section read is that referring to the offering of the prince who brought his offering on the second day of that Dedication (ibid. 7:18-23). And so on till the eighth day, the section read is that referring to the offering on the eighth day of the Dedication of the Tabernacle up to the end of the summary of the offerings and continuing till the end of the weekly portion (ibid. 7:54-89).<xref rid="fn45">&#x002A;</xref> On Sabbath, the lesson from the Prophets is Zechariah&#x2019;s Vision of the Candelabrum (Zechariah 2:14-4:7). If there are two Sabbaths in the feast of Dedication, Zechariah&#x2019;s Vision of the Candelabrum is the lesson from the Prophets on the first Sabbath; and, on the second Sabbath, the account of the Candelabra in Solomon&#x2019;s Temple (I Kings 7:40-50) is read. The person who reads in the scroll the special section for the feast of Dedication reads the lesson from the Prophets.</p>
<p>18. On the Feast of Lots, the section beginning, &#x201C;And Amalek came&#x201D; (Exodus 17:8-16) is read in the morning service. On the Ninth of Ab, the section read in the morning service is that beginning, &#x201C;When thou shalt beget children&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 4:25-40). The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, &#x201C;I will consume them&#x201D; (Jeremiah 8:13-9:23). In the afternoon service, the sections beginning, &#x201C;And Moses besought&#x201D; (Exodus 32:11-14) and also (34:1-10) are read, as on the other fast-days and on those that are kept in commemoration of the calamities that befell our ancestors. These sections are read in the morning and afternoon services. The first person called up reads four verses from the section beginning, &#x201C;And Moses besought.&#x201D; The second and third persons read from the section beginning, &#x201C;Hew thee two tables of stone&#x201D; till &#x201C;That I am about to do with thee&#x201D; (Exodus 34:1-10). On fast days appointed by the community because of existing calamities such as drought, pestilence or similar visitations, the Benedictions and Maledictions (Leviticus 26:3-46 or Deuteronomy 28:1-69) are read, so that the people, when they listen to them, may be moved to repent and their hearts be humbled.</p>
<p>19. The people have the custom of reading on the three Sabbaths before the Ninth of Ab, as lessons from the Prophets, passages of an admonitory character. On the first of these Sabbaths, the lesson from the Prophets is the section beginning, &#x201C;The words of Jeremiah&#x201D; (Jeremiah 1:1-2:3). On the second Sabbath, that beginning, &#x201C;The vision of Isaiah&#x201D; (Isaiah 1:1-20). On the third Sabbath, that beginning, &#x201C;How is the faithful city become a harlot&#x201D; (ibid. 1:21-2:4).<xref rid="fn46">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> On the Sabbath after the Ninth of Ab, the lesson from the Prophets is the section beginning, &#x201C;Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people&#x201D; (Isaiah 40:1-26). It is the general custom in our city to read comforting messages from Isaiah as the lessons from the Prophets on the Sabbaths after the Ninth of Ab till the New Year. On the Sabbath between the New Year and the Day of Atonement, the lesson from the Prophets is the section beginning &#x201C;Return O Israel&#x201D; (Hosea 14:2-10).</p>
<p>20. When the first day of the month of Adar falls on a Sabbath, the section concerning the Half Shekel (Exodus 30:11-16) is read; and the lesson from the Prophets is that relating to Jehoiadah the Priest (II Kings 11:17-12:17). When the first of Adar falls on a weekday, even on a Friday, the section concerning the Half-Shekel is read on the previous Sabbath. On the second Sabbath of the month, the section commencing &#x201C;Remember&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 25:17-19) is read. The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning, &#x201C;I remember that which Amalek did to Israel&#x201D; (I Samuel 15:1-34). What is meant by the second Sabbath? It is the Sabbath preceding the week in which the Feast of Lots occurs, even if that falls on Friday. On the third Sabbath, the section concerning the Red Heifer (Numbers 19:1-22) is read. The lesson from the Prophets is that containing the verse, &#x201C;And I will sprinkle upon you&#x201D; (Ezekiel 36:16-36). What is meant by the third Sabbath? That immediately preceding the fourth. On the fourth Sabbath, the section beginning, &#x201C;This month&#x201D; (Exodus 12:1-20) is read. The lesson from the Prophets is that beginning &#x201C;In the first month, on the first day of the month (Ezekiel 45:18-46:15). The fourth Sabbath is that beginning the week in which the first of Nissan occurs, even if it falls on Friday.</p>
<p>21. Hence, there will sometimes be a plain Sabbath (on which no additional section is read) between the first and the second of these four special Sabbaths, or between the second and the third. In some years there will be two such Sabbaths; namely, between the first and second special Sabbaths, and between the second and third. But there is no plain Sabbath between the third and fourth special Sabbaths.</p>
<p>22. Each of these four special sections is read in a second scroll, after the portion for the week has been read in the scroll first taken out. If the first of Adar falls on a Sabbath, and the portion for the week was that commencing, &#x201C;And thou shalt command&#x201D; (Exodus 27:20-30:10), six persons are called to the Law and read in the weekly portion up to (but not including) the section beginning, &#x201C;Thou shalt also make a laver&#x201D; (ibid. 30:17). The seventh person reads the section beginning, &#x201C;When thou takest the sum&#x201D; till that beginning, &#x201C;Thou shalt also make a laver&#x201D; (ibid 30:11-16). If the portion of the week for that Sabbath is that beginning, &#x201C;When thou takest the sum&#x201D; (ibid. 30:11), six persons are called to the Law and read this portion, till the next beginning, &#x201C;And Moses assembled&#x201D; (ibid. 35:1). The seventh person reads in the second scroll the section beginning, &#x201C;When thou takest the sum&#x201D; till &#x201C;Thou shalt make also a laver&#x201D; (ibid. 30:11-16).</p>
<p>23. When the first of Adar falls on Sabbath, three scrolls are taken out. In the first, the portion of the week is read; in the second the section relating to the sacrifices on the first of the month, (Numbers 28:9-15); and in the third, that beginning, &#x201C;When thou takest the sum&#x201D; (Exodus 30:11-16). So too, when the first of Nisan falls on Sabbath, three scrolls are taken out. The portion of the week is read in the first; the section relating to the sacrifices &#x201C;on the first of the month&#x201D; (Numbers 28:9-15) in the second; and, in the third, that commencing, &#x201C;This month&#x201D; (Exodus 12.1-20).</p>
<p>24. When the first of Tebeth falls on Sabbath, three scrolls are taken out. In the first, the portion of the week is read; in the second, the section relating to the sacrifices on the first of the month (Numbers 28:9-15); in the third, the portion read on the feast of Dedication (a section from Numbers 6:22-8:4). When the first of Tebeth falls on a week day, three persons read the section concerning the sacrifices on the first of the month (Numbers 28:9-15); and the fourth person, one of the sections appropriate to the Feast of Dedication (Numbers 6:22-8:4).</p>
<p>25. Although a person hears the whole of the Pentateuch at the public services on the Sabbaths throughout the year, he is under an obligation to read it thrice&#x2014;twice read the text and once in the Onkelos [Aramaic] version&#x2014;a verse left untranslated being read thrice&#x2014;and so he will conclude the weekly portions concurrently with the Congregation.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER XIV.</h1>
<p>1. In the morning service, in the additional service and in the <italic>Neilah</italic> (closing) service, the priests uplift their hands to pronounce the Priestly Benediction. This is not done in the afternoon service; for in the afternoon [on ordinary days] all have had their meals, and the priests may possibly have drunk wine, and an inebriate is forbidden to perform this rite. Nor even on a fast-day do they pronounce the Priestly Benediction, for fear that if permitted on such a day, the rule might be disregarded in the afternoon service on other days.</p>
<p>2. This rule applies to a fast-day on which both the afternoon and <italic>Neilah</italic> services are recited; for example, the Day of Atonement and a public fast-day (specially appointed). [It is different however with] a fast-day when there is no <italic>Neilah,</italic> for example, the Ninth of Ab or the Seventeenth of Tammuz. The reason is that the afternoon service, being recited on such a day near sunset, appears to have the character of <italic>Neilah</italic> and will not be confused with the afternoon service on other days. Hence the Priestly Benediction is pronounced on such a fast-day. A priest who transgressed the rule and went up in front of the ark on the Day of Atonement in the afternoon service is permitted to raise his hands to pronounce the Benediction&#x2014;as it is known that on this day there is no inebriety&#x2014;and he is not made to step down, so as not to give rise to the suspicion that he was disqualified and therefore had been made to step down.</p>
<p>3. How is this rite performed outside the Temple? When the Reader of the congregation reaches the paragraph in the <italic>Amidah</italic> referring to the restoration of the ancient service and he utters the first word of that blessing beginning &#x201C;Be pleased&#x201D;,<xref rid="fn47">&#x002A;</xref> all the priests in the synagogue leave their places, proceed to the platform in front of the ark, stand there, with their faces towards the ark and their backs towards the congregation, their fingers bent in their palms, till the Reader concludes the paragraph of thanksgiving.<xref rid="fn48">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> Then they turn their faces toward the congregation, straighten their fingers, raise their hands to a level with their shoulders and begin reciting, &#x201C;May the Lord bless thee&#x201D;. The Reader prompts them, word by word, and they repeat, as it is said, &#x201C;Say unto them&#x201D;, which means that they are to wait till he recites. When they have ended the first verse, all the people respond, &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;. The Reader of the congregation prompts them in the second verse, word for word, which they repeat till they have ended the second verse, when all the people respond, &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;. And so with the third verse.</p>
<p>4. When the priests have concluded reciting the three verses of the Benediction, the Reader begins the last paragraph of the <italic>Amidah,</italic> that beginning, &#x201C;Grant Peace&#x201D;. The priests turn their faces towards the ark, bend their fingers<xref rid="fn49">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> and remain standing on the platform till he concludes the paragraph, and then they return to their places.</p>
<p>5. The prompter may not summon the priests till the sound of the congregation&#x2019;s &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; to the previous blessing<xref rid="fn50">&#x002A;</xref> has ceased. The priests may not begin the introductory blessing, &#x201C;Who hath sanctified us with the sanctification of Aaron and commanded us to bless His people Israel with love&#x201D; till the sound of the prompter&#x2019;s summons to the priests has ceased. The congregation do not respond &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; till the sound of the priest&#x2019;s utterance of the first verse of the Benediction has ceased. The priests do not begin the second verse of the Benediction till the sound of the congregation&#x2019;s &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; has ceased. The Reader may not join in the congregational response &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; after the priests&#x2019; Benediction, lest he become confused and will not know which verse of the Benediction he has to prompt, whether the second or third.</p>
<p>6. The priests may not turn their faces away from the congregation till the Reader begins the paragraph commencing, &#x201C;Grant Peace&#x201D;. Nor may they bend their fingers till they have turned their faces away from the congregation. It is one of the ordinances instituted by Rabban [Yachanan ben Zaccai] that the priests do not ascend to the platform in front of the ark, wearing shoes, but they stand there barefoot.</p>
<p>7. While the priests bless the people, they may not look at the people, nor allow their minds to wander. Their eyes should look to the ground like one engaged in prayer. No one may gaze at the priests while they are blessing the people so that their attention should not be distracted. All the people should concentrate their minds, so as to hear the Benediction and turn their faces towards the faces of the priests, but they do not look at them.</p>
<p>8. If only one priest pronounces the Benediction, he begins to recite without being summoned. The congregational Reader prompts him, word for word, as stated. If there were two or more priests they do not begin to bless the people, till the Reader has summoned them with the formula, &#x201C;Priests&#x201D;. They respond, &#x201C;The Lord bless thee&#x201D;. He then prompts them, word for word, in the order stated.</p>
<p>9. How was the rite of the Priestly Benediction performed in the Temple? The priests went up to the platform after the conclusion of the morning sacrifice. They raised their hands, with fingers straightened, above their heads; except the High Priest who did not raise his hands higher than the Golden Plate.<xref rid="fn51">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> One prompted them, word for word, just as is done outside the temple, till they had concluded the three verses of the Benediction. The people did not respond &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; after each verse. But all the three verses were recited as one blessing. When they concluded, all the people responded, &#x201C;Blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting.&#x201D;</p>
<p>10. The name of God was pronounced as written; that is, the name of which the utterance is according to the letters <italic>Yod, He, Vav, He.</italic> This is the Ineffable Name (literally the Proper Name), wherever it is referred to. Outside the temple the usual pronunciation is used, as if it were written A.D.N.I.<xref rid="fn52">&#x002A;</xref>; for the Proper Name of God as written, is pronounced nowhere but in the Temple. After the death of Simon the Just, the priests ceased to utter the proper name of God in the Benediction, even in the Temple, so that an unworthy or unsuitable person should not learn it. The ancient teachers did not teach this name to their disciples or sons, even when they were worthy, except once in seven years&#x2014;all this out of respect to the Honored and Revered Name of God.</p>
<p>11. The Priestly Benediction, wherever it is recited, must be recited only in Hebrew, as it is said, &#x201C;Thus shall ye bless the Children of Israel.&#x201D; A tradition dating back to Moses is the authority for the following exposition: &#x201C;Thus shall ye bless&#x201D;, that means, standing. &#x201C;Thus shall ye bless&#x201D;, that means, with hands raised. &#x201C;Thus shall ye bless&#x201D;, that means, in the Holy Tongue. &#x201C;Thus shall ye bless&#x201D; that means, face to face with the congregation. &#x201C;Thus shall ye bless&#x201D;, that means uttering the Proper Name of God. This however is uttered thus, only when the Benediction is pronounced in the Temple, as already stated.</p>
<p>12. In no place may the priests add, either softly or aloud, a blessing to the three verses of the Benediction, such as, &#x201C;The Lord, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many more as you are&#x201D;, or other verses of a similar tenor, for it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not add to it&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 13:1). Every priest proceeding to the platform to pronounce the Benediction, as soon as he starts, says, &#x201C;May it be Thy Will, O Lord our God, that this Benediction which Thou hast commanded us to bless therewith Thy people Israel shall be a perfect blessing. May there be in it no stumbling nor perverseness from now and for evermore&#x201D;. Before the priest turns his face towards the people to bless them, he recites the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast sanctified us with the sanctification of Aaron and commanded us to bless Thy people Israel with love&#x201D;. He then turns his face to the congregation and begins to bless them. And when he turns his face away from the congregation, after he had concluded the Benediction, he says &#x201C;We have done that which Thou hast decreed unto us. Do Thou fulfill unto us that which Thou hast promised unto us. Do Thou look down from Thy holy habitation, from Heaven, and bless Thy People Israel&#x201D;.</p>
<p>13. When the priests turn their faces towards the people to bless them, and when they turn their faces away, after blessing them, they should always turn to the right. And so too, whenever any one turns, it should always be to the right.</p>
<p>14. The Priestly Benediction was pronounced in the Temple once every day, after the morning sacrifice had been offered up. The priests came and stood upon the steps of the Temple porch and blessed the people in the form we have stated. Outside the Temple, the Benediction was pronounced at the close of each service except that of the afternoon, as previously stated. The endeavour is everywhere made to secure an Israelite (one who is not a priest) as prompter; as it is said, &#x201C;Say unto them&#x201D;, which implies that the prompter is not to be one of them.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER XV.</h1>
<p>1. Six things prevent the performance of the rite of the Priestly Benediction: Defective speech; Physical blemishes; Transgressions; Wine; Age; Uncleanliness of the hands.</p>
<p>Defective speech: Sufferers from a defect in speech, who cannot utter the letters as they should be pronounced, who, for example, read <italic>Aleph</italic> as if it were <italic>Ayin,</italic> or vice versa, or <italic>Shibboleth</italic> as if it were <italic>Sibboleth,</italic> etc., do not perform the rite of the Priestly Benediction. So too, those who are heavy of tongue and whose utterance is thick so that they are not understood by all, do not perform this rite.</p>
<p>2. Physical blemishes: A priest who has blemishes on his face, hands or feet, as, for instance one whose fingers are twisted inwards or sideways, or whose hands are covered with tetters, does not perform this rite, as the people will stare at him. He who slavers, when speaking, or is blind of one eye, shall not perform this rite. If however, the person who is blind of one eye, or slavers is a well known and familiar figure in the town, he is permitted to perform the rite, as no one will stare at him. So too, a person whose hands are stained with indigo or other colouring material, shall not perform this rite. But if the majority of the residents in that town are engaged in the dyeing industry, he may do so, as they will not stare at him.</p>
<p>3. Transgressions: A priest who had slain a human being, even if he has repented, must not perform this rite, for it is said, &#x201C;Your hands are full of blood&#x201D; (Isaiah 1:15), and it is further written, &#x201C;And when ye spread forth your hands I will hide mine eyes from you&#x201D; (Isaiah 1:15). A priest who had worshiped idols, whether under compulsion or in error, even if he had repented, must never perform this rite, for it is said, &#x201C;Nevertheless, the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem&#x201D; (II Kings 23:9); and the Priestly Benediction is like the Temple service, as it is said, &#x201C;To minister unto Him and to bless in His name&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 10:8). So too, a priest who had become a convert to idolatry, though he returned to Judaism, never performs this rite. The commission of other transgressions is no disqualification.</p>
<p>4. Age: A priest who is a youth does not perform this rite till his beard has grown.</p>
<p>Wine: One who has drunk a fourth of a log<xref rid="fn53">&#x002A;</xref> of wine in one draught does not perform this rite till the effect of the wine has passed off&#x2014;the Priestly Benediction being analogous to the Temple service. If, however, he drank a fourth of a log of wine in two draughts, or diluted it with a little water, he is permitted to perform the rite. If he drank more than a quarter of a log, even mixed with water, and even if he drank it in several draughts, he must not perform the rite till the effect of the wine has passed off. How much is the fourth of a log? The contents of a vessel two finger breadths long, two finger breadths wide and two and seven-tenths finger breadths high. In all measurements throughout the Torah, the finger used is the thumb, called <italic>Bohen Yad.</italic></p>
<p>5. Uncleanliness of the hands: A priest who has not washed his hands must not perform this rite. But he first washes his hands as far as the wrists, just as the priests did in preparation for the Temple service and then he blesses the people, as it is said, &#x201C;Lift up your hands to the sanctuary&#x201D;,<xref rid="fn54">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> (Psalms 134:2). The profaned<xref rid="fn55">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> priest does not perform this rite because he has not the status of priesthood.</p>
<p>6. A priest who is free from any of these disqualifications, even though he is not a scholar nor punctilious in the observance of religious duties, and even though people talk about him and his dealings are not marked by strict integrity, nevertheless pronounces the Priestly Benediction and should not be prevented from performing the rite; since it is a duty incumbent on every qualified priest to bless the people, and we do not say to a wicked man, &#x201C;Be still more wicked and abstain from fulfilling religious duties.&#x201D;</p>
<p>7. Do not wonder and say, &#x201C;Of what use is the blessing of this ordinary person?&#x201D; The acceptance of the Benediction does not depend upon the priest but upon the Almighty, as it is said, &#x201C;So shall they put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them&#x201D; (Numbers 6:27). The priests fulfill their duty with which they have been charged, and the Almighty, in His mercy, blesses Israel according to His will.</p>
<p>8. The people in the rear of the priests are not included in the blessing. Those, however, who stand at their side are included. If there was a partition&#x2014;even if it were an iron wall&#x2014;between the priests and those that were being blessed, since their faces are turned toward those of the priests, they are included in the blessing.</p>
<p>9. The Benediction by the priests requires the presence of ten [male adult] Israelites, the priests being counted in the quorum. If the Congregation present in the synagogue consists wholly of priests, all of them perform the rite of pronouncing the Benediction. Whom are they blessing? Their brethren in the north and their brethren in the south. Who responds Amen to their blessings? The women and children. If, in addition to those who have gone up to the platform, there are ten priests present, these ten respond Amen, and the rest pronounce the Benediction.</p>
<p>10. In a congrgation where there is no other priest but the Reader, he does not perform the rite of the Priestly Benediction. But he may perform it if he is confident that after doing so, he will return to the reading of the service. In a congregation where there is no priest, the Reader, when he comes to the last paragraph, beginning, &#x201C;Grant peace&#x201D; first recites the following: &#x201C;Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the threefold blessing of Thy Law, written by the hand of Moses, Thy servant, which was spoken by the mouth of Aaron and his sons, the priests, Thy holy people, as it is said, &#x2018;The Lord bless thee and keep thee: The Lord make His face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn His face unto thee and give thee peace. So shall they put my name upon the children of Israel and I will bless them&#x2019; &#x201D;. The people do not respond Amen. He then begins the paragraph, &#x201C;Grant peace etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>11. A priest who, after performing the rite in one synagogue, went to another synagogue and found that the congregation was at prayers, but had not yet reached the Priestly Benediction, repeats the rite. And he may do so several times in the day. A priest who had not moved from his place to go up to the platform while the reader was reciting the paragraph beginning, &#x201C;Be pleased with the service of Thy people etc.&#x201D;, may not go up during that service. But if he had moved to go up to the platform, even though he had not reached it till this paragraph was concluded, he goes up and blesses the people.</p>
<p>12. The priest who does not go up to the platform to bless the people, although he has neglected to fulfill one affirmative precept, is accounted as having transgressed three affirmative precepts, for it is said, &#x201C;On this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel&#x201D;; &#x201C;Ye shall say unto them&#x201D;; &#x201C;So shall they put my name&#x201D; (Numbers 6:22-27). Any priest who does not bless the people is not blessed. Every priest who blesses them is blessed, for it is said, &#x201C;I will bless them that bless thee&#x201D; (Genesis 12:3). Blessed be the All-Merciful who hath helped us.</p>
<ftnote id="fn2">&#x002A;He knows the blessing correctly.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn3">&#x002A;According to another reading, &#x201C;Let them that go astray [learn to] judge according to the [true] knowledge of Thee.&#x201D; (Rashi quoting Halachoth Gedoloth) Rabbenu Jonah renders, &#x201C;Let them that go astray be judged according to Thy knowledge.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn4">&#x002A;In the German and Polish ritual, &#x201C;Inscribe in the book of life, all the sons of Thy Covenant.&#x201D;</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn5">&#x002A;&#x002A;The Geonim were heads of religious academies in Babylon.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn15">&#x002A;These sentences are no longer said.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn16">&#x002A;&#x002A;Contrary to their function.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn17">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;A woman omits this blessing and substitutes as follows: &#x201C;&#x2026; Who hast made me according to Thy will&#x201D;.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn23">&#x002A;Isaiah 6:3; Ezekiel 3:12; Psalms 146:10.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn24">&#x002A;This verse is not recited before the afternoon service but before the evening service both in the German and Spanish rituals.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn25">&#x002A;&#x002A;In ancient times the Synagogues were outside the towns and villages. The evening prayer during the working days was recited by everyone at home. On Friday evening they repaired to the communal place of worship. It would have been dangerous for a late comer, left in the synagogue, to go home in the dark alone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn26">&#x002A;Beginning: &#x201C;And a Redeemer shall come to Zion &#x2026; and Thou art holy.&#x201D;</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn31">&#x002A;Elevated platform with a desk on which the Scroll of the Law is placed for public reading.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn32">&#x002A;According to the German and Polish ritual, on the other Scriptural fast-days, at the afternoon service.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn33">&#x002A;&#x002A;<italic>Literally</italic> &#x201C;Who hath chosen us from all peoples and given us His Law.&#x201D; God is addressed in the second person, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God because of our consciousness of His existence and attributes&#x2014;Justice, Kindness, Wisdom and Goodness. The Blessing continues in the third person Who <italic>hath</italic> chosen us, because His essence is unknown.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn34">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;<italic>Literally</italic>: &#x201C;Who hath given us the Law&#x201D; &#x201C;Who giveth the Law&#x201D; in the 3rd person.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn38">&#x002A;The Ashkenazi practice is to say these before <italic>Neilah</italic> on the Day of Atonement to mark the distinction between that service and the preceding service.</ftnote>

<ftnote id="fn40">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;Towards himself, if he holds and rolls the scroll, himself. If one sits, holding the scroll and another standing before him rolls the scroll, he should roll it inwards, so that the written part shall not be exposed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn41">&#x2020;The knot of the band which is wound round the scroll is placed inside the scroll so that the scroll should not have to be turned on its face to undo the knot.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn42">&#x2021;So that if the outside sheet of the scroll weakens, the seams connecting one sheet with another would come apart and the scroll would not be torn.</ftnote>

<chapter>
<title>Laws Concerning Phylacteries, the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> and the Scroll of the Law.</title>
<p>&#x2014;These comprise five affirmative precepts; namely, 1) to wear <italic>Tephillin</italic> (phylacteries) and put one on the head and 2) bind another on the arm; 3) to fix the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> on the doors of the gates; 4) that everyone should write a scroll of the Law for himself; 5) that the king should write a second scroll for himself, so that he may have two scrolls of the Law. The exposition of all these precepts is given in the following Chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>1. The four Pentateuchal sections, beginning respectively, &#x201C;Sanctify unto me&#x201D; (Ex. 13:1-10), &#x201C;And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee&#x201D; (Exodus 13:11-16)&#x2014;these two being in the Book of Exodus, &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) &#x201C;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), are written and covered with a skin. These are called <italic>Tephillin,</italic> and are placed upon the head and bound on the arm. The omission of the point of a single letter in any one of these sections bars, according to Scriptural enactment, the use of all of them. They must all be written perfectly and in accordance with rule.</p>
<p>2. This is the case also with the two sections of the <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> beginning respectively, &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:4-9) and &#x201C;And it shall come to pass if ye shall hearken diligently (Deuteronomy 11:13-21). If the point of a letter is missing in these two sections, the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> may not, according to Scriptural enactment, be used. The two sections must be written perfectly. So too, a scroll of the Law, in which a single letter is missing, is unfit for use.</p>
<p>3. There are ten points in regard to <italic>Tephillin</italic> (phylacteries). The observance of each is enjoined by a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. The neglect of any of them is an absolute bar to the use of the <italic>Tephillin.</italic> Hence, if there was a variation in any one of them, the <italic>Tephillin</italic> are unfit for use. Two of these have reference to the writing; eight, to the covering and the tying of the straps. The two points to be observed in the writing are that the sections must be written with ink, and must be written on parchment.</p>
<p>4. How is the ink prepared? Soot of oils or of pitch, wax or similar substance is collected; kneaded with gum of trees and a little honey; thoroughly wetted and pounded till it is like wafers. It is then stored away. When the scribe wishes to write, he soaks it in water in which gall-apples or similar substances have been steeped, and with this fluid he writes. Such writing when erased leaves no mark. This is the best way to write scrolls of the Law, <italic>Tephillin</italic> and <italic>Mezuzahs.</italic> If the scribe has written with fluid of the gall-oak or of caper,<xref rid="fn56">&#x002A;</xref> since the writing stays and is not rubbed out, scrolls of the Law, <italic>Tephillin</italic> or <italic>Mezuzahs</italic> so written are fit for use.</p>
<p>5. This being so, what is excluded by the Halacha, dating back to Moses, which ordains that these must be written with ink? It excludes pigments of other colors, such as red or green, etc.; so that if even a single letter in a scroll of the Law, <italic>Tephillin</italic> or <italic>Mezuzah</italic> was written with pigment of any other color [but black] or with gold, such a Scroll, <italic>Tephillin</italic> or <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is unfit for use.</p>
<p>6. There are three kinds of parchment, <italic>Gewil, Kelaf</italic> and <italic>Duxustus.</italic> How are these made? A hide of domestic cattle or wild beast is taken. First, its hair is removed. It is then pickled in salt, afterwards prepared with flour and subsequently tanned with gall-wood or similar materials which contract the pores of the hide and make it durable. And this it is that is called <italic>Gewil</italic> (parchment of whole-hide leather).</p>
<p>7. If, after removing the hair, the hide had been split through its thickness into two parts, so as to make of it two skins, one thin, namely that which had been next to the hair; the other thick, namely that which had been next to the flesh, and if these were prepared first with salt, then with flour and afterwards with gall-wood or similar substance the skin which had been next to the hair is called <italic>Kelaf</italic> (&#x003D; outer-skin parchment), and that which had been next to the flesh is called <italic>Duxustus</italic> (inner-skin parchment).</p>
<p>8. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that the scroll of the Law should be written on <italic>Gewil</italic> (whole hide parchment), and the writing should be on the side which had been next to the hair. The <italic>Tephillin</italic> should be written on <italic>Kelaf</italic> (the exterior part of the split hide) and the writing should be on the side which had been nearer the flesh; and the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> should be written on <italic>Duxustus</italic> (made of the inner part of the split hide), on the side which had been nearer the hair. If, on a <italic>Kelaf,</italic> one writes on the side that had been next to the hair, or, on a <italic>Gewil or Duxustus,</italic> one writes on the side that had been next to the flesh, the Scroll, <italic>Tephillin</italic> or <italic>Mezuzah</italic> so written is unfit for use.</p>
<p>9. Though this is the rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai, yet if one writes a scroll of the Law on parchment made from the exterior half of a split hide it is fit for use. The reason why a complete hide is mentioned is in order to exclude that made from the inner half of the split hide. If one wrote on it a scroll of the Law, it is unfit for use. So also, if one wrote a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> on the external half of a split hide or on an undivided hide, the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is fit for use. The inner half of a split hide is recommended to be used, only as a <italic>Mitzvah</italic> (specially approved).</p>
<p>10. Scrolls, <italic>Tephillin,</italic> and <italic>Mezuzahs</italic> are not written on the hide of a domestic or wild beast that is unclean or on the skin of an unclean bird. They are written on the hides of domestic or wild beasts that are clean or on the skins of clean birds, even when the flesh of these animals may not be eaten owing to their not having been slaughtered according to the ritual or being found to have suffered from a lesion of a mortal character. Nor are Scrolls, <italic>Tephillin</italic> and <italic>Mezuzahs</italic> written on the skin of a fish, even if it be of a clean species, because of its foulness. For this is not removed by tanning.</p>
<p>11. The undivided skin for a scroll of the Law, and the external half of the hide to be used for <italic>Tephillin</italic> or for a scroll of the Law must be tanned for their specific purposes. If they were not expressly so tanned, they are not fit for use. Accordingly, if a non-Israelite or a Samaritan tanned them, they are unfit for use. Even if the Samaritan was instructed to tan a particular hide for the purpose of its being used for a scroll of the Law or <italic>Tephillin,</italic> it is unfit for use; since he works with his own purposes in mind, not with those of his employer. Hence, anything that has to be done with a purpose in mind, if done by a Samaritan, is unfit for use. The skin for a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> does not require to be tanned for that express purpose.</p>
<p>12. It is a rule dating back to Moses who received it on Sinai that a scroll of the Law or <italic>Mezuzah</italic> may only be written on parchment that is ruled. Phylacteries need not be ruled, because they are covered. So too, phylacteries and a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> may be written from memory, as these sections are recited by and are familiar to everyone. But not a single letter may be written in a scroll of the Law, except from a written copy of the text.</p>
<p>13. A scroll of the Law, <italic>Tephillin,</italic> or <italic>Mezuzoth</italic> written by a heretic must be burnt. If written by a Samaritan, by a Jew converted to another faith, by one who surrenders Israelites to tyrants, by a slave, woman or minor, they are unfit for use, and must be hidden; for it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt bind them&#x201D;, &#x201C;And thou shalt write them&#x201D;. The implication is that only that person is qualified to write them, who is charged with the duty of putting on <italic>Tephillin</italic> and believes in the obligation. If they are found in the possession of a heretic, and it is not known who wrote them, they should be hidden. If found in the possession of a Samaritan or non-Israelite, they are fit to be used. Scrolls of the Law, <italic>Tephillin</italic> and <italic>Mezuzoth</italic> are not to be bought from non-Israelites for more than their value, so as not to accustom the latter to steal these holy articles or take them by force.</p>
<p>14. A scroll of the Law, phylacteries or <italic>Mezuzoth,</italic> written on the skin of a beast or bird&#x2014;whether domestic or wild&#x2014;which belongs to an unclean species, or written on skins that have not been tanned, and likewise a scroll of the Law or phylacteries written on skins not expressly tanned for those purposes, are unfit for use.</p>
<p>15. If one who writes a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> had not concentrated his mind while writing, and wrote one of the Names of God without express intent, these articles are unfit for use. Accordingly, when one is writing the name of God, even if an Israelite king greets him, he must not return the greeting. If he is writing two or three names of God, he may pause between writing one and writing the others and may respond.</p>
<p>16. After dipping the pen in ink to write the Name of God, the scribe does not start with a letter of the name but with a letter of the previous word. If he altogether forgot to write the name of God, he writes it above the line. But to write part of the name on the line and part above the line makes the scroll unfit for use. Other words that the scribe forgot to write may be written partly on the line and partly above it. These rules apply to a scroll of the Law. But in a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> or in phylacteries not a letter may be written above the line. If the scribe forgot even one letter, he must hide what he wrote and write a fresh slip. In all of them (Scrolls of the Law, <italic>Mezuzoth</italic> and Phylacteries) it is permissible to write the name of God upon a surface from which writing has been erased or obliterated.</p>
<p>17. Scribes of scrolls, phylacteries and <italic>Mezuzoth</italic> are forbidden to turn over the parchment sheet with its written surface beneath touching the board on which it lies, but should cover it with a cloth or fold it.</p>
<p>18. If, after a scroll of the Law, phylacteries or a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> had passed out of the scribe&#x2019;s hands, he makes the statement, &#x201C;I did not write the name of God in them with that purpose distinctly in mind&#x201D;, he is not believed to the extent of rendering them unfit for use, but his statement is accepted so far that he forfeits his entire remuneration. The reason why he is not believed so as to render them unfit for use is because his motive may possibly have been to cause a loss to the person who bought or hired them. It would seem however that his statement would only cause him to forfeit that quota of remuneration to which the writing of the names of God would entitle him. Hence, if he stated, &#x201C;the skins of this scroll of the Law or of these phylacteries were not expressly tanned for those purposes&#x201D;, then since in such a case he is believed so fully that he forfeits the whole of his remuneration, his statement is also credited so as to disqualify the articles from being used&#x2014;it being a matter of general knowledge that if the skins had not been expressly tanned for the purpose of being made into phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, the scribe receives no remuneration whatsoever.</p>
<p>19. Phylacteries and <italic>Mezuzoth</italic> may only be written in square Hebrew script. Permission was also given to write scrolls of the Law in Greek characters but not in those of any other foreign tongue. The ancient Greek script has gone out of use, been corrupted and become obsolete. Hence, at the present day, all three religious articles,&#x2014;Scroll of the Law, Tephillin and Mezuzah,&#x2014;are only written in the square Hebrew script. Care must be taken in writing that no letter shall adhere to any other letter; for any letter which is not completely surrounded on all four sides by a blank space of parchment has been improperly written. Any letter that cannot be read by a child of ordinary intelligence&#x2014;not particularly bright or dull&#x2014;is improperly written. Thus a <italic>Yod</italic> must not be like a <italic>Vav</italic> nor a <italic>Vav</italic> like a <italic>Yod,</italic> nor a <italic>Koph</italic> like a <italic>Beth,</italic> nor a <italic>Beth</italic> like a <italic>Koph,</italic> nor a <italic>Daleth</italic> like a <italic>Resh,</italic> nor a <italic>Resh</italic> like a <italic>Daleth,</italic> etc., so that the reader may be able to read fluently.</p>
<p>20. If the parchment was perforated, the scribe must not write on the perforation. A perforation over which the ink passes is not regarded as a perforation, and it is permitted to write across it. Hence, it is permitted to write on the skin of a bird that has been tanned. Should the parchment have become perforated, after it has been written on, if the perforation is in the interior of a letter, as, for example, in a <italic>H&#x00E9;</italic> or <italic>Mem,</italic> etc., it is regarded as properly written. Should one of the sides of a letter have been perforated, so that the letter is divided&#x2014;then the rule is that if there is left of the part that is unperforated as much as would form a small letter, it is regarded as properly written, provided that it does not resemble a different letter. If the part that is left unperforated is not as much as would form a small letter, it is not regarded as properly written.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. How are the sections in the phylactery that is placed on the head to be written? The four sections are respectively written on four separate slips of parchment; each slip is rolled up separately and they are then placed in four compartments composed of one skin. As to the phylactery placed on the arm, these four sections are written in four columns on one slip of parchment. This slip is rolled up like a scroll of the Law from the last column to the first and is placed in one [leather] compartment.</p>
<p>2. The scribe must exercise care in writing these sections, for if he wrote a closed section as an open one,<xref rid="fn57">&#x002A;</xref> or wrote an open section as if it were closed, the slip is unfit for use. The first three sections are, all of them, open. The last section, that beginning, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken diligently&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is closed.</p>
<p>3. He must exercise care in regard to the words that are <italic>plene</italic> or <italic>defective</italic>,<xref rid="fn58">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> that all the four sections should be written as they are in an examined scroll of the Law. For if he wrote a word <italic>plene</italic> that should have been written <italic>defective,</italic> the slip is unfit for use till the superfluous letter has been obliterated. If a word that is <italic>plene</italic> has been written <italic>defective,</italic> the slip is unfit for use and cannot be made good. The following is the list of the words in these four sections that are <italic>plene</italic> and <italic>defective</italic> respectively.</p>
<p>[<italic>For paragraphs 4, 5, 6 and 7 (lists of</italic> plene <italic>and</italic> defective <italic>words), see the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 121b and 122a</italic>.]</p>
<p>6. The <italic>Ayin</italic> of Shema and <italic>Daleth</italic> of <italic>Echad</italic> (Deuteronomy 6:4) are to be written in larger type.</p>
<p>8. He must pay attention to the &#x201C;crowns&#x201D; (tittles) above the letters. These are like an upright <italic>Zayin</italic> and are placed on each letter to which such a crown belongs as written in the scroll of the Law. The following are the letters in the four sections thus ornamented:</p>
<p>9. In the first section, there is only one such letter, namely the closed <italic>Mem</italic> in Meeyamim which has over it three <italic>Zain</italic>-shaped lines. In the second section, there are five letters, each of them a <italic>H&#x00E9;;</italic> and on each, there are four <italic>zain</italic>-shaped lines. These are the <italic>H&#x00E9;</italic> in Unesanah; the first and the last <italic>H&#x00E9;</italic> in Hikshah; the <italic>H&#x00E9;</italic> in Vayaharog; the <italic>H&#x00E9;</italic> in Yadchah.</p>
<p>10. The third section has five such letters. The <italic>Koof</italic> in Uvekoomecha has over it three <italic>zain</italic>-shaped lines; the <italic>Koof</italic> in Ukeshartam has over it three <italic>zain</italic>-shaped lines; the two letters <italic>Teth,</italic> and the letter <italic>P&#x00E9;</italic> in Letotaphoth have on each of them four <italic>zain</italic>-shaped lines.</p>
<p>11. The fourth section has five such letters. The <italic>P&#x00E9;</italic> of Veasaphta has above it three <italic>zain</italic>-shaped lines. The <italic>Tav</italic> of Veasaphta has one <italic>zain</italic>-shaped line. The two letters <italic>Teth</italic> and the letter <italic>P&#x00E9;</italic> in Letotaphoth have on each of them four <italic>zain</italic>-shaped lines. Altogether, the letters thus ornamented are sixteen. If the scribe wholly omitted these ornaments, added to them or omitted them over some of the letters, he has not rendered the phylacteries unfit for use.</p>
<p>12. If one buys phylacteries from one who is not a recognized expert, he has to examine them. If he bought from him one hundred parchment slips, he examines three slips, either two of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the arm or two slips of those in the phylacteries worn on the arm and one of the slips of the phylacteries worn on the head. If he found all these three correct, a presumption is established in the vendor&#x2019;s favour, and all his phylacteries are fit for use and the rest need not be examined. If he bought them however in several bundles, this examination (of three slips) must take place in each bundle, there being a presumption that the several bundles came from different individuals.</p>
<p>13. A man who wrote phylacteries with his own hand or purchased them from an expert or, having bought them of a non-expert, examined them and replaced them in their leather containers, need never re-examine them, even after the lapse of many years. As long as the leather container remains sound, the presumption that they are sound holds good. Nor is it apprehended that a letter has been obliterated or perforated. Hillel the Elder was wont to say, &#x201C;These phylacteries belonged to my mother&#x2019;s father.&#x201D;</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. There are eight rules for the making of phylacteries; all of them are traditionally ascribed to Moses who received them on Sinai; hence the observance of all of them is indispensable. A variation from any of them renders the phylacteries unfit for use. The rules are as follows: The phylacteries (that is, the external leather containers) must be square; they are to be sewn in such a way as to retain the square shape; their diagonals must be those of a square so that all the angles shall be equal; the leather container of the phylactery for the head shall have the letter <italic>Shin</italic> embossed on the right and on the left side; each of the slips of parchment on which the sections from the Pentateuch are written is to be wrapt in a cover; this is to be tied with hair, and then the slips are placed in their respective compartments which are sewn up with sinews; a border with a fold open at both ends shall be made of the skin of the base for the strap to pass through freely; the straps shall be black, and have the special knot, that is known to all, in the shape of a <italic>Daleth.</italic></p>
<p>2. How is the phylactery for the head made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length, breadth and height. It is of no consequence however if the height is more than the breadth or less. What is essential is that the length and breadth shall be equal. Three grooves are cut in the block so that it is divided into four parts as in this figure <img src="images/Art_P1.jpg" alt="art" />. A piece of leather is taken and soaked in water. The wooden block is put in it and the leather is inserted into each groove. While it is still damp, it is crinkled on both sides, to make a shape of the letter <italic>Shin</italic> with three lines on the right side of the wearer and with four lines on the left side.</p>
<p>3. The leather is left on the wood till it dries; it is then slipped off from the wooden block, with the result that it has the shape of four compartments. The prescribed sections of Scripture written on slips of parchment are placed, one in each compartment. A portion of the leather is drawn round and beneath the cube (to form its base). This is sewn up at its four sides. A portion is left in this skin at the base for the strap to pass through as in a loop. This it is which is called the bridge.</p>
<p>4. How are the phylacteries for the arm made? A rectangular block of wood is taken, which is equal in length and breadth. It is to be a finger-breadth in height, or a little more or less. The block is covered with wet leather which is left on till it dries. It is then removed, and in the place where the wood had been, a single slip of parchment on which the four prescribed sections of Scripture are written, is inserted. A portion of the leather is drawn round below and is sewn up at its four sides. Of this base a part is left to form a loop for the strap to pass through.</p>
<p>5. What is the order in which the sections are placed in the phylactery for the head? The last section, that beginning, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass if ye will hearken diligently&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 11:13) is placed in the first compartment, to the right of the wearer; the section beginning, &#x201C;Hear O Israel&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:4) in the compartment adjacent to it; the section beginning, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God will bring thee&#x201D; (Exodus 13:11), next to the one containing the section, &#x201C;Hear O Israel&#x201D;, and the section beginning, &#x201C;Sanctify unto me every first born&#x201D; (Exodus 13:1) in the fourth compartment which would be to the left of the wearer of the phylactery; so that anyone facing the wearer and reading what is before him would read the sections in the right Scriptural order as in the annexed figure. If there<xref rid="fn59">&#x002A;</xref> was a deviation from this order, the phylacteries are not fit for use.</p>
<p>6. The sections for the phylactery for the arm are written in four columns on one long strip of parchment like a scroll of the Law, and in the order in which they are found in the Pentateuch as in the annexed figure.<xref rid="fn60">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> If the scribe wrote them on four separate slips and placed them in one compartment, he has done what is required, and need not attach them to each other.</p>
<p>7. When he rolls up the parchment slips containing the sections, for the phylacteries worn on the head or on the arm, he rolls them from the end to the beginning so that, if opened, each section can be read from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p>8. When the slips are about to be placed in their respective compartments, they are wrapped in a cloth, over which they are fastened with hair. They are then deposited in their compartments. This hair must be that of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species; and may even be taken from animals which are <italic>Nevelah</italic><xref rid="fn61">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> or <italic>Terefah</italic>.<xref rid="fn62">&#x2020;</xref> The custom that has come into general use is to fasten the slips with hair taken from calves&#x2019; tails.</p>
<p>9. The leather receptacles of the phylacteries are only sewn with sinews of a domestic or wild beast of the clean species, and may be taken from animals of such species even if they are <italic>Nevelah</italic><xref rid="fn63">&#x002A;</xref> or <italic>Terefah</italic>.<xref rid="fn64">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> The sinews used are those found in the heel of the domestic or wild beast, which are white and tough. They are softened by pounding them with stones or similar substances, till they become like flax. They are spun and twined, and then used for sewing the phylacteries and the sheets of the scrolls of the Law.</p>
<p>10. The receptacles are to be sewn in such a way as to preserve the square contour of the base. It is a broadly established rule that on each side, there are to be three stitches, making altogether twelve stitches, whether the phylactery is for the arm or for the head. If the scribe desires to make ten or fourteen stitches, he may do so. The stitch must pass through the leather on both sides.</p>
<p>11. The grooves of the phylacteries for the head ought to extend to the base where the stitching is done. If the grooves are recognizable so that the four divisions clearly appear, the phylacteries are fit for use, even though the grooves do not extend to the base. If however the grooves are not recognizable, the phylacteries are unfit for use. Within each groove, above the leather, a thread or cord ought to be passed so as to separate the compartments from each other. The general custom is to draw through each of the three grooves a sinew of the same kind as those used for the stitches.</p>
<p>12. How are the thongs fixed? A strip of leather is taken as wide as the length of a barley corn. If wider, it is fit for use. The length of the strap of the phylactery for the head should be sufficient to encircle the head, form the knot and leave enough for the straps on either side to reach to the navel or a little higher. The strap for the phylactery of the arm should be sufficiently long to encircle the forearm, form the knot, extend down to the middle finger, about which it is to be wound three times and then fastened. If the straps exceed in length the foregoing dimensions, they are also fit for use.</p>
<p>13. The thong of the phylactery for the head is inserted in the loop open at both ends. It is measured to fit the wearer&#x2019;s head, and then tied in a rectangular knot like a <italic>Daleth.</italic> This knot, every scholar should learn how to make. It is impossible to teach its form by description; this can only be taught by ocular demonstration. In the case of the phylactery for the arm, the thong is tied in a knot in the shape of a <italic>Yod.</italic> The thong of the phylactery for the arm should move freely in the loop, so that the wearer can loosen or tighten it when he puts it on his arm.</p>
<p>14. The thongs of the phylacteries, whether for the head or for the arm, must have their exterior surface black. This is a rule that goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. But the other side of the thongs, being close to the skin, are fit for use if they are green or white. They must not however be red, for if the thong were inadvertently turned, the color of its lower surface would subject the wearer to ignominy. The lower side of the thongs should not be otherwise in color than the base of the leather case containing the parchment slips. If the latter is green, the former should be green; if white, the former should be white. It is comely if the phylacteries are wholly black, namely, both the case containing the slips of parchment and the thongs.</p>
<p>15. The leather which forms the receptacles of the phylacteries and its thongs is to be made from the hide of a domestic or wild quadruped or skin of a fowl that belongs to the clean species, and may even be taken from those of these species that are <italic>Nevelah</italic> and <italic>Terefah.</italic> If they were made of the skin or hide of unclean species, or if the phylacteries were covered with gold, the phylacteries are unfit for use. The leather for the thongs must be expressly tanned for their intended purpose to be thongs of phylacteries. The leather which forms the receptacles for the phylacteries need not be tanned. Even if it consists of raw hide it is fit for use. Many places have the custom to make them of raw hide.</p>
<p>16. The receptacles of the phylacteries may not be prepared by any one but an Israelite; for the making of these is like the writing of the prescribed sections because of the letter <italic>Shin</italic> which is embossed on the phylactery for the head, as we have already stated. Hence, if a non-Israelite made or sewed the phylacteries, they are unfit for use. So too, whoever is disqualified from writing the prescribed sections for the phylacteries may not prepare them.</p>
<p>17. The phylactery for the head may not be transformed into a phylactery for the arm, but the latter may be changed into the former; on the principle that an object may not be degraded from a higher to a lower sacred use. So too, the thong of the phylactery for the head may not be transferred to a phylactery for the arm. This rule only applies to phylacteries that had been worn. But with regard to phylacteries for the head that no one had ever worn, if it is desired to transform them into phylacteries for the arm, this may be done. How is this effected? It is covered with leather so that it appears as one receptacle. The phylactery may then be bound on the arm.</p>
<p>18. In case the stitches of the phylacteries are broken, they become unfit for use if there are two broken stitches adjacent to each other, or three not adjacent. This rule applies to old phylacteries. New phylacteries are fit for use as long as they keep their surface unimpaired. The following would be called new. If, at the place where the stitches have given way, part of the leather is held in the hand so that the phylactery is suspended, and the leather is strong enough not to be further torn, such phylacteries would be regarded as new. If however the leather is not strong enough to bear the weight of the phylacteries so suspended, but would tear, such phylacteries are regarded as old.</p>
<p>19. A thong that has become broken is not to be tied together nor sewn up; but it is to be removed, put away, and replaced by a new thong. The parts of the broken thong are unfit for use unless the length and breadth of the part is of the prescribed dimension or larger. Care should always be taken that the external surface of the thongs should be above, when the phylacteries are bound on the hand or round the head. End of the chapter.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. Where is the phylactery of the head placed? It is placed on that part of the crown of the head, where the hair adjacent to the forehead ends, and this is the place where an infant&#x2019;s brain pulsates (the fontanelle). The phylactery needs to be adjusted so that it lies in the centre of the forehead, in a line with the point between the eyes. The knot should be at the top of the back of the neck, which is the end of the skull.</p>
<p>2. The phylactery of the hand is bound on the left arm over the biceps muscle which is the flesh that stands out on the upper arm that is intermediate between the shoulder-blade and forearm, so that when the upper arm is held close to the ribs, the phylactery will be opposite the heart and thus the precept will be fulfilled, &#x201C;And these words &#x2026; shall be upon thine heart&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:6).</p>
<p>3. To lay the phylactery of the hand on the palm or that of the head on the forehead is the practice of the Sadducees. He who makes the phylactery round like a nut is not fulfilling the precept in any way. A left-handed person lays the phylactery on his right arm, used by him as his left. If one is ambidextrous, he lays it on his left arm, which is the same as the left arm of any other person. The places where the phylacteries are respectively bound and laid are known by tradition.</p>
<p>4. The lack of a phylactery for the head does not preclude one from putting on that of the hand, nor does the lack of a phylactery of the hand preclude one from putting on that for the head. Each is a duty separate and independent. What blessings are recited? For the phylactery of the head, the formula is as follows: &#x201C;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and given us a command concerning the precept of phylacteries&#x201D;. For that of the hand, the form is as follows: &#x201C;Who hath sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to lay the phylacteries&#x201D;.</p>
<p>5. This rule applies to the case where a person puts on one phylactery only. But when one lays both phylacteries, he recites one blessing, namely, the form, &#x201C;And hast commanded us to lay the phylacteries&#x201D;, binds the phylactery on his arm, and then puts on that for the head. When they are removed, that on the head is removed first, and afterwards that on the arm.</p>
<p>6. When a person has recited the blessing, &#x201C;Who hast commanded us to lay phylacteries&#x201D;, and bound the phylactery on his arm, he is forbidden to converse, even to the extent of acknowledging his master&#x2019;s greeting, till he has put on the phylactery of the head. If he conversed he has committed a transgression; and when putting on the phylactery for the head, he must recite another blessing, viz: the form, &#x201C;Who hast given us a command concerning the precept of the phylacteries&#x201D;, and then he puts on the phylactery for the head.</p>
<p>7. On each occasion when one puts on phylacteries, the blessing is recited, even if they are removed and put on again several times in the day. It is a universal rule with regard to religious precepts that the appropriate blessings are recited prior to their performance. Hence too, the blessing for the phylactery of the hand has to be recited after it is placed on the biceps muscle before the thong is tightened, for the fastening constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.</p>
<p>8. When a person removes his phylacteries, and puts them in a bag, he should not place the phylactery of the hand beneath and that for the head above it, because when he will again have occasion to put them on, he will come into contact with the phylactery of the head first, will thus be under the necessity of putting it down and take out the phylactery of the hand, the former not being put on before the latter. It is forbidden to leave a precept and pass on to the fulfillment of another religious duty, the rule being that the duty that first presents itself should first engage our attention. Hence, the phylactery for the hand should be placed above so that one may come into contact with it first, and the phylacteries be put on in the right order.</p>
<p>9. A bag expressly intended to contain phylacteries and into which these have been placed, becomes consecrated and may not be put to secular use. If the bag was intended for this express purpose of containing phylacteries but had never contained them, or if phylacteries had been casually placed in a bag not set aside for that use, it does not become sacred, and continues to be a secular object as it had been hitherto. Phylacteries may not be suspended by their thong or by the part which contains the scriptural section. But the bag containing the phylacteries may be suspended.</p>
<p>10. The proper time for putting on phylacteries is when it is day and not when it is night, for it is said, &#x201C;Day by day&#x201D;<xref rid="fn65">&#x002A;</xref> (Exodus 13:10). &#x201C;The ordinance&#x201D; mentioned in this verse refers to the precept of phylacteries. So it is said, &#x201C;And it shall be for a sign&#x201D;, while Sabbaths and festivals are them-also, Sabbaths and festivals are not seasons for putting on phylacteries, for selves a sign. When is the proper time in the day to put on phylacteries? At the hour when a person can see his neighbour at a distance of four cubits and recognize him. The period extends till sunset.</p>
<p>11. A person who put on phylacteries before sunset, is permitted when it becomes dusk, to continue to wear them, even throughout the night. The multitude however is not to be so taught. Everyone should be instructed not to wear phylacteries at night, but to remove them at sunset. Whoever deliberately puts on phylacteries after sunset, violates a prohibition, for it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt keep this ordinance in its season, day by day&#x201D; (Exodus 13:10).</p>
<p>12. If the sun sets while a man with the phylacteries on his head was on the road, he places his hand upon the phylactery till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If Sabbath or a festival arrived while he was sitting in the house of study, with the phylactery on his head, he places his hand upon it till he reaches home when he removes the phylactery. If there is a house near the City Wall,<xref rid="fn66">&#x002A;</xref> where the phylacteries could be safely left, he should leave them there. If he did not remove them after sunset, because he had no place where they would be safe, and he kept them on for the sake of security, his conduct is lawful.</p>
<p>13. One who is exempt from reading the <italic>Shema</italic> is exempt from putting on phylacteries. If a child less than thirteen years of age knows how to take care of his phylacteries, his father purchases a set for him, so as to train him in the practice of religious precepts. Those who suffer intestinal troubles or have difficulty in controlling their sphincters are exempt from the obligation of putting on phylacteries. All who are ritually unclean are under the same obligation of putting on phylacteries as those who are ritually clean. One, who is in pain or whose mind is not calm and composed is exempt from the duty of putting on phylacteries; for the wearer must not allow his consciousness of them to wander. Priests while engaged in the temple service, Levites during the recital of hymns in their appointed places, Israelites while they are in the Sanctuary, are exempt from the duties of reciting the prayers and putting on phylacteries.</p>
<p>14. As long as one is wearing phylacteries, he should frequently touch them with his fingers, so as not to lose consciousness of them for a single moment. For their degree of sanctity is higher than that of the golden plate which the High Priest wore on his forehead. On the latter, the name of God was engraved once only, while the phylactery for the head contains the tetragrammaton twenty-one times, and the phylactery for the arm, an equal number of times.</p>
<p>15. A requisite in wearing phylacteries is physical cleanliness. One should take care that no flatus escapes him while he has them on. Hence, he may not, while wearing them, indulge in regular sleep or even doze. But if they are covered with a cloth, he may doze, even while wearing them. How so? He places his head between his knees and dozes in a sitting posture. If his phylacteries were folded and held in his hand, the holder may even sleep in the regular way.</p>
<p>16. No meal, unless it be of a casual character, may be eaten, while one wears phylacteries (without previous preparation). Before proceeding to a regular meal, he removes them, places them on the table, washes his hands, puts them on again, recites the blessing for food while he has them on.</p>
<p>17. If one feels a call of nature while wearing phylacteries, he is not to deposit them, before entering the lavatory, in the crevices that open towards the public thoroughfare, lest passers-by may take them. How should he act? Even if he needs to relieve the bladder while he is at a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, he should remove the phylacteries, roll them up in his garment, as a scroll is rolled up, grasp them in his right hand opposite his heart, taking care that not a thong projects outside his hand as much as a hand breadth; then he enters, relieves himself, and, after having left, goes away to a distance of four cubits from the lavatory, and puts on his phylacteries.</p>
<p>18. This rule only applies to the case of a permanent lavatory. But one may not enter an extemporized lavatory with phylacteries even rolled up. They should be removed and given to another person for safe keeping.</p>
<p>19. If one wearing phylacteries needed to go to the lavatory at eventide when there would be no more time to put them on again, he should not enter with the phylacteries rolled up in his garment, even to relieve his bladder, if the lavatory is a permanent one. How should he act? He should remove the phylacteries, place them in their bag which must be at least a hand breadth long, or even in a smaller bag provided it is not specially assigned as a receptable for phylacteries. This he keeps in his hand and enters. Thus, too, at night time, if he needs to visit the lavatory, he may put the phylacteries in a bag which he keeps in his hand when entering.</p>
<p>20. Translation omitted.</p>
<p>21. Translation omitted.</p>
<p>22. One is permitted to put on phylacteries in that portion of a bathhouse where all are attired. In that portion where some are in their attire while others are nude, the phylacteries which one wears need not be removed, but they may not be put on. Where all are nude, the phylacteries must be removed, and needless to add, they may not be put on.</p>
<p>23. A person should not walk in a cemetery with phylacteries on his head. When he is within a distance of four cubits from a corpse or a grave, the phylacteries are to be removed till he has passed on to a distance outside four cubits. Phylacteries must not be put on before one is decently covered and has put on his garments. If a person is carrying a burden on his head, he must remove the phylactery from his head, and may not put it on till he has removed the burden. Even a kerchief [alone] may not be put upon the head when one is wearing phylacteries. But he puts his cap over the phylactery.</p>
<p>24. In a room where there are phylacteries or a scroll of the Law, marital intercourse may not take place, till these have been taken out, or placed in a receptacle which itself is enclosed in another receptacle not assigned to the use of phylacteries or a scroll of the Law. If the latter receptacle has been so assigned, and even if there be ten such receptacles, they are all regarded as one receptacle. If he placed the sacred articles in two receptacles, one within the other, they may be put for security under his pillow between the bolster and the coverlid&#x2014;not however exactly beneath his head. This may be done even if his wife shares his couch.</p>
<p>25. The sanctity of phylacteries is a high degree of sanctity. As long as phylacteries are on a man&#x2019;s head and arm, he is humble and God-fearing, is not drawn into frivolity and idle talk, does not dwell on evil thoughts but occupies his mind with thoughts of truth and righteousness. A man should therefore endeavour to wear phylacteries the whole day, this being the right way of fulfilling the precept. It is said of <italic>Rav,</italic> the disciple of our Sainted Teacher (R. Judah, the Prince), that throughout his life no one saw him, without Torah, Tzitzis (fringes on his garments) or phylacteries.</p>
<p>26. Although the proper mode of fulfilling the precept is to wear phylacteries the whole day, it is especially a duty to do so during the recital of prayers. The sages say, &#x201C;Whoever reads the <italic>Shema</italic> without wearing phylacteries is regarded as testifying falsely in his own person.<xref rid="fn67">&#x002A;</xref> Whoever does not wear phylacteries at all violates eight affirmative precepts, since in each of the four sections, the command is set forth to lay phylacteries on the head and on the arm. Whoever wears phylacteries regularly will be blessed with longevity, as it is said, &#x2018;The Lord is upon them: they shall live&#x2019;&#x201D; (Isaiah 38:16).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>
<p>1. How is the <italic>Mezuzah</italic><xref rid="fn68">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> written? Two sections of the Pentateuch, those beginning, &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:4) and, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 11:13) are written in a single column on one slip of parchment. A space of half a nail&#x2019;s breadth is left as a margin above and below the column. If the Pentateuchal sections were written in two or three columns, the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is fit for use. They must not however be written in the shape of a tail (broad at the top line and gradually narrowing to a point), or of a circle, or of a tent (narrow at the top and broadening to the base). A <italic>Mezuzah</italic> written in any of these forms is unfit for use. If the text was written out of order, for example, if the second section was in front of the first, it is unfit for use. If it was written on two slips of parchment, even though these were sewn together, the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is unfit for use. A Scroll of the Law that has become worn out or phylacteries that are worn out may not be used for a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> Nor may margins cut off from a scroll of the Law be so used; for anything dedicated to a sacred purpose may not be degraded from a higher to a lower degree of sacredness.</p>
<p>2. It is a <italic>Mitzvah</italic> (an act of piety) to separate the section beginning, &#x201C;Hear, O Israel&#x201D; from that beginning, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass&#x201D; by a &#x201C;closed&#x201D; space (blank of nine letters). If the division between the two sections was an &#x201C;open&#x201D; one (the second section beginning a new line), the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is fit for use, as, in the Pentateuch, the second section does not immediately follow the first. Special heed should be paid to the tittles in the <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> The following are the tittles which are made in the <italic>Mezuzah.</italic></p>
<p>3. In the first section, there are seven letters, each of which should have above it three upright lines in the shape of the letter <italic>Zain.</italic> They are the <italic>Shin</italic> and <italic>Ayin</italic> in <italic>Shema; Nun</italic> in <italic>Nafshecha;</italic> the two <italic>Zain</italic> in <italic>Mezuzoth;</italic> the two <italic>Teth</italic> in <italic>Totafoth.</italic> The second section has six letters, each of which should have above it three <italic>Zain</italic>-shaped lines. They are the <italic>Gimel</italic> in <italic>Degancha;</italic> the two <italic>Zain</italic> in <italic>Mezuzoth;</italic> the two <italic>Teth</italic> in <italic>Totafoth;</italic> the <italic>Tzadi</italic> in <italic>Ha-aretz.</italic> If the tittles were omitted or if they are more or less than those specified, the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> has not been rendered unfit for use. But if it was written without the lines having been ruled, or if the scribe paid no heed to <italic>plene</italic> or <italic>defective</italic> letters, or if he added in the text even a single letter, the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is unfit for use.</p>
<p>4. It is a universal custom to write the word <italic>Shaddai</italic> (Almighty) on the other side of the <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> opposite the blank space between the two sections. As this word is written on the outside, the practice is unobjectionable. They, however, who write names of angels, holy names, a Biblical text or inscriptions usual on seals, within the <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> are among those who have no portion in the world to come. For these fools not only fail to fulfill the commandment but they treat an important precept that expresses the Unity of God, the love of Him, and His worship, as if it were an amulet to promote their own personal interests; for, according to their foolish minds, the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is something that will secure for them advantage in the vanities of the world.<xref rid="fn69">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>5. It is a <italic>Mitzvah</italic> (act of piety) to write <italic>Al Ha-aretz</italic> (the last two words) on the last line, either at the beginning or in the middle of the line. All the scribes follow the custom of writing the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> in twenty-two lines, and (the last two words) <italic>Al Ha-aretz</italic> at the commencement of the last line. The following are the words in order, which begin each of the lines: (See the Hebrew text on the corresponding right-hand side, page 127b.)</p>
<p>6. When the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is folded, it is rolled up from the end of the line to the beginning, so that anyone opening it is able to read it from the beginning to the end of the line. After it has been rolled up, it is placed in a cylinder of reed, wood or other material, which is attached to the doorpost with a nail; or else a cavity is hollowed out in the doorpost, into which the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is inserted.</p>
<p>7. Before one affixes it to the doorpost, he recites the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to affix the <italic>Mezuzah&#x201D;.</italic> No blessing is recited at the time when it is written, because the affixing of it constitutes the fulfillment of the precept.</p>
<p>8. If one suspended it on a staff, it is unfit, for this is not affixing it (to the doorpost). If one placed it behind the door, he has not fulfilled the precept. If he perforated the door and forced the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> into it like a nail, as a bolt is inserted in the staple-ring, it is unfit. If it was placed in a hollow of the doorpost at a depth of a hand-breadth, it is unfit. If one cut a stick, put a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> on it, attached this stick to other sticks and made of them all a doorpost, it is unfit, because the affixing of the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> preceded the erection of the doorpost.</p>
<p>9. The <italic>Mezuzah</italic> of a private dwelling is examined once every seven years; that attached to a public building twice in the Jubilee (fifty years). The object is to ascertain whether a letter has been torn away or obliterated; because owing to the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> being affixed to walls, it is liable to decay.</p>
<p>10. The fulfillment of the precept of the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is incumbent upon all Israelites, including women and slaves (of Israelites). Children under the age of thirteen years are trained to affix the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> to their rooms. One who rents a dwelling outside the Holy Land, or lodges at an inn in the Holy Land is exempt from the obligation of affixing a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> for a period of thirty days after beginning his occupancy. But if one rents a home in the Holy Land, the duty of affixing a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> devolves immediately.</p>
<p>11. If one lets a dwelling to another person, the duty devolves upon the lessee to bring a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> and attach it, even if he has to pay for doing so, for the precept of the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is the personal obligation of the occupant and not an obligation attaching to the structure. When he surrenders possession, he must not, on quitting the premises, remove the Mezuzah. But if the owner is a non-Israelite, the Jewish tenant, when leaving, takes it away.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI</h1>
<p>1. There are ten conditions which must exist in a dwelling, to put the occupant under an obligation to affix a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> If one of these is absent, he is exempt. These are as follows: The dwelling must have a superficial area of four cubits by four cubits or more; it must have two door-posts, a lintel, a roof and doors; the entrance should be ten hand-breadths high or more; it must be a secular (not a sacred) structure; it must have been erected for human occupancy, for honored use (not a lavatory), and built for permanent habitation.</p>
<p>2. A dwelling, the superficial area of which is less than four cubits by four cubits does not require a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> If its area is equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits, even if it is circular in shape or has five angles, or, needless to add, if its length is greater than its breadth, it requires a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> provided that it covers an area equal to a square of four cubits by four cubits.</p>
<p>3. A porch, that is a place with three walls and a roof, even though it has two uprights on the fourth side does not need a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> the uprights serving to support the roof and not as doorposts. Thus too, a roof without walls that rests on pillars on either side, even if it presents the appearance of a dwelling is exempt from the obligation of having a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> on account of its having no doorposts&#x2014;the pillars having been erected to support the roof.</p>
<p>4. A dwelling with posts on either side (of the door), and in the place of the lintel an arch in the shape of a bow, requires a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> provided that the posts are ten hand-breadths high or more. If they are not ten hand-breadths high, there is no such obligation, as the dwelling has no lintel.</p>
<p>5. A dwelling without a roof does not require a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> Where part of it is covered with a roof and part uncovered, it seems to me that if the portion over the entrance is roofed, the structure requires a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> After the doors are set up, the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is affixed.</p>
<p>6. The Temple Mount, its chambers and courts, synagogues and houses of study which have no residences are exempt, because they are sacred. A village synagogue in which transients lodge requires a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> So too, a city synagogue which has a dwelling house attached to it, requires a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> None of the Temple entrances had a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> except the Gate of Nikanor, and the gate within that gate, and the entrance to the Chamber of Parhedrin, because this chamber was the High Priest&#x2019;s residence during his seven days of seclusion (prior to the Day of Atonement).</p>
<p>7. A hayloft, a cattle-shed, a wood store and a barn are exempted from the obligation of a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> because of the phrase, &#x201C;thy house&#x201D; (in the text &#x201C;thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy house&#x201D;), which means a dwelling assigned to thy use and excludes the aforementioned and similar classes of buildings. Hence, a cattle-shed, where women stay adorning themselves, must have a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> because it also serves as a human habitation. A lodge or porch&#x2014;either rectangular or circular&#x2014;leading to a garden, a garden and a sheepfold are exempt from the obligation of a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> because they are not constructed to serve as residences. If dwellings requiring a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> open to these places, the latter must also have a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic></p>
<p>8. Hence, entrances, whether leading to courtyards or to passages, and gates of districts or cities, must each have a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> because dwellings which require a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> open on to them. Even where ten rooms open one to the other, each requires a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> just as the innermost room requires it. This is the reason for the rule that a gate opening from the garden to a courtyard requires a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic></p>
<p>9. A privy, bath-house, ritual bath-house, tannery and similar places are exempt from the obligation of a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> because they are not erected to serve as dwellings for honored use. The tabernacle for the feast of Tabernacles, and a room in a ship are exempt from the obligation of a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> because they are not made for permanent occupancy. Of two potter&#x2019;s booths, one leading to the other, the exterior is exempt from the obligation of a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> because it is not permanent. Shops in market places are exempt, because they are not intended to be used as residences.</p>
<p>10. A dwelling with several doors, although only one is regularly used for coming in and going out, must have a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> affixed to each door. A small door between a dwelling (below) and the attic needs a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> Every room in a dwelling, even a room within a room, must have a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> at the entrance of the inner chamber, of the outer chamber and of the house, for they all serve the purpose of residence and are permanent.</p>
<p>11. A door between a house of study or synagogue and a private house, if used habitually for entering and leaving, requires a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> If a door is between two dwellings, the position of the hinge determines the side on which the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is to be fixed. The side on which the hinge is visible is regarded as the dwelling in reference to which the position of the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> is decided.</p>
<p>12. Where is the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> to be fixed? Within the width of the doorpost, a hand-breadth from the external edge at a height of a third of the elevation of the entrance, counting from the top. If placed higher it is fit in position, provided that it is a hand-breadth lower than the lintel. It should be fixed on the right side of one entering; if placed on the left side, it is unfit for use. A house owned by partners requires a <italic>Mezuzah.</italic></p>
<p>13. A person should pay heed to the precept of the <italic>Mezuzah;</italic> for it is an obligation perpetually binding upon all. Whenever one enters or leaves a home with the <italic>Mezuzah</italic> on the doorpost, he will be confronted with the Declaration of God&#x2019;s Unity, blessed be His holy name; and will remember the love due to God, and will be aroused from his slumbers and his foolish absorption in temporal vanities. He will realize that nothing endures to all eternity save knowledge of the Ruler of the Universe. This thought will immediately restore him to his right senses and he will walk in the paths of righteousness. Our ancient teachers said: He who has phylacteries on his head and arm, fringes on his garment and a Mezuzah on his door may be presumed not to sin, for he has many monitors&#x2014;angels that save him from sinning, as it is said, (Psalms 34:8) &#x201C;The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them&#x201D;.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>
<p>1. It is an affirmative precept binding upon every individual Israelite to write a scroll of the Law for his own use, as it is said, &#x201C;Now therefore write ye this Song for you&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 31:19). As the Torah is not written in separate sections, this text means, &#x201C;Write for yourselves the Torah in which this Song is contained.&#x201D; Even if one&#x2019;s ancestors have left a person a scroll, it is a religious duty to write a scroll at his own expense. If he wrote it with his own hand, it is accounted to him as if he had received it from Sinai. If one does not know how to write a scroll, he should get others to write it for him. He who corrects a scroll, even a single letter of it, is regarded as if he had written it completely.</p>
<p>2. A king has the duty of writing for himself another scroll of the Law, in his capacity as sovereign, in addition to the scroll which he owns in his private capacity, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law, etc.&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:18). This copy is corrected by comparison with a scroll kept in the temple court, and under the authority of the Supreme Judicature. The scroll which the king had possessed when he was a private individual, he places in his archives. The one that he wrote or had written for him when he became king, should always be with him. If he goes to war, the scroll is to be with him. When he enters his home, it is to be with him. When he hears a cause (tries a case) it is to be with him. When he sits down to a meal, it is to be placed before him, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 17:19).</p>
<p>3. If he possessed no scroll before he came to the throne, he has to write, after his accession, two scrolls of the law, one of which he places in his archives, while the other is to be always with him. It must never be away from him, except at night, or when he goes to the bath or the lavatory or lies down on his couch to sleep.</p>
<p>4. A scroll of the Law that has been written without having been ruled, or that has been written partly on parchment made of whole hide and partly on that made of the inner half of split hide is unfit for use. It must be entirely written either on the former or on the latter. How is a scroll of the law to be written? The scribe is to use the correct script and it should also be exceedingly fine. Between one word and another, he is to leave the space of a small letter; between one letter and another (in the same word) the space of a hair&#x2019;s breadth; between one line and the next the space of a line. The length of each line is to be thirty letters, wide enough to write the word Le-Mi-Sh-Pe-Ch-O-S-E-Che-M<xref rid="fn70">&#x002A;</xref> three times. This is to be the width of each column. No line shall be shorter, so that the column shall not look like an epistle. Nor should any line be wider so that the reader&#x2019;s eyes should not have to wander across the sheet.</p>
<p>5. He should not diminish the size of the characters in order to leave a space between one paragraph and another. When he comes (at the end of a line) to a word of five letters, he must not write two within the column and three outside the column; but he is to write three letters within the column and two outside the column. If there is not enough space left at the end of the line to write three letters, he is to leave it blank and begin at the commencement of the next line.</p>
<p>6. If at the end of a line, he has a word of two letters to write, he may not place it between the columns (that is, outside the column) but he writes it at the beginning of the next line. If, before the line is filled up, he has a word of ten letters, more or less, to write and there is not enough space left on the line to write it all within the column, if he is able to write half the word within the column and half outside the column, he may do so. If he cannot do this, he leaves the space blank and writes the word at the beginning of the next line.</p>
<p>7. Between each book and the next, he leaves a space of four lines, no more and no less, blank without any writing, and starts the next book at the beginning of the fifth line. When completing the Torah, he is to finish it in the middle of the line at the end of the column. If several lines of the column would be left, he shortens the lines, so as to begin at the beginning of the last line of the column and not complete it, and also so plans the lines that the final words <italic>Le-&#x00E9;n&#x00E9; Chol Yisrael</italic> (&#x201C;in the sight of all Israel&#x201D;) shall be in the middle of the line at the end of the column.</p>
<p>8. He should pay careful attention to the letters that are written large or small, to the letters that are punctuated with dots above them, to the letters that are written differently to the others, such as the letter P&#x00E9; and the letters that are curved, in the way the scribes have carried on the tradition. He is to pay attention to the tittles<xref rid="fn71">&#x002A;</xref> and the number of them in each case&#x2014;one letter having above it a single tittle, another having seven tittles. All the tittles have the shape of the letter <italic>Zain</italic> and are to be thin as a hair.</p>
<p>9. All these provisoes are only stated in order that the duty of writing a scroll shall be observed in the most perfect way. If, however the scribe made changes in the method here set forth, was not careful in regard to the tittles, writing however all the letters correctly, or if he wrote the lines close together or far apart, extended the lines or shortened them&#x2014;since he did not join any letter to another, omit aught or add aught, mar the form of any letter, nor make any variation in regard to which paragraphs should be open and which closed, the scroll is fit for use.</p>
<p>10. There are other rules mentioned in the Talmud which the scribes observe as a tradition handed down from one to another. They are as follows: The number of lines in each column shall not be less than forty-eight and not more than sixty; the blank spaces between one section and another shall be such that nine letters, e.g., A She R, A She R, A She R, can be written in it. The five lines preceding the Song at the Red Sea (Exodus 14:28, 29, 30, 30, 31) shall begin respectively with the words <italic>Habaim, Bayabashah, Hashem, Mes, Bemitzraim.</italic> The five lines after it shall begin respectively with the words <italic>Vatikach, Achareha, Sus, Vayetz&#x00EB;&#x00FC;, Vayav&#x00F6;&#x00FC;</italic> (Exodus 15:20, 20, 21, 22, 23). The six lines before the Song of Moses beginning <italic>Haazinu</italic> (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) shall respectively commence with the words <italic>Veaeedah, Achar&#x00E9;, Haderech, Beacharith, Lehacheeso, Kehal</italic> (Deuteronomy 31:28, 29, 29, 29, 29, 30); and the five lines after the Song of Moses shall begin with the words <italic>Vayabo, Ledabber, Asher, Hazoth, Asher</italic> (Deuteronomy 32:44, 45, 46, 46, 47). All these points of observance are to enable us to fulfill the duty in the best way. Variations in these particulars do not render the scroll unfit for use.</p>
<p>11. But if the scribe wrote <italic>defective</italic> a word that should be <italic>plene</italic> or vice versa; or a word traditionally pronounced differently to the way it is written, according to the traditional pronunciation, for example, if he wrote <italic>Yishkevenoh</italic> instead of <italic>Yishgelenoh,</italic> or <italic>Oovatechorim</italic> instead of <italic>Oova-apolim,</italic> etc.; or if he wrote an &#x201C;open&#x201D; section as if it were a closed section or vice versa; or if he wrote one of the Songs like the ordinary prose text, or an ordinary section in the form of one of the Songs, the scroll is unfit for use as a scroll of the Law. It has not the sacredness of a scroll of the Law, but is like any one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught.</p>
<p>12. A scroll of the Law, which has not been examined for correctness may not be kept longer than thirty days. It must either be corrected or segregated.<xref rid="fn72">&#x002A;</xref> A scroll of the Law which has three errors in each column should be corrected. If there are four, it must be put away. If the greater portion has been found to be correct, and the remainder has four errors in each column, but there is even one column in this erroneous portion with less than four errors, corrections could be made.</p>
<p>13. This rule only applies to cases where the scribe wrote <italic>defective</italic> words that should be written <italic>plene</italic> so that he would be under the necessity of inserting the letters that he forgot between the lines. But if he wrote <italic>plene</italic> words that are <italic>defective,</italic> even if every column contains several errors, he corrects them, as he only erases and does not have to insert letters between the lines.</p>
<p>14. It is permitted to write the Pentateuch, each book in a separate scroll. These scrolls have not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law that is complete. One may not however write a scroll containing some sections. Such a scroll may not be written for a child&#x2019;s instruction. This is permitted, however, where there is the intention to complete the remainder of the book. If one wrote such a scroll with three words on each line, this is permitted.</p>
<p>15. The Pentateuch, the Prophets and the Hagiography may be put together in one volume. In such a case, a space of four lines is left blank between each book of the Pentateuch and the next; a space of three lines between each of the major Prophets and the next; and a space of three lines between each of the twelve minor prophets and the next, so that he can, if he wishes, separate any book. The order of the prophetical books is as follows: Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Isaiah, the Twelve Minor Prophets. The order of the books of the Hagiography is: Ruth, Psalms, Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs, Lamentations, Daniel, Esther, Ezra, Chronicles.</p>
<p>16. None of The Holy Scriptures may be written except on ruled lines, even if they are written on paper: Three words of Scripture may be written without ruling the line, but to write more is forbidden. A volume containing the Pentateuch, Prophets and Hagiography has not the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, but of a single book of the Pentateuch. The scroll which contains more than the entire Pentateuch is in the same class as that which contains less than the entire Pentateuch, on the principle that excess is similar to deficiency.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VIII.</h1>
<p>1. The <italic>open</italic> section has two forms. If the previous section ended in the middle of a line, the scribe leaves the remainder of the line blank and commences the open section at the beginning of the next line. This only applies to the case where, after the conclusion of the previous section, there is left sufficient space on the line to write nine letters. But if the space left is less, or if the previous section was completed at the end of the line, the next line must be left blank, and the open section is begun at the commencement of the third line.</p>
<p>2. A <italic>closed</italic> section has three forms. If the previous section ended within the line, the scribe leaves a blank space for the required dimension (enough to write nine letters) and begins the closed section at the end of the line, provided that there is a blank space between it and the preceding section. If the completion of the previous section did not leave space for the blank of the required breadth and for writing (at least) one word at the end of the line, the scribe should leave the remainder of the line blank, leave a little space at the beginning of the next line blank, and begin the closed section within the line. If the previous section ended at the close of the line, he leaves a blank space of the required breadth (nine letters), at the beginning of the next line, and begins to write the closed section within the line. Hence, you may say that an open section always begins within the line.</p>
<p>3. A scroll which is inaccurate in regard to words that are written <italic>plene</italic> or <italic>defective</italic> can be made good by being corrected, as already explained. But if the scribe made a mistake in the spacing between the sections, and wrote an open section as if it were a closed section, or a closed section as if it were an open section or left a space where a section does not end, or continued writing without leaving a space where a section ends, or deviated from the form in which the Songs are written, in all these cases, the Scroll is unfit for use and there is no remedy except to remove the entire column in which the mistake occurs.</p>
<p>4. As in all the scrolls I have seen, I noticed serious incorrectness in these regards, while authorities on the Massorah, who write treatises and compilations with the aim of pointing out the sections that are closed and those that are open, differ according to the variations in the scrolls on which they rely, I deemed it fit to write here a list of the sections which are closed and those which are open, as also the forms in which the Songs of the Pentateuch are written so that all the scrolls may be corrected from, and compared with them. The copy on which I relied is the well-known Egyptian codex which contains the twenty-four books of the Scriptures and which had been in Jerusalem for several years&#x2014;used as the standard text for the examination of scrolls. Everyone relied upon it because it had been examined by Ben Asher who closely studied it for many years and examined it again whenever it was being copied. This codex was the text on which I relied in the scroll of the Law that I wrote according to the rules.</p>
<p>(Here follow lists of open and closed sections which are in the Hebrew text on the right-hand pages 131b to 136b.)</p>
<p>THE BOOK OF GENESIS</p>
<p>The number of open sections is 43; of closed sections 48; total 91.</p>
<p>THE BOOK OF EXODUS</p>
<p>The number of open sections is 69; of closed sections, 95; total 164.</p>
<p>THE BOOK OF LEVITICUS</p>
<p>The number of open sections is 52; of closed sections, 46; total 98.</p>
<p>THE BOOK OF NUMBERS</p>
<p>The number of open sections is 92; of closed sections, 66; total 158.</p>
<p>THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY</p>
<p>The number of open sections of this book is 34; of closed sections, 124, total 158. The number of open sections in the entire Pentateuch is 290; of the closed sections, 379; total 669.</p>
<p>The form of the Song <italic>Haazinu</italic> (Deuteronomy 32:1-43). Every line has a blank space in the middle, like that preceding a closed section. Hence, every line is divided into two parts. The song is written in 70 lines. The words at the beginning of the lines are as follows:</p>
<p>(See the Hebrew text on the right hand side page 136a)</p>
<p>All these are the words at the beginning of the lines. And the following are the words at the beginning of the latter half of the line which are in the middle of the column.</p>
<p>(See the Hebrew text on the right hand pages 136a and 136b)</p>
<p>The Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15:1-19) is written in thirty lines, the first line in the ordinary way; the other lines, one with a blank space in the middle, the next with blank spaces in two places, so that the line is divided into three parts and so a blank space corresponds to writing (above and below it) and vice versa as follows.</p>
<p>See the Hebrew text on the right-hand side 136a, 136b and 137a as it should be written in the scroll. The English pages should be blank.</p>
<p>Throughout the Torah, in the Songs as well as in the rest of the text, the scribe should aim to write all the letters of each word close together, taking care that no letter should be joined to another, and that no letter should be so far away from the next as to make the word seem two words. The interval between the letters in one word should be a hairbreadth. If the scribe wrote one letter so far apart from the other that it would appear to a child who is not familiar with the text like two words, the scroll is unfit for use till he makes the correction.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IX.</h1>
<p>1. The length of a scroll of the Law should not exceed the circumference, nor should the circumference exceed the length. What is a suitable length? Where parchment of a whole hide is used, six hand-breadths, that is twenty-four finger-breadths taking the thumb as the standard. Where the parchment of the external half of the hide is used, the length may be more or less than this dimension, provided only that the length is equal to the circumference. So also in the case of parchment of a whole hide, if the scribe made the length less than six hand-breadths and wrote in a small hand or longer than six handbreadths and spread out the writing so that the length of the column is equal to the circumference&#x2014;this too is correct.</p>
<p>2. The extent of the lower margin is four finger-breadths; of the upper margin, three finger-breadths; between one column and another, two finger-breadths. Hence, on the right and left of every sheet of parchment, the scribe has to leave a margin a finger-breadth wide and enough beside for sewing; so that, when the sheets are sewn together, there will be throughout the scroll a blank space of two finger-breadths between the columns. The scribe must leave in addition enough margin at the beginning and end of the scroll to fold a blank column round the rollers. All these dimensions are to be observed in order to fulfill the precept properly. But if the scribe exceeded or fell short of them, he does not render the scroll unfit for use.</p>
<p>3. How shall one proceed so that the length of the scroll shall turn out equal to its circumference. The parchment sheets are made evenly rectangular; each sheet being six handbreadths wide, all of the same dimensions. They are rolled evenly into one bundle tightly rolled up. And skins are added and tightly rolled till the circumference is six handbreadths, which is the width of the sheets. This is measured with a thread of wool which is placed round the bundle.</p>
<p>4. The scribe then fashions a straight ruler, forty or fifty finger-breadths long; one of these finger-breadths, he marks in two, three and four equal parts so as to be able to measure off a half, a third and a quarter of a finger-breadth and similar fractions. With this, he measures each sheet, so as to ascertain the number of finger-breadths it contains and so determine how many finger-breadths there are in the entire bundle.</p>
<p>5. He then takes two or three other sheets of parchment, to test the size of the characters, and writes on them one column. The length of a column of writing is obviously seventeen finger-breadths as a margin must be left, of three finger-breadths above and four finger-breadths below. The width of the column will depend on the handwriting, whether it is large or small. So also, the number of lines will vary according to the handwriting, as between each line and the next, the space of a line must be left.</p>
<p>6. Having written the column which he uses as a test as he pleases, he measures its breadth by means of the finger-breadths of the ruler, and adds two finger-breadths for the margin between column and column. He then calculates how many columns of such writing would fill the sheets in the bundle he had made up. Having ascertained the total number of columns, he will then see how much of the entire Pentateuch is in the column which he wrote as a test. He will make the estimate with the aid of the scroll which serves him as a copy, and calculate accordingly. If the number of columns of the kind of writing which he wrote is sufficient for the whole Torah&#x2014;well and good. If the calculation showed that there are more columns than are required for the whole Torah, he will enlarge the writing, so as to diminish the number of columns, and he will make a test with another column. If the calculation shows that for the writing of the Torah more columns will be required than are contained in his sheets, he will use smaller characters and so secure a larger number of columns. He will make the test with column after column till the calculation comes out exact.</p>
<p>7. Once he knows the width of the column and the size of the characters, he can begin writing the scroll with that bundle of sheets. He then divides the parchment (sheets) into columns by ruling them off,&#x2014;each column of the same width as that which his tests and calculations showed to be the right size. If three or four finger-breadths are left over beyond the last column, he should leave one finger-breadth and enough besides for sewing the sheet to the next, and cut off the rest, and need feel no apprehension, for at the end, more sheets will be added to make up for the superfluous strips that he cut off from each sheet. Nor need he make any calculations in regard to this, for the writing will be according to the number of columns.</p>
<p>8. So too, if one wishes to make the width of the scroll more or less than six handbreadths, he makes his calculation in the same way; and the length will be exactly equal to the circumference neither more nor less, provided that no mistake has been made in the calculation.</p>
<p>9. The finger-breadth in all the dimensions here and in the rest of the Torah is that of the medium sized finger. On careful examination, we find it to be the breadth of seven medium sized barley corns placed close together, this being equal to the length of two barley corns measured liberally. The handbreadth, wherever mentioned, is equal to four such finger-breadths. A cubit is six handbreadths.</p>
<p>10. The scroll which I wrote had a width of four finger-breadths to each column. The columns containing the Song of the Red Sea (Exodus 15.1-18) <italic>Haazinu</italic> (Deuteronomy 32:1-43) were each six finger-breadths wide. The number of lines in each column were fifty-one. The number of columns in the whole scroll were 226 columns. The length of the entire scroll was 13366 finger-breadths approximately.</p>
<p>11. The six finger-breadths left over were for the margin at the beginning and end of the scroll. The parchment skins on which we wrote were ramskins. Whenever you desire to write a scroll and follow these measurements completely or approximately, you need not weary yourself to make a calculation if you have one, two or three columns less or more; you will find that the length will be equal to the circumference.</p>
<p>12. No sheet should have less than three, nor more than eight columns. If a sheet is wide enough to contain nine columns, it is cut into two parts, one to contain four columns, the other to contain five columns. This rule applies to the beginning and middle of the scroll. But at the close, even if there is only left one verse to write on a column, that column is prepared on a separate sheet and sewn on to the other sheets.</p>
<p>13. For sewing the sheets together, only the sinews of a clean beast domestic or wild, including those that are <italic>Terefah</italic><xref rid="fn73">&#x002A;</xref> or <italic>Nevelah</italic>,<xref rid="fn74">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> may be used. The law here is the same as in regard to phylacteries. This rule goes back to Moses who received it on Sinai. Hence if the sheets have been sewn together but not with sinews or with sinews of an unclean animal, the scroll is unfit for use till the stitches are taken out and the sewing is done according to rule.</p>
<p>14. When the sheets are sewn together, they are sewn entirely from top to bottom, but a small portion is left above and below without being stitched, so that the scroll, when it is rolled up, may not be torn in the middle. Two wooden rollers are prepared, one for either end. The unwritten margins of parchment at the beginning and at the end are brought round the rollers and sewn with sinews, so that the scroll can be rolled over them; a clear space being left between the margin and the writing in the columns.</p>
<p>15. In case a scroll of the law had one of its sheets torn, the rent is sewn up, if it extends to two lines; if it extends to three lines, it is not sewn up. This rule applies to a scroll the gall dressing of which is no longer perceptible. But if the parchment still shows that it has been dressed, then, even when the rent extends to three lines, it is sewn up. So too, a rent between columns or between words is sewn up. For the stitching of the rents, the same kind of sinews are used as for the sheets. And wherever there is a rent, the scribe should make sure that no letter is missing or altered in form.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER X.</h1>
<p>1. You thus find that there are twenty factors, any one of which disqualifies a scroll of the law. If any of these occurs, the scroll is like one of the books of the Pentateuch out of which children are taught. It does not possess the sanctity of a scroll of the Law, and is not used for reading in public worship. They are as follows:</p>
<p>1) If it was written on the skin of a beast of an unclean species;</p>
<p>2) or on the skin of a beast of a clean species, which had not been tanned;</p>
<p>3) If the skin had been tanned but not for the express purpose of being used as a scroll of the law;</p>
<p>4) If it was written on the wrong side; in the case of parchment of whole hide on the side next to the flesh; in the case of parchment of the outer half of a split hide, on the side adjacent to the hair;</p>
<p>5) If it was written partly on parchment of whole hide and partly on that made of the outer half of split hide;</p>
<p>6) If it was written on the inner half of a split hide;</p>
<p>7) If it was written without the lines having been previously ruled;</p>
<p>8) If it was written with a dark writing fluid that does not make a permanent impression;</p>
<p>9) If it was written in other languages;</p>
<p>10) If it was written by a heretic (Epikouros) or other disqualified persons;</p>
<p>11) If the scribe wrote the names of God without special concentration of mind;</p>
<p>12) If a single letter was omitted;</p>
<p>13) If a single letter was added;</p>
<p>14) If one letter touched another;</p>
<p>15)	If a single letter was so marred that it cannot be read at all, or resembles another letter, whether the defect is in the writing, or is due to a perforation, rent or smudge;</p>
<p>16)	If the scribe wrote letters so far apart or so closely together that one word looks like two words or two words look like one word;</p>
<p>17)	If he altered the form of the sections<xref rid="fn75">&#x002A;</xref>;</p>
<p>18)	If he varied the form of writing the Songs;</p>
<p>19)	If he wrote any other portion in the form of a Song;</p>
<p>20)	If he did not sew the sheets with sinews of a beast of a clean species.</p>
<p>The other conditions stated are recommended as the best way of performing the duty of writing a scroll. Their non-observance does not render it unfit for use.</p>
<p>2. A scroll of the law that is fit for use is to be regarded as an object of extreme holiness and treated with great reverence. A person is forbidden to sell a scroll of the law even if he has nothing to eat, and even if he owns other scrolls. He may not even sell an old scroll, to buy a new one. A scroll may only be sold for one of two purposes, to provide means to enable one to study Torah or to marry&#x2014;and then only if the owner has nothing else that he can sell.</p>
<p>3. If a scroll of the law has become worn out or been otherwise rendered unfit for use; it is placed in an earthenware vessel and buried beside the remains of deceased scholars. This is the appropriate method of &#x201C;concealing&#x201D; it (putting it away). Folders of scrolls that have become worn out are used as shrouds for the dead (found on the road) whose interment is a duty binding on all. This is the appropriate method of &#x201C;concealing&#x201D; them.</p>
<p>4. A case specially made for a scroll of the law and in which it has been placed, bands around the scrolls, the chest or structure in which it is deposited even though the scroll is in its case, as also a bench specially made on which to place a scroll of the law, and on which a scroll was placed are all subsidiaries of that which is sacred, and may not be thrown away. When worn out or broken, they are &#x201C;put away&#x201D;. The platforms, however, on which the Reader of the congregation stands and holds the scroll and tablets on which (scriptures) are written for a child&#x2019;s instruction have no sanctity. Golden and silver pomegranates and other such ornaments, made for the embellishment of a scroll of the law are subsidiaries of that which is sacred; and it is forbidden to part with them to be used for secular purposes, unless they were sold with the intention to purchase with their proceeds a scroll of the law or a book of the Pentateuch.</p>
<p>5. It is permitted to place one scroll of the law upon another scroll, or, needless to add, upon single books of the Pentateuch. Single books of the Pentateuch may be placed upon books of the Prophets or Hagiography. But the books of the prophets and of the Hagiography are not placed upon single books of the Pentateuch; nor the latter on a scroll of the law. No sacred writings, not even Halachas or Hagadas (Legalistic or Homiletic works) may be thrown away. Amulets which contain scriptural matter, must not be taken with one into a lavatory (privy) unless they are covered with a skin.</p>
<p>6. A person may not, while bearing a scroll of the law in his arms, enter a bath-house, lavatory, or cemetery, even if the scroll is swathed in folders and placed in its case. A person must not read in it till he has moved away four cubits from the dead body (bath house) or lavatory. One may not hold a scroll of the law when nude. It is forbidden to sit down on a couch on which there is a scroll of the law.</p>
<p>7. Cohabitation is forbidden in a chamber where there is a scroll of the law, till it has been removed or placed in a receptacle which is itself placed in a receptacle not specially assigned to the scroll. If it has however been so assigned, even ten receptacles within each other, are regarded as a single receptacle. If a partition, ten handbreadths high, has been constructed for the scroll, cohabitation may take place if there is no other room. It may not take place, if there is another room, till the scroll has been removed.</p>
<p>8. All who are ritually unclean, even women in their menstruating period, and even a non-Israelite, may hold a scroll of the law and read in it, for the words of the Torah do not contract uncleanliness, provided that the holder&#x2019;s hands are not dirty or soiled. They must therefore wash their hands and then they may touch it.</p>
<p>9. Every one who sees a person carrying a scroll of the law and proceeding with it must stand up before it; and all persons continue standing till the bearer of the scroll stops, having carried it to its appointed place, or passes out of sight. They are then permitted to resume their seats.</p>
<p>10. It is a duty to assign a fixed place for a scroll of the law, and to show it extreme honor and courtesy. The words in the tables of the covenant are in every scroll of the law. One may not expectorate before a scroll of the law, nor indecently expose oneself before it, nor stretch out one&#x2019;s feet before it; nor place it upon the head in the way in which a burden is carried; nor turn one&#x2019;s back to it unless it is at an elevation of ten handbreadths above the person.</p>
<p>11. If one is travelling from place to place and had a scroll of the law with him, he is not to put the scroll in a sack, place it on the donkey&#x2019;s back and ride upon it. If, however, he is afraid of thieves, he may do so. When there is no such apprehension, he places it in his bosom close to his heart, and continues his journey, riding. Any one, sitting before a scroll of the law, should be inspired with a sense of earnestness, awe and reverence, for it is a faithful witness concerning all who come into the world, as it is said, &#x201C;It shall be therefore a witness against thee&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 31:26). All possible honor should be shown it. The ancient sages said, &#x201C;Whoever treats the Torah with contumely will be treated with contumely by his fellow-creatures. Whoever honors the Torah, will receive honor from his fellow creatures&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:8). End of the laws concerning the scroll of the Law by the Grace of God.</p>

<p>1. The fringe that is attached to the corner of the garment, and made of the same species of material as the garment, is called <italic>Tzitzith</italic> Fringes, because it is like the fringes of hair of the head, as it is said, &#x201C;And he took me up by the lock (<italic>Tzitzith</italic>) of my head&#x201D; (Ezekiel 8:3). This fringe is called &#x201C;the White (part)&#x201D;, because we are not commanded to dye it. No definite number of threads is prescribed in the Torah for the fringes.</p>
<p>2. A thread of wool, dyed the color of the sky, is taken and wound round the fringe. This thread is called <italic>Techeleth,</italic> the blue (thread). The number of times this thread should be wound is not specified in the Torah.</p>
<p>3. This precept thus consists of two ordinances;&#x2014;to attach to the corner of the garment a fringe projecting from it, and to wind a blue thread round the fringe, as it is said, &#x201C;Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments &#x2026; and that they put upon the fringe of each corner a thread of blue&#x201D; (Numbers 16:38).</p>
<p>4. The absence of the blue thread does not bar the use of the white fringe. Nor does the absence of the white fringe prevent the use of the blue thread. How so? If a person has no blue thread, he puts in the white fringe alone. So too, if the white fringe and the blue thread have been attached and the white fringe has been severed and diminished up to the corner of the garment and only the blue thread was left, it is fit for use.</p>
<p>5. Though the non-fulfillment of either ordinance does not bar the observance of the other ordinance, they are not two precepts but one precept. The ancient sages said, &#x201C;The text &#x2018;and it shall be unto you for a fringe&#x2019; &#x201D;, teaches that both ordinances form one precept. The four fringes on the garment are, all of them, indispensable, for the attachment of all the four constitute one precept. Whoever puts on a garment with white fringes or a blue thread or with both together has fulfilled one affirmative precept.</p>
<p>6. How are the fringes attached? One begins at the corner of the garment, that is, at the edge of the woven cloth, and measures off a length not greater than three finger-breadths and not less than the length between the base of the thumbnail and the first joint. Four threads are inserted there and turned down in the middle, so that eight twined threads are pendent from the corner, The eight threads are not to be less than four finger-breadths long. If longer, even as much as one or two cubits, they are fit for use. The breadth of the thumb is the standard for all finger-breadths. One of the eight threads should be blue, and seven should be white.</p>
<p>7. One of the white threads is taken up and wound once about the other threads close to the garment. It is then dropped. The blue thread is then taken and wound twice about the other threads close to the winding with the white thread. The threads are then tied. These three windings are called a section. A small space is left; a second section is made, the windings being done with the blue thread only. A small space is left; a third section is made; and so till the last division where the blue thread is wound round the other threads twice and the third winding is done with a white thread, because, as the winding began with a white thread, it should also end with a white thread, on the principle that things sacred may be elevated to a higher degree but may not be degraded to a lower degree. The reason why the winding begins with a white thread is that the corner of the garment shall have adjacent to it threads of the same kind of material. This is the method followed with the four corners.</p>
<p>8. How many divisions are made in the fringes at each corner? Not less than seven and not more than thirteen. This is the choicest mode of carrying out the precept. But if one wound the threads, to form one division only, the fringe is regarded as correctly made. And if one wound the blue thread over the greater portion of the fringes, it is correctly made. The beauty of the blue thread is manifested if all the sections that are wound take up the first third of the pendent fringes, while the remaining two thirds are loose. The threads in this part need to be separated, so that they shall be like the fringes of hair on the head.</p>
<p>9. When a person uses white threads only without a blue thread, he takes one of the eight threads and winds it around the others to the extent of a third of the length, leaving two thirds for the loose fringe. With regard to this winding, if he desires to make divided sections as is done when a blue thread is used, he is at liberty to do so. And this is our custom. If, on the other hand, he desires to make the winding without divisions, he may do so. In short, what he should aim at is that the part wound shall be a third of the length and the fringe two thirds. Some pay no attention to this point, when only white threads are used. If one of the white threads has been wound round the greater portion of their length, or if only a single division has been made, the fringes are regarded as proper.</p>
<p>10. The white as well as the blue threads may be twined, if so desired. Even if the thread consisted of eight threads folded and twined so that it becomes a cord, it is still regarded as one thread only.</p>
<p>11. The threads used for the fringes, whether white or blue, must be spun with the express intention of being made into fringes. They are not made of wool caught by the thorns where the sheep lie down, nor from the wisps that are plucked from the animal, nor from the remainders of the warp left by the weaver on the selvage of the cloth, but only of the wool-shearing or of flax. Nor are the fringes to be made from wool that has been part of the proceeds of a robbery, or that comes from a city that has gone astray (Deuteronomy 13:13-18), nor from wool of beasts set apart for sacrifice. If such wool has been used for fringes, the latter are unfit for use. If a person prostrates himself in worship before a beast, its wool is unfit for use as fringes. But if he so prostrates himself before planted flax, it is fit for use, because its character has been changed.<xref rid="fn76">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>12. Fringes made by a non-Israelite are unfit for use, for it is said, &#x201C;Speak unto the <italic>children of Israel</italic> and bid them that <italic>they</italic> make them &#x2026; fringes&#x201D; (Numbers 15:38). But if an Israelite made them without thinking of their purpose, they are fit for use. Completed fringes attached to a garment are unfit for use.</p>
<p>13. For example, if one took the corner of a garment that had fringes and sewed it on to another garment, even if the corner was a cubit long and a cubit wide, the fringes are unfit for use, for it is said, &#x201C;They shall make unto themselves fringes&#x201D; (Numbers 15:38) but not attach those already made&#x2014;this being analogous to a thing that came into existence of itself. It is however allowable to undo the fringes from one garment and insert them in another, whether the fringes are white or blue.</p>
<p>14. If threads were suspended from one corner of a garment to another and the threads in each corner were tied according to the prescribed rules, after which the threads were severed in the middle, so as to form separate fringes, they are unfit for use, because at the time when the threads were tied they were unfit for use, the two corners being connected by the threads between them, and they only became two fringes when they were severed, so that they were made out of fringes already completed.</p>
<p>15. When a person inserted additional fringes in a garment that already had them, if his intent was to nullify the first set of fringes, he is to undo these or cut them off, and the set subsequently added is fit for use. If however his intent was to add the second set, then, even if he cuts off either of the sets, the one remaining is unfit for use, because by the addition he made all the fringes unfit; and when he undid or cut off a superfluous set of fringes, the one remaining turns out to have been fashioned out of that which had already been complete, and the first time it had been made it was unfit.</p>
<p>16. So too if one inserts fringes in a garment with three corners and then makes a fourth corner and inserts a fringe in it, the fringes are all unfit for use, for it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt make fringes&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:12) and not use those already made.</p>
<p>17. A garment is not to be folded and fringes inserted in the garment as folded, unless one of the edges at least is sewn up.</p>
<p>18. If the corner of the garment in which fringes have been inserted has become torn, and the tear is more than three fingers&#x2019; breadth from the edge, it can be sewn up. If the tear is less than three fingers&#x2019; breadth from the edge, it cannot be sewn up. If the space between the opening into which the fringes are inserted and the edge of the woven fabric has become less, (owing to the edge having worn away) the fringes are fit for use, provided that some portion of the fabric, however small, is still left. So also, if the threads of the fringes have become less in length, they are fit for use, provided that enough of them is left to make a loop. But if even a single thread has been severed at the point where the fringes are inserted, they are unfit.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. Blue thread, wherever it is mentioned in the Torah, is wool dyed azure, the color of the firmament seen in a blue sky when the sun is shining. The blue thread mentioned in connection with fringes must be dyed with a special dye which retains its lustre without change. Wool that has not been dyed in this dye is unfit for use as the blue thread, even though it is of the color of the sky; as, for instance, if it has been dyed with indigo, lamp-black or other darkening material, it cannot be used as the thread of blue with the fringe. The wool of a ewe whose dam was a she-goat is unfit for use as fringes.</p>
<p>2. How are the blue threads used with the fringes to be dyed? Wool is soaked in lime and afterwards washed till it is clean. It is then scalded in a solution of alum and similar substances such as are used by dyers, so that it may take the color. The blood of the <italic>Chalazon</italic> is then taken,&#x2014;a fish the color of which is azure while its blood is black as ink. This fish is found in the Dead Sea. The blood is put into a cauldron together with other ingredients such as potash and similar substances used by dyers, and brought to a boiling point. The wool is immersed in the cauldron till it has assumed the hue of the sky. This is the blue thread used with the fringes.</p>
<p>3. The blue thread of the fringes must be dyed with that express intent. If it has been dyed without this intent, it is unfit for use. If a little wool was dyed in the cauldron containing the coloring material as a test, in order to ascertain whether the color is good or not, the entire contents of the cauldron become unfit. How then is one to proceed? A small portion of the cauldron&#x2019;s contents should be removed into a small vessel. In this, the wool used for testing should be placed, and subsequently burnt, because it was dyed for testing purposes. The dye in the vessel used for testing is also poured away because its being used for testing has rendered it unfit to be used for dyeing the blue thread. The wool which is to serve as the blue thread is dyed in the rest of the dye which has not been spoilt.</p>
<p>4. The blue thread is only to be purchased from a reliable expert. Otherwise there is reason to apprehend that it was not dyed with the express intent to be used with the fringes. Even though it had been bought of an expert, if it was afterwards ascertained that it had been dyed with one of the dark dyes that do not keep the color fast, it is unfit for use.</p>
<p>5. How is it tested, in order to determine whether it has been dyed in accordance with the legal requirements or not? Straw is taken, together with snail&#x2019;s slime and urine that has been permitted to stand for forty days. The wool is immersed in the mixture for a period of twenty-four hours. If the wool keeps its color and does not become paler, it is fit for use. If however it has become paler, dough of barley flour that had been put aside to become stale for fish sauce is taken. Into it, the blue thread, the color of which has faded is placed. The dough is baked in an oven. The blue thread is taken out of the loaf and examined. If it has become still paler, it is unfit for use. If the color is richer and darker than it had been before baking, it is fit for use.</p>
<p>6. In a market where blue thread is sold for fringes, and where the vendors have a reputation for trustworthiness, blue thread may be purchased without enquiry. No investigation is necessary, the benefit of the presumption continuing till suspicion of untrustworthiness arises. If blue thread was deposited with a non-Israelite, it is unfit for use, for fear that the depositary may have substituted other blue thread. If it was in a receptacle sealed with two seals, one within the other, it continues fit for use. If only one seal had been affixed, it becomes unfit for use.</p>
<p>7. Blue threads, found in the street, are unfit for use, even if they are found severed (in the usual lengths). If however they are twined they are fit for use. A garment with fringes is presumed to be fit for use, if bought from an Israelite. It likewise has the benefit of this presumption if purchased from a non-Israelite tradesman. But if the non-Israelite is a private person, the fringes are unfit for use.</p>
<p>8. If a garment is entirely red or green, or of any other color, the fringes which ordinarily are white should be of the same color as the garment; green, if it is green, red, if it is red. If the garment is entirely blue, the ordinary fringes should be of any color except black,&#x2014;black resembling blue. One blue thread is wound round the other fringes just as is done in the case of other fringes that are not colored.</p>
<p>9. Not to attach white fringes to one&#x2019;s garment is more culpable than to omit the blue thread. For the white fringes are procurable by all, while the blue thread cannot be obtained in all places and at all times on account of the need of the special dye, of which we have spoken.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. The garment in which one is bound by scriptural enactment to insert fringes, is a garment that has four corners or more than four corners; its dimensions must be sufficient to cover the head and greater portion of the body of a child that walks by itself in the street and does not need any one to watch it and accompany it; furthermore the garment has to be of wool or linen.</p>
<p>2. Garments of other materials such as silk, cotton, camel&#x2019;s hair, hares&#x2019; down, goats&#x2019; hair, etc., only require fringes by the ordinance of the sages&#x2014;to make us heedful of the precept concerning Fringes, and their ordinance also applies to garments with four or more corners and of the dimensions above stated; for wherever the Torah speaks of garments without special qualification, it refers exclusively to such as are of wool or linen.</p>
<p>3. &#x201C;On the four corners of thy vesture&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:12). This means that a garment requires fringes when it has four corners but not when it has three. But cannot the text also mean that the garment must have four fringes but not five? To guard against this inference, the text concludes, &#x201C;wherewith thou coverest thyself&#x201D;, i.e., even if it has five corners or more. Why however should a garment with five corners be included in the obligation and one with three corners be exempted, seeing that neither has four corners? The answer is that the number five includes the number four. Accordingly, when fringes are inserted in a garment with five or six corners, they are to be inserted in those four of the five or six corners, that are furthest from each other, for it is said, &#x201C;On the four corners of thy vesture.&#x201D;</p>
<p>4. A garment made of cloth (as specified above) and the corners of which are of leather requires fringes. A garment of leather, the corners of which are of cloth is exempt, since the main part of the garment alone is taken into consideration. A garment owned by two partners requires fringes, for it is said, &#x201C;in the corners of their garments&#x201D; (Numbers 15:38). The word &#x201C;thy vesture&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 22:12) is only intended to exclude a borrowed garment from the obligation of fringes. Such a garment is exempt for thirty days, after which fringes must be inserted.</p>
<p>5. For a woolen garment, the white fringes are to be of wool. For a garment of flaxen material (linen) the white fringes are to be threads of linen, these being of the same species. For garments of other materials, the white fringes are to be threads of the same material as the garment, threads of silk for a garment of silk; goats&#x2019; hair threads for a garment of goats&#x2019; hair. If one desires to use woolen or flaxen (linen) threads as fringes for garments made of any other materials, he may do so. The reason is that fringes of wool or flax (linen) satisfy the requirements of the law whether the garments are of the same species of material or not; while fringes of other species are permissible when the garments are of the same species as the fringes but not when they are different.</p>
<p>6. May woolen threads be used as fringes in a garment of flaxen material, or flaxen threads in a woolen garment, even when only white fringes are inserted? According to the strict rule, this should be permissible, since the prohibition of a mixture of wool and flax is suspended in the case of fringes, the blue thread which is of wool being inserted in a garment of flax (linen). Why then is this not done? Because threads of the same material as the garment can be used as fringes. And wherever there are a positive precept and a negative precept, both of which can be observed, this should be done. Where they conflict, the affirmative overrides the negative commandment. In this case, however, both precepts can be observed.</p>
<p>7. In a garment of flax (linen), the blue thread is not inserted, but only white fringes of flaxen (linen) thread. This is not because the precept concerning fringes is superseded by the prohibition of a mixture of wool and flax. But it is a precautionary regulation of the sages who had in mind that such a garment might be worn at night when there is no obligation to have fringes on the garments, and so a prohibition would be violated at a time when there was no (over-riding) affirmative precept in force, since the duty of having fringes is incumbent by day and not at night, as it is said, &#x201C;that ye may look upon it&#x201D; (Numbers 15:39) which means at a time when it can be seen. A blind man is under the obligation of having fringes in his garments; for, although he does not see the fringes, others see them.</p>
<p>8. It is permitted to put on a garment with fringes at night, during the working week-days as well as on the Sabbath, notwithstanding that the precept is not obligatory at night&#x2014;provided however that the blessing for the fringes is not recited. At what time in the morning is the blessing for the fringes recited? From the time when the white fringes can be distinguished from the blue thread. What is the form of the blessing? &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to enwrap ourselves in a garment with fringes&#x201D;. And whenever, during the day such a garment is put on, the blessing is recited before putting it on. When fringes are inserted in a garment, no blessing is recited; the consummation of the precept is putting on the fringed garment.</p>
<p>9. It is permissible, while clad in a garment with fringes, to enter a lavatory (privy) or bath house. If threads either of the white fringes, or the blue cord, have been severed, the fringes may be thrown on the waste-heap, because the fringes though used in the fulfillment of a precept, have no intrinsic sanctity. It is forbidden to sell a garment with fringes to a non-Israelite, unless the fringes are unwound; not because any sanctity attaches to them, but for fear that the non-Israelite, wearing the garment with fringes, may be joined on the road by an Israelite who will deem him a co-religionist, and the Gentile may murder the Israelite.</p>
<p>10. Women, bondsmen and minors are exempted by the Scriptural law from the obligation of having fringes in their garments. The Sages however have prescribed that a male child, as soon as he can put on a garment, is under the obligation of having a garment with fringes, so as to be trained in religious observances. If women or bondsmen desire to wear garments with fringes, no objection is raised, but they do not recite the blessing. The same is the rule with respect to other affirmative precepts from the obligation of which women are exempt. If they wish to fulfill them without reciting the blessing, no objection is raised. Persons of doubtful sex and a hermaphrodite, because of the doubt, are under the obligation to fulfill all the precepts. Hence, they do not recite the blessing, but fulfill the duty without pronouncing the benediction.</p>
<p>11. How is the obligation of the precept of fringes incurred? Anyone upon whom the fulfillment of this precept is incumbent, desirous of putting on a garment that requires fringes, must first insert them and then may put on the garment. If he puts it on before the fringes have been attached, he has neglected an affirmative precept. But garments to which fringes should be attached are exempt as long as no one has worn them and they are kept folded and put away, because the obligation does not attach to the garment, but is incumbent upon the owner of a garment (who wears it).</p>
<p>12. Although one is not bound to purchase a garment and wear it, so as to insert fringes therein, still it is not right for a pious man to release himself from the observance of this commandment. He should always endeavour to be robed in a garment that requires fringes, so as to fulfill this precept. He should be especially heedful of this, during prayer. For scholars it is particularly disgraceful to recite the prayers without being so robed.</p>
<p>13. At all times, a person should be heedful of the precept concerning fringes, since Holy Writ estimates it as so weighty that all the commandments are made dependent upon it, as it is said, &#x201C;And ye shall look upon it and remember all the commandments of the Lord&#x201D; (Numbers 15:39).</p>
<p>Blessed be the All-Merciful, who hath aided us.</p>

<chapter>
<title>LAWS CONCERNING BLESSINGS.</title>
<p>Treating of a single affirmative Scriptural precept, namely, after a meal, to bless the great and holy name of God. The exposition of this precept is given in the following chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>1. It is an affirmative precept of the Torah to say Grace after a meal, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt eat and be satisfied and shalt bless the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 8:10). The Torah only imposes the obligation on a person when he is satisfied; for it is said, &#x201C;When thou hast eaten and art satisfied, thou shalt bless etc.&#x201D; According to the ordinances of the sages, however, even if one has eaten only as much food as the size of an olive, he recites Grace after the meal.</p>
<p>2. It is also an ordinance of the Sages that before partaking of any food, a blessing is first recited and then it is eaten. And however little one intends to eat or drink, the blessing is first recited and then the refreshment is taken. So too, one who wishes to smell a fragrant odor first recites the blessing and then enjoys the fragrance. Whoever partakes of any enjoyment without reciting a blessing commits a trespass. It is also an ordinance of the sages that a blessing is to be recited after eating or drinking, provided that the quantity drunk is at least a quarter of a <italic>log</italic> (equal to the volume of an egg and a half), and the food eaten is at least as much as an olive in size. A cook who is tasting food does not need to recite a blessing before or after doing so, provided that the quantity tasted is less than a quarter of a <italic>log.</italic></p>
<p>3. And just as blessings are recited when partaking of material enjoyments, so when about to fulfill any precept, a blessing is said, after which the precept is performed. The sages have moreover instituted several blessings of praise and thanksgiving and petition, in order that when not partaking of material enjoyments nor engaged in the fulfillment of religious duties we should constantly have God in mind. All blessings accordingly fall into three kinds; blessings recited when partaking of material enjoyments, blessings recited when fulfilling religious duties, and blessings of thanksgiving, which have the character of praise, thanksgiving and supplication, and the purpose of which is that we should always have the Creator in mind and revere Him.</p>
<p>4. The forms of all the blessings were established by Ezra and his Court. It is not proper to vary them, or add to or take aught away from any one of them. Whoever deviates from the form which the Sages have given to the Blessings, is in error. Any blessing in which the name of God and His Sovereignty are not mentioned is not regarded as a blessing, unless it follows immediately another blessing.</p>
<p>5. All blessings may be recited in any language, provided that the form instituted by the sages is followed. And if the form has been changed, the duty of reciting the blessing is discharged, since the name of God and His sovereignty as well as the subject matter of the blessing have been mentioned, even though in a foreign tongue.</p>
<p>6. All blessings should be so recited that the reciter hears what he is saying. But if he has not recited the blessings so that he can hear them, he has nevertheless fulfilled his duty, whether he uttered them with his lips or recited them mentally.</p>
<p>7. There must be no interruption between the recital of any blessing and that for which it is recited. If such an interruption has taken place, the blessing must be repeated. If the interruption was in connection with matters appertaining to the blessing, the blessing need not be recited a second time. For example, a person recites the blessing over bread; and, before he eats it, says &#x201C;Bring salt&#x201D;, &#x201C;bring the cooked course&#x201D;, &#x201C;give food to So and So&#x201D;, &#x201C;Feed the cattle&#x201D;, he need not recite the blessing a second time. The same is the rule in similar cases.</p>
<p>8. All blessings may be recited by one ritually unclean, whether the uncleanness is of such a nature that he can free himself of it the same day or not. It is forbidden to a male to recite blessings while in a nude state.</p>
<p>9. Blessings, even when they have already been recited by a person in fulfillment of his obligation, may be said by him, a second time, on behalf of others who have not said them, so as to free them of their obligation. Blessings recited on partaking of refreshments, when this is not a religious duty, form an exception. A person may only recite the blessings on behalf of others, when he also partakes of the refreshment. But when the refreshment is also a religious duty, as, for instance, eating unleavened bread on the first nights of Passover, eating bread or drinking wine at the inauguration of Sabbath and Festival, a person may recite the blessings for others who eat and drink, without having to join them.</p>
<p>10. He who hears any blessing from beginning to end, with the intent to fulfill his obligation (to recite that blessing) has fulfilled his obligation, even if he has not responded &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;. Whoever responds Amen after a blessing has been said is in the same category with the reciter, provided that the latter was under the obligation of saying such a blessing. If the reciter&#x2019;s obligation was only Rabbinical, while the respondent&#x2019;s was Scriptural, the latter does not fulfill his duty unless he responds Amen or listens to the recital of the blessing by one who is under a scriptural obligation.</p>
<p>11. When several persons had agreed to eat bread or drink wine in company, and one of them recited the blessing, while all the rest responded &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;, they are permitted to eat and drink. If, however they had not intended to have a meal together but each came (without preconcerted arrangement) even though they should be eating of the same loaf, each of them recites the blessing for himself. This rule refers to bread and wine only. The consumption of other foods and beverages does not require an agreement to form one party. If any one of those present recites the blessing and the rest respond &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;, they may all eat and drink, even if originally they had had no intention to form one company.</p>
<p>12. Whoever hears an Israelite recite a blessing has to respond &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;, even if he has not heard the entire blessing from beginning to end, and even if he himself is not under an obligation to recite that blessing. If however the reciter was an idolater, a free thinker (Epikoros), a Samaritan, a child practising blessings, or an adult who deviated from the fixed form of the blessing, no response of Amen is made.</p>
<p>13. Whoever responds &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;, must not utter it with the first or last letter clipped, or unduly hurried or drawn out, but should utter it in the way it is ordinarily pronounced. He should not raise his voice above that of the reciter of the blessing. A person who is under an obligation to recite a blessing and has not heard it recited by another may not join the hearers in responding Amen.</p>
<p>14. Whoever recites a blessing unnecessarily takes the name of God in vain and is like one who swears in vain. After such a blessing it is forbidden to respond Amen. But children are taught the blessings in their regular form. Although while they are learning, they recite the blessings without due occasion, this is permitted. There must however be no response (of Amen) to such recitals, nor does any one who responds Amen discharge his obligation if he had occasion to recite such blessings.</p>
<p>15. Whoever responds Amen to the blessings which he himself says acts objectionably; but to add Amen to the last of concluding blessings is laudable; as, for instance, after the phrase, &#x201C;Who rebuildeth Jerusalem&#x201D; in the Grace after meals, or after the last of the blessings recited after the <italic>Shema</italic> in the Evening Service, or at the close of the concluding blessings the reciter responds Amen to his own recital of the blessings.</p>
<p>16. Why does one respond &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; to the blessing ending &#x201C;Who rebuildeth Jerusalem&#x201D;, seeing that it is followed by the benediction, &#x201C;Who is kind and dealeth kindly&#x201D;? Because this last named benediction was instituted in the times of the Sages of the Mishna, and is in the nature of a supplement, while the essential portion of the Grace after meals ends with the formula, &#x201C;Who rebuildeth Jerusalem.&#x201D; Why does one not respond &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; to the blessing beginning, &#x201C;With everlasting love&#x201D;? Because it is the conclusion of the blessings preceding the recital of the <italic>Shema.</italic> The rule is the same with all blessings said before any act; as, for instance those said before reading the Scroll of Esther or those said before kindling the Hanucah Lights, so that there should be no interruption between the recital of the blessings and the act for which the reciter said the blessings.</p>
<p>17. Why does one not add &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; to the blessing one has said on partaking of fruit etc.? Because it is a single blessing, and Amen is only added to a final blessing, when preceded by one or more blessings; for example, the blessings recited by the King or the High Priest,<xref rid="fn77">&#x002A;</xref> the addition of the Amen in these cases indicating that all the blessings had been completed.</p>
<p>18. Whoever eats forbidden food, wilfully or in error&#x2014;recites no blessing either before or after. For example, if one eats of that which is Rabbinically regarded as <italic>Tevel</italic> (produce from which priest&#x2019;s dues and Levite&#x2019;s tithes should have been, but had not been separated), or eats Levite&#x2019;s tithes from which the priest&#x2019;s dues (two per cent by the original owners, and ten per cent by the Levite of his portion) had not been taken, or eats (outside Jerusalem) Second tithes (which should be consumed in Jerusalem), or consumes that which had been set apart for the Sanctuary and had not been properly redeemed, he does not recite the blessings for the food. Needless it is to add that no blessing is recited if flesh is eaten of a beast that was not properly slain or was pronounced unfit for consumption by Jews owing to a lesion, or if wine is drunk that is forbidden to Jews etc.</p>
<p>19. But if one eats <italic>Demai</italic> (produce bought from those concerning whom it is doubtful whether they give the tithe), or of the Levite&#x2019;s tithe from which the priest&#x2019;s dues given by the Levite have been separated, but not the proportion of priest&#x2019;s dues, which should have been given by the original owner, provided that the Levite took his tithe while the grain was still in the ear, or of the Second Tithe, or of that which was devoted to the Sanctuary and has been redeemed, but without the addition of an extra fifth of the value&#x2014;in these, and all similar cases, the blessings, both before and after partaking of the food, are said.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. The order of the Grace after meals is as follows: The first blessing is that beginning &#x201C;Who feedeth&#x201D;; the second is the blessing for the Promised Land; the third, that ending &#x201C;Who rebuildeth Jerusalem&#x201D;; the fourth, that beginning &#x201C;Who is good and doeth good&#x201D;. The first blessing was instituted by Moses, our teacher; the second, by Joshua; the third, by David and Solomon, his son; the fourth, by the Sages of the Mishna.</p>
<p>2. Laborers when taking a meal during the time that they are working for an employer, do not recite the blessing before the meal, so that they may not neglect his work, and only recite two blessings after it. The first of these two blessings is recited in its regular form. The second begins with the blessing for the Promised Land, includes a reference to the blessing, &#x201C;Who will rebuild Jerusalem&#x201D; and ends with the concluding formula of the second blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art thou, O Lord, for the land and the food.&#x201D; If however the workmen&#x2019;s sole wage is their board, or if their employer takes the meal with them, they recite all the four blessings of the Grace after meals in their complete form as others do.</p>
<p>3. The blessing for the Promised Land must begin and end with thanksgiving and its concluding formula is &#x201C;for the land and for the food&#x201D;. Whoever omits in this blessing the phrase, &#x201C;a land, desirable, good and ample&#x201D; has not fulfilled his duty. The Abrahamic covenant and the Torah must also be mentioned in it. The reference to the Covenant must come first, since the covenant referred to in the benediction for the land is the rite of circumcision in connection with which there were thirteen covenants, while in connection with the Torah there were only three, as it is said, &#x201C;These are the words of the Covenant&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 28:69); &#x201C;beside the Covenant which He made with them in Horeb&#x201D; (ibid. 28:69); &#x201C;Ye stand this day &#x2026; that thou shouldst enter into the Covenant (ibid. 29:9-11).</p>
<p>4. The third blessing begins, &#x201C;Have mercy, O Lord our God, upon us and upon Israel, Thy people, and upon Jerusalem Thy city, and upon Zion, the abiding place of Thy glory&#x201D;; or &#x201C;Comfort us, O Lord our God, in Jerusalem, Thy city&#x201D;, and concludes, &#x201C;Who will rebuild Jerusalem&#x201D; or &#x201C;Who will comfort His people Israel in the rebuilding of Jerusalem&#x201D;. This benediction is accordingly styled &#x201C;Comfort&#x201D;. Whoever has not mentioned in it the Sovereignty of the House of David has not fulfilled his duty. For this constitutes the very essence of the blessing. Israel&#x2019;s consolation will only be a complete consolation when the House of David will be restored to Sovereignty.</p>
<p>5. On Sabbaths and Festivals, one begins [this blessing] and concludes it with Consolation, and includes a reference to the special holy character of the day. One begins, &#x201C;Comfort us, O Lord our God, in Zion Thy city&#x201D;; or &#x201C;Have mercy, O Lord our God upon Israel, Thy people, and upon Jerusalem, Thy city&#x201D;, and ends, &#x201C;Who comfortest Thy people Israel in the rebuilding of Jerusalem&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Who rebuildest Jerusalem&#x201D;. In the middle of the blessing one adds, &#x201C;O our God and God of our fathers, be pleased to fortify us by Thy commandments, and especially by the commandment of this great and holy seventh day, (since this day is great and holy before Thee<xref rid="fn78">&#x002A;</xref>), we will rest and repose thereon (in love<xref rid="fn78">&#x002A;</xref>) in accordance with the precept of Thy will. (In Thy favor, O Lord our God, grant us repose<xref rid="fn78">&#x002A;</xref>), and let there be among us no trouble, evil, sorrow nor sighing on the day of our rest&#x201D;. On the Festivals the formula beginning, &#x201C;May our remembrance rise and come&#x201D; is added in the third blessing, as also on the first day of the month and on the intermediate days of the festivals.</p>
<p>6. On the Feast of Lights and on the Feast of Lots, there is added in the blessing for the Promised Land the formula beginning, &#x201C;For the miracles&#x201D; which is inserted on these days in the <italic>Amidah</italic> prayer. When a festival or the first day of the month falls on a Sabbath, the paragraph beginning, &#x201C;Be pleased to fortify us&#x201D; is said first, and then that beginning, &#x201C;Let arise and come&#x201D;. So too, when the first day of the month of Tebeth falls on a Sabbath, the paragraph beginning, &#x201C;For the miracles&#x201D; is added in the blessing for the Promised Land and those respectively commencing, &#x201C;Be pleased to fortify us&#x201D; and &#x201C;let arise and come&#x201D; are added in the blessing for the comforting of Israel.</p>
<p>7. In the fourth blessing, the sovereignty of God must be mentioned three times. When there is a guest at table who recites Grace after the meal, he adds a blessing for the host, as follows: &#x201C;May it be the Supreme Will that the master of the house shall not suffer shame in this world nor be confounded in the world to come.&#x201D; The guest may add other blessings to this blessing for the host or expand it.</p>
<p>8. When Grace is said in the home of a mourner, the following is added in the fourth blessing: &#x201C;O living King who art kind and dealest kindly, true God and Judge Who judgest righteously and rulest in Thy world, doing therein according to Thy Will, Whose people and servants we are and Whom in all situations we have to thank and bless&#x201D;. The reciter of Grace then offers up a prayer at his discretion that the mourner shall be vouchsafed comfort, and continues, &#x201C;May the All-merciful etc.&#x201D;.</p>
<p>9. In the home of the newly wedded, the marriage blessing is recited at every meal after the four blessings of the Grace. This blessing is not recited by slaves nor by minors (those under thirteen years of age). For how long a period is it recited? When a widower marries a widow, it is recited on the first day only. When a bachelor marries a widow or a widower marries a spinster, it is recited during the seven days of the festivity (after the marriage).</p>
<p>10. The blessing which is added to the Grace in the bridegroom&#x2019;s home is the last of the seven marriage benedictions. And this rule applies if those at the meal attended the wedding and heard the blessings. But if there are other guests at the table who had not heard the blessings at the wedding ceremony, the seven blessings are recited for their sake, after Grace, provided however that a quorum of ten adult males is present, including the groom.</p>
<p>The following in brackets is omitted in the manuscript but included in the extant editions:</p>
<p>[11. The seven benedictions are as follows: Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast formed man. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast created all things to Thy glory. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast formed man in Thine image, after Thy likeness, and hast prepared unto him out of his very self a perpetual fabric; blessed art Thou, O Lord, Creator of man. May she who was barren (Zion) be exceedingly glad and exult when her children are gathered within her in joy; blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest Zion joyful through her children. O make these loved companions greatly to rejoice, even as of old Thou didst gladden Thy creature in the garden of Eden; blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest bridegroom and bride to rejoice. Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast created joy and gladness, bridegroom and bride, mirth and exultation, pleasure and delight, love, brotherhood, peace and fellowship. Soon may there be heard in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the jubilant voice of bridegrooms from their canopies and of youths from their feasts of song; blessed art Thou, O Lord, who makest the bridegroom to rejoice with the bride.] If, on Sabbath or Festival, a person forgot to recite in the Grace after meals, the paragraph referring to the special sanctity of the day, and became aware of the omission before he began the fourth blessing, he says, on Sabbath, &#x201C;Blessed be the Lord who has given rest to His people Israel, as a sign and holy covenant, blessed art Thou, O Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath&#x201D;.</p>
<p>12. And on festivals he says, &#x201C;Blessed be He who appointed feasts unto His people Israel for joy and gladness, blessed art Thou. O Lord who hallowest Israel and the festivals&#x201D;. He then begins the fourth blessing and continues to the end. If he only became aware of the omission after he had begun the fourth blessing, he stops and goes back to the beginning of the Grace, namely to the blessing for food.</p>
<p>13. If, on New Moons, one forgot to recite the paragraph beginning, &#x201C;Let arise and come&#x201D;, and became aware of the omission before beginning the fourth blessing, he says, &#x201C;Blessed is He who appointed New Moons unto His people Israel as a remembrance&#x201D; and does not conclude with any other formula, (Blessed art Thou, O Lord, etc.&#x201D; as on Sabbaths and Festivals) but begins the fourth blessing and continues to the end. If he became aware of the omission after he had begun the fourth blessing, he continues to the end and does not go back. So too, on the intermediate days of the festivals and on the Feast of Lights and the Feast of Lots, if he forgot and made no reference to the special character of the day he does not go back.</p>
<p>14. If one forgot to say Grace after a meal, and became aware of the omission before the meal was digested<xref rid="fn79">&#x002A;</xref> he goes back and recites Grace. Once the food has been digested, he does not go back to say Grace. So too, if he has forgotten whether he had said Grace or not, he recites it as long as the meal is not yet digested.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. There are five species of grain;&#x2014;wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. Spelt belongs to the wheat species; oats and rye belong to the barley species. As long as they are in the ear, these five species are everywhere called produce. After having been threshed and winnowed, they are termed grain. When they have been ground and the meal has been kneaded and baked, the product is called bread. The bread made of any of these species is everywhere styled bread without qualification.</p>
<p>2. Whoever eats bread has to recite before the meal the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who bringest forth bread from the earth&#x201D;; [and after the meal, the four blessings of the Grace after meals.<xref rid="fn80">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref>] If one eats grain, plainly boiled, he recites before the meal the blessing; <xref rid="fn81">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> &#x201C;&#x2026; Who createst the fruit of the earth&#x201D;, and after it, &#x201C;Who createst many living beings with their wants etc.&#x201D;. If one eats meal, he first recites the blessing &#x201C;by Whose word all things exist&#x201D;, and after he has eaten, &#x201C;Who createst many living beings&#x201D;.</p>
<p>3. Meal of any one of these five species of grain that had been boiled and then mixed with water or other fluids, if it is so thick that it can be eaten and masticated, requires, before it is eaten, the recital of the blessing, &#x201C;Who createst various kinds of foods,&#x201D; and after it is eaten, the recital of the blessing, &#x201C;For the sustenance and nourishment etc.&#x201D; If the gruel was so thin that it could only be drunk, the blessing before partaking of it is, &#x201C;by Whose word all things exist&#x201D;, and afterwards that beginning, &#x201C;Who createst many living beings&#x201D;.</p>
<p>4. If meal of one of these five species was boiled in a saucepan by itself, or mixed with other ingredients, as in the case of pancakes etc., or if grain was split or crushed and boiled in a saucepan as for example, groats or crushed early grain&#x2014;all of which are called pot-food,&#x2014;or if any one of these five species was mixed, either in the form of meal or bread with any cooked food, the blessing to be recited before partaking of it is &#x201C;Who createst different species of food.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. This only applies when this species of grain was regarded by the consumer as the chief constituent in the dish and not as an adjunct. But if one of the five species of grain that had been mixed with other ingredients was secondary, the consumer recites the blessing for the chief constituent of the dish and is freed from the obligation of uttering a blessing for the adjunct. For the general rule in the recital of blessings is that where a dish contained both a principal and a secondary constituent, the blessing is recited for the principal constituent, and this recital dispenses one from reciting a blessing for the adjunct, whether the latter was mixed with the former or not.</p>
<p>6. What is a mixed adjunct? For example, if turnip or cabbage is cooked, and meal of one of the five species of grain is added in the cooking to thicken the dish, the blessing &#x201C;Who created different species of foods&#x201D; is not recited, because the turnip or cabbage is the principal constituent while the meal is secondary. For everything added to a dish to give it thickness, fragrance or color, is adjunctory. What however is added to give savour [taste] to the mixture, is regarded as a chief constituent. Accordingly, when various kinds of honey are cooked together with the addition of starch to thicken the mixture in order to make sweetmeats, the blessing &#x201C;Who createst different species of food&#x201D; is not recited over the products, since the principal constituent is the honey.</p>
<p>7. What is an unmixed adjunct? If one needs to eat salt fish and eats bread with it, so that the salt should not injure his throat and tongue, he recites the blessing for the salty dish, and this dispenses him from the obligation of reciting the blessing for the bread, since the bread is an adjunct. The same rule applies to similar cases.</p>
<p>8. When bread is broken up and the pieces are cooked in a saucepan or kneaded together with the addition of broth, if there are some pieces of the size of an olive, or if they are recognizable as bread,&#x2014;their appearance being unchanged, the blessing before eating them is &#x201C;Who bringest forth bread from the earth&#x201D;. But if none of the pieces is of the size of an olive, or if they have completely lost the appearance of bread, the blessing before eating them is &#x201C;Who createst different species of food.&#x201D;</p>
<p>9. When dough is baked in the earth, as the Arabs who live in the desert bake it, the previous blessing is &#x201C;Who createst different kinds of food&#x201D;, the product riot having the appearance of bread. If one makes a meal of it, the blessing is &#x201C;Who bringest forth bread from the earth.&#x201D; So too when a dough is kneaded with honey, oil or milk, or mixed with different ingredients and then baked&#x2014;this is termed cake,&#x2014;the blessing, before eating it, is &#x201C;Who createst different kinds of food.&#x201D; But if one makes a meal of it, the blessing is &#x201C;Who bringest forth bread from the earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>10. When rice is cooked or bread is made of it, the blessing said before eating it is &#x201C;Who createst various kinds of food&#x201D;, and afterwards &#x201C;Who createst many living beings etc.&#x201D;&#x2014;provided however that the food is not mixed with anything else but is only rice. When bread is made of millet or other species of rice, the blessing recited before eating it is &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist&#x201D;, and afterwards &#x201C;Who createst many living beings etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>11. Any food for which the blessing &#x201C;Who bringest forth bread from the earth&#x201D; is first said, requires, after it is eaten, the recital of the full Grace after Meals with its four blessings. Any food for which the blessing &#x201C;Who createst different kinds of food&#x201D; is first said requires after the meal the Blessing which is an epitome of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals. Rice is an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>12. The above rules apply if the food consumed is as much [in size] as an olive, or more. But if the food eaten by an individual is less in volume than an olive&#x2014;whether it be bread or other food,&#x2014;or if the quantity drunk by a person is less than the fourth of a <italic>Log</italic>&#x2014;whether it be wine or other liquids, he first recites the blessing prescribed for the particular food or drink but says no blessing afterwards.</p>
<p>13. The Epitome of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals is as follows: &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, for the sustenance and for the nourishment, and for the desirable, good and ample land which Thou wast pleased to give as an heritage unto our fathers. Have mercy, O Lord our God, (upon us and upon Israel Thy people),<xref rid="fn82">&#x002A;</xref> upon Jerusalem Thy city, and upon Zion, the abiding-place of Thy glory. Lead us up thither and make us rejoice in its rebuilding.&#x201D;<xref rid="fn83">&#x002A;</xref> And we will bless Thee for it in holiness and purity. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, for the land and for the sustenance.&#x201D; On Sabbaths and Festivals a reference to the special sanctity of the day is added, as in the Grace after meals.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. The Grace after meals as well as the Single Blessing epitomizing its first three Blessings must be said in the place where the meal was taken. If a person ate, while walking, he should sit down at the spot where he finished his meal and say Grace. If one ate standing, he should sit down in the same place and say Grace. If he forgot to say the Grace after meals, and becomes aware of his omission before the meal is digested, he recites the Grace at the place where he becomes aware of it. If the omission was a wilful neglect, he has to return to the place where the meal was taken and there say Grace. Nevertheless, if the Grace was said in the place where he recalled the omission, he has fulfilled his duty. So too the duty is fulfilled if the Grace is said, standing or walking. But one should not deliberately say Grace or its Epitome otherwise than sitting down and in the place where the meal was taken.</p>
<p>2. If one is in doubt as to whether he said the blessing &#x201C;Who bringest forth bread etc.&#x201D; or not, he should not say it again, because this blessing is not prescribed in the Torah. But if one forgot to say this blessing and became aware of the omission before the completion of the meal, he says the blessing. If he only becomes aware of the omission after the meal was completed, he does not say it.</p>
<p>3. If a person began his meal in one apartment and interrupted it and went to another apartment or a friend called him while he was eating, wishing to speak to him, and he went to the door of his apartment, and in either of these cases returned to his place, he must, since he had moved from it, first say Grace for what he had eaten, and again repeat the blessing &#x201C;Who bringest forth bread&#x201D;, after which he completes his meal.</p>
<p>4. Friends who sat down to have a meal in company, and went out to greet a bridegroom or bride, if they left behind an old man or a sick man, they return to their places and complete their meal without having to say the preliminary blessing a second time. But if they left no one behind, they need, before going out, to say Grace for what they have eaten, and when they return, to say the blessing for the food they are about to eat.</p>
<p>5. The same is the rule with persons who form a drinking party or sit down to eat fruit together. Any one who leaves the place is regarded as having finished eating or drinking. He must therefore first say Grace for what he has already consumed and (when he comes back) again say the blessing for what he is about to eat or drink. But a person who changes his seat from one corner of the room to another need not repeat the blessing. If one began a meal on the east side of a fig-tree and then goes to the west side to continue the meal, he must say the preliminary blessing again.</p>
<p>6. If one said the blessing for the bread, this dispenses him from saying the blessing for the relish eaten with the bread, whether it be a cooked dish, fruit or similar things. But if he said the blessing for the relish, this does not dispense him from saying the blessing for the bread. If one said the blessing for cooked cereals, this dispenses him from the blessing for the soup, and if he said the blessing for the other cooked dish, this exempts him from saying the blessing for the cooked cereal.<xref rid="fn84">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>7. A person who intended to stop eating or drinking and then changed his mind and resolved to continue his meal, even if he has not moved from his place, has first to repeat the blessing (for what he is about to take). But if he has not made up his mind but intended, on the contrary, to resume the meal, he need not say the blessing a second time, even though the interruption lasted the whole day.</p>
<p>8. If a company drinking together said &#x201C;Come, let us say Grace&#x201D; or &#x201C;Come, let us say the Blessing for the Sanctification of the Day&#x201D; (i.e. inauguration of the incoming Sabbath or Festival), they are forbidden to continue drinking till they have said Grace or recited the Blessing for the Sanctification of the Day. But if, regardless of the prohibition, they wish to drink before saying Grace or the blessing for the Sanctification of the Day, (though they are forbidden to do so) they must first say the blessing &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the vine&#x201D; and then drink. But if they said &#x201C;Come let us say the Blessing for the conclusion of Sabbath or Festival,&#x201D; they need not, if they continue drinking, first say the blessing &#x201C;Who created the fruit of the vine.&#x201D;</p>
<p>9. If a company was drinking wine, and another kind of wine was brought them; for instance if they were drinking red wine and black wine was brought, or old wine and new wine was brought, they need not say the blessing for the wine a second time; but they say the blessing &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who is good and doeth good&#x201D;.</p>
<p>10. No blessing for any food or drink is said till it has been placed before the one who says the blessing. If he has already said the blessing and then the food or drink is brought to him, he must say the blessing a second time. If a person took food in his hand and said the blessing, and it dropped out of his hand and was burnt or swept away in the river, he takes another portion of food and says the blessing a second time even though the food be of the same kind. He also needs to recite the sentence &#x201C;Blessed be the name of His glorious sovereignty for ever and ever,&#x201D; so as to avoid the sin of having uttered God&#x2019;s name in vain. A person, standing by a water-course, says the blessing and drinks, although the draught of water which he drinks is not that which was before him at the moment when he said the blessing, since he had this in mind from the beginning.</p>
<p>11. Dishes served in the course of the meal and which are part of the meal need no blessing to be said before or after partaking of them. The blessing for bread at the beginning of the meal and the Grace at the end cover all these which are contributory to the meal. Dishes not part of the meal, but which are served in the course of the meal, require a blessing to be said before they are eaten but none afterwards. Dishes served after the meal is over, whether they belong to the meal or not, require a blessing to be said before they are eaten and a blessing afterwards.</p>
<p>12. On Sabbaths and festivals, as also at the meal eaten after blood-letting or after one has had a vapor-bath and on similar occasions, when wine is a principal part of the meal, a blessing recited for wine drunk before the meal exempts one from saying the blessing for wine drunk after the meal and before the recital of Grace. On other days however, he must recite the blessing for wine drunk after the meal. When wine is served during the meal, every one at the table says the blessing for himself; for the throat, engaged in swallowing the food, is not free to respond Amen. This blessing does not exempt the diners from saying the blessing for wine drunk after the meal.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>
<p>1. Women and slaves are also under the obligation of saying Grace after meals. It is doubtful however whether this obligation is imposed by the Torah, there being no set time for its fulfillment&#x2014;or whether it is one only imposed by the sages. Hence they cannot, by saying it, discharge male adults from their obligation. Boys (under 13) are under an obligation to say Grace after meals by an ordinance of the sages so that they may be trained in the observance of religious duties.</p>
<p>2. When three persons or more eat bread together, they have to say before the Grace a preliminary benedictory formula. If the company at table consisted of at least three and fewer than ten, one of them says &#x201C;We will bless Him of Whose bounty we have eaten&#x201D;. All the others respond &#x201C;Blessed be He of Whose bounty we have eaten and by Whose goodness we live.&#x201D; He then repeats &#x201C;Blessed be He of Whose bounty we have eaten and by Whose goodness we live.&#x201D; Then he begins &#x201C;Blessed art Thou O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who feedest the whole world with His goodness&#x201D; and continues to the end of the four Blessings,&#x2014;the others responding &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; after each blessing.</p>
<p>3. If the company at table consisted of ten or more, the introductory formula includes the name of God. The one who says Grace begins &#x201C;We will bless our God, of Whose bounty we have eaten.&#x201D; The others respond &#x201C;Blessed be our God, of Whose bounty we have eaten, and by Whose goodness we live.&#x201D; The leader then repeats &#x201C;Blessed be our God, of Whose bounty we have eaten, and by Whose goodness we live.&#x201D; And then he commences the Grace.</p>
<p>4. If one takes a meal at a bridegroom&#x2019;s table&#x2014;during the period extending from the time that preparations are begun for the requisites of the wedding banquet up to the expiry of thirty days after the marriage&#x2014;he introduces the Grace thus &#x201C;We will bless Him in Whose abode is joy, and of Whose bounty we have eaten.&#x201D; The others respond &#x201C;Blessed be He in Whose abode is joy and of Whose bounty we have eaten.&#x201D; If there were ten persons present, he says &#x201C;We will bless our God in Whose abode is joy, and of Whose bounty we have eaten.&#x201D; The others respond &#x201C;Blessed be our God in Whose abode is joy and of Whose bounty we have eaten.&#x201D; So too when a banquet is given in honor of the marriage within twelve months of its having taken place, the formula &#x201C;in Whose abode is joy&#x201D; is used.</p>
<p>5. All are under the obligation of reciting the introductory benedictory formula, just as they are under an obligation to say Grace after meals. This applies also to priests partaking of holiest food in the Courtyard of the Temple. On the same principle also, when priests and ordinary Israelites are eating in company, the former partaking of the heave-offerings, the latter of unconsecrated food, they are all under the obligation of reciting the Introductory Benedictory formula before Grace.</p>
<p>6. Women, slaves and minors are not eligible for the quorum required for the introductory formula. But they recite it when they are by themselves. However, to prevent licentiousness, women, slaves and minors should not be formed into a joint company for Grace. But women may form a quorum for themselves, and so may slaves. In either case they do not use the name of God in the introductory formula. An androgyne recites the introductory formula if the entire company is of his class, but not if the other members are normal men and women. One whose sex cannot be determined never says the introductory formula. A minor if he is only seven or eight years of age, provided he understands Who it is that is addressed in benediction, may be counted in the quorum, whether it consists of three or ten persons. A non-Israelite is not to be counted.</p>
<p>7. That person only may be counted who ate bread at least as much as the size of an olive. If seven of a company ate bread while the other three ate vegetables or partook of juice, etc. they all join for Grace and insert the name of God in the introductory formula, provided that the one who says Grace is of those who ate bread. But if six ate bread while four partook of vegetables, they do not form a quorum of ten, because for such a quorum there must be an easily recognizable majority of those who ate bread. This rule applies to a quorum of ten. But to constitute a quorum of three, each of the party must have eaten bread as much as the size of an olive, and in such a case they recite the introductory formula.</p>
<p>8. If two persons were eating together and after they had concluded their meal, a third person joined them, they may form a quorum, provided that the first two could eat with him, however little it might be, and even if it were different food. The greatest scholar in the company says Grace, even though he arrived last.</p>
<p>9. Where three persons have eaten together, they may not separate for Grace. The same is the rule with four or five. A company of six however (less than ten) may divide for Grace into two groups. When there are ten or more in the company, they may not separate for Grace till they are twenty; for fellow-diners may only separate themselves into groups, when each group is sufficiently large to qualify for the recital of the same introductory formula as would be recited if they continued to be all together.</p>
<p>10. When three men, belonging to three distinct groups at table, each of which consisted of three individuals come together, they may not separate for Grace. But if each of these had already joined in the Introductory formula, they may say Grace separately, and are not under an obligation to form a new group, they having done so once already. When three men take their meals at one table, even though each of them eats of his own bread, they may not separate for Grace, but are to say Grace together as a group with the Introductory formula.</p>
<p>11. If two companies have a meal in the same house and some in each company can see those in the other company, they all form one group for Grace. Should this not be the case, each company says Grace for itself. If they are all served by one waiter who goes from one company to the other, they say Grace together, even if they do not see each other. It is essential however that every word uttered by the one who says Grace should be heard distinctly by both companies.</p>
<p>12. If three persons had their meals in company and one went out into the street, the other two call to him to attend to what they will say. They then count him in the quorum, though he is in the street, and he too discharges his obligation to join in the Grace. When he returns home, he must say Grace for himself. But when ten persons had their meals together and one of them went out into the street, they do not count him in the quorum of ten till he has returned and is seated in his place.</p>
<p>13. If three persons ate together, and one of them anticipated the others and said Grace for himself, the others may still count him in their quorum of three, and have fulfilled their duty, but he has not done so since the obligation of saying Grace in a group cannot be discharged retroactively.</p>
<p>14. If two persons had their meals together, each of them says Grace for himself. If one knew the Grace while the other did not know it, the former recites it aloud and the latter responds &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; after each blessing and thus fulfills his duty. A son may in this way recite Grace on his father&#x2019;s behalf; a slave for his master; a wife for her husband. But the sages say &#x201C;A curse will befall one whose wife or child recites the Grace for him.&#x201D;</p>
<p>15. It is however to be noted that these persons are only discharged of their obligation if they partook of a meal and their hunger is not satisfied. In this case the obligation to say Grace is one imposed by the dicta of the Scribes, and can therefore be fulfilled on their behalf by a minor, slave or woman. But if one has eaten and is satisfied, the duty to say Grace is Scriptural and cannot be discharged on his behalf by a woman, minor or slave, on the principle that anyone who is under an obligation imposed by the Torah can only be discharged of it by one upon whom the Torah imposes the same obligation.</p>
<p>16. When a person joins a company at the time when they are beginning the Introductory formula to the Grace, the rule is as follows: If he enters at the moment when the leader who says Grace utters the sentence &#x201C;Let us bless etc.&#x201D;, he responds &#x201C;Blessed be He and blessed be His name for ever and ever.&#x201D; Should he enter when the company is responding &#x201C;Blessed be He of Whose bounty we have partaken,&#x201D; he responds &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI.</h1>
<p>1. When one eats that kind of bread, the blessing for which is &#x201C;Who bringest forth bread from the earth&#x201D;, he must wash his hands before and after the meal. Even if it is unconsecrated bread and his hands are free from dirt and he is not aware of any uncleanliness attaching to them, he should not eat till he has washed his hands. Similarly any food that is dipped in liquids requires previous washing of the hands.</p>
<p>2. When washing the hands, whether for a meal or for the recital of the Shema or the <italic>Amidah</italic> prayer, one first says the blessing &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us by Thy commandments and given us command concerning the washing of the hands&#x201D;. For this is an ordinance of the sages whose instructions the Torah bids us heed, as it is said &#x201C;According to the law which they shall teach thee&#x2019; (Deut. 17-11). The washing of the hands after a meal requires no blessing, since it was only instituted as a precautionary measure against danger to health.<xref rid="fn85">&#x002A;</xref> Special attention should, on this account, be paid to the observance.</p>
<p>3. Washing of the hands between the courses is permissive; a person may wash or refrain from doing so, as he pleases. Fruit that is unconsecrated does not require washing of the hands either before or after being eaten; and anyone who washes his hands for fruit belongs to the class of the arrogant. All bread that has salt in it requires washing of the hands at the end of the meal, for it may contain Salt of Sodom<xref rid="fn86">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> or salt with similar properties, and a person after eating such bread may pass his hands over his eyes and lose his sight. Hence the obligation to wash the hands at the end of each meal, on account of the salt. Soldiers in camp are dispensed from the duty of washing their hands before meals as their minds are preoccupied. But they are under the obligation of washing their hands after meals as a precaution against risk to health.</p>
<p>4. How far up must the hands be washed? Up to the wrist. How much water should be used? A quarter (of a <italic>log</italic>) for both hands. Whatever substances are regarded as preventing the water from coming in contact with the body, when bathing in a ritual bath, are also so regarded in washing the hands.<xref rid="fn87">&#x002A;</xref> Whatever may serve to make up the measure of water required in a ritual bath<xref rid="fn88">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> will also serve for the fourth of a <italic>log</italic> requisite for washing the hands.</p>
<p>5. If a person who has to wash his hands dipped them into the water of a ritual bath,&#x2014;this is sufficient. But if he dipped them in a quantity of water less than that required for a ritual bath or in water that had been drawn forth from the ritual bath even if it is now in (a hollow of) the ground, his act is ineffective. For water that is drawn forth is only regarded as cleansing the hands, if poured on them.</p>
<p>6. A person washing his hands must have regard to four things: as to the water, that it should not be unfit for washing the hands; as to the quantity, that there should be the fourth of a <italic>log</italic> for each pair of hands; as to the vessel, that the water used for washing the hands should be in a vessel; and as to the person who washes the hands, that the pouring of the water should result directly from the exercise of human effort.</p>
<p>7. Four circumstances render water unfit for washing the hands,&#x2014;change in color, exposure, previous use, and deterioration to an extent that would prevent cattle drinking of it. If water has changed in color, whether it is contained in a vessel or kept in the ground and whether the change was caused by a substance dropped into the water, or is due to its situation, it is unfit for washing the hands. So also, if it has been subjected to such an exposure as would prohibit its being used for drinking, it is unfit for washing the hands.</p>
<p>8. Water used in work becomes waste and is unfit for washing the hands. For example, water in which one washed utensils or dipped his bread, etc., whether the water is in vessels or in the ground is unfit for washing the hands. But if one rinses in it utensils that have been washed or that are new, he does not render it unfit. The water in which the baker dips the loaves is unfit for washing the hands; but that from which he fills his hands while kneading is fit, because only the water in his hands is regarded as having been used, but not the water left in the vessel from which he filled his hands.</p>
<p>9. Any water, unfit for a dog to drink, e.g. water that is so bitter, salty, muddy or malodorous that a dog will not drink it, is unfit for washing the hands, if contained in vessels. As long as it is in the ground, it is fit for ritual bathing. While the hot waters of Tiberias are in their natural situation, the hands may be immersed in them. But if one has drawn off some of it in a vessel, or diverted it by a channel to another situation, it may not be used for washing the hands before or after a meal because it is unfit for an animal to drink.</p>
<p>10. A person washing his hands should pour the water on his hands little by little, till the prescribed quantity has been used. If the entire quarter of a <italic>log</italic> has been poured forth at once, this too is a correct lavation. Four or five persons may wash at the same time, their hands being adjacent or above each other, provided that the hands are kept loose, so that the water can pass between, and provided also that the quantity of water used amounts to a quarter of a <italic>log</italic> for each person.</p>
<p>11. The hands are not to be washed with water contained either in the sides of broken vessels or in the bottom of a cask, or in potsherds, or in the spigot of a cask. If however the spigot was specially fashioned for washing the hands, it may be so used. So too a skin bottle that has been adapted for the purpose (hollowed out to contain the requisite quantity), may be used for washing the hands. A sack or basket even if specially adapted may not be used for washing the hands, because they cannot hold the water.</p>
<p>One should not hand water in one&#x2019;s palm to another person for washing the hands, for one&#x2019;s palms are not a vessel. Vessels broken to an extent that would free them of ritual defilement are not to be used for washing the hands, since they are fragments.</p>
<p>12. All kinds of vessels may be used for washing the hands, even those made of dung or of earth, provided that they are whole. A vessel which does not hold a quarter of a <italic>log</italic> or which at the time does not actually contain that quantity of water is not to be used for washing the hands.</p>
<p>13. Anyone, even a deaf-mute, idiot or minor, is qualified to pour water on a person&#x2019;s hands for ritual washing. If no one else is present, the person washing his hands places the vessel between his knees and so causes the water to flow upon the hands or tilts the cask above his hands and so washes them, or holding the vessel in each hand alternately, washes the other. An ape may be employed for pouring the water.</p>
<p>14. In the case of a trough, filled by hand or by means of a wheel, from which the water passes into a trench to irrigate growing vegetables or to water cattle; if a person puts his hands in the trough and the water passes over them and rinses them, this does not constitute a ritual washing of the hands. But if they were held close to the place where the bucket empties the water into the trough, so that the waters flow over the hands as the direct effect of the action of the man who poured the water into the trough, it is accounted a ritual washing.</p>
<p>15. When one is in doubt whether the water he used in washing his hands had been previously used or not, whether it had been of the prescribed quantity or not, whether it was ritually clean or not, or is in doubt whether he had washed his hands or not, the decision is that he is ritually clean, because any doubt that arises as to the ritual cleanliness of the hands is resolved in a favorable sense.</p>
<p>16. In washing before a meal, the hands should be raised, so that the water, after reaching the wrist, may not flow back and render the hands unclean. In washing after a meal, the hands should be lowered so that every trace of salt should be removed from them. The washing of the hands before a meal may take place above (into) a vessel or on the ground. But after a meal the washing must be above (into) a vessel. The water used for washing before a meal may be made hot by fire, or be cold. But for washing after a meal, hot water may not be taken, that is, water sufficiently hot to scald the hands; for in such a case the grubbiness of the hands would not be removed since in water of that temperature, the hands cannot be rubbed. If however the water was tepid, it may be used for washing the hands after a meal.</p>
<p>17. A person may wash his hands in the morning and make a condition with himself that this shall be the ablution for the entire day, and then he need not wash his hands for each meal&#x2014;provided however that he does not allow his mind to become at any time oblivious of the intent to keep his hands clean. Should he have become oblivious, he has to wash his hands each time when this would ordinarily be required.</p>
<p>18. A person may wrap his hands in a napkin and eat bread or other food that is dipped in a liquid, even if he had not washed his hands. An individual, feeding another individual, need not wash his hands. But the one fed has to wash his hands, even if another individual puts the food into his mouth while he does not touch it. Likewise a person who uses a fork has to wash his hands.</p>
<p>19. It is forbidden to feed any one who has not washed his hands, even if the food is put into the person&#x2019;s mouth. It is forbidden to treat the rite of washing the hands as a matter of slight importance. The sages have many ordinances and exhortations on this subject. Even if a person has only enough water for drinking, he should use part of it to wash his hands, take his meal, and drink the rest of the water.</p>
<p>20. The hands are to be dried first and then the meal is to be begun. To eat without having dried one&#x2019;s hands is the same as partaking of bread that is unclean. Anyone who washes his hands after a meal dries them and then says Grace. Immediately after washing the hands, Grace should follow without interruption. After having washed the hands at the close of a meal, it is forbidden even to drink water till Grace has been recited.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>
<p>1. The Sages of Israel observed many customs at meals&#x2014;all of them, rules of good manners. They are as follows: When the meal is to be taken, the senior in the company washes his hands first; then they enter the room and take their seats and sit in a reclining posture. The senior reclines at the head of the room, the next most distinguished below him. If there are three couches, the most distinguished occupies one at the head of the room, the person next in degree occupies the couch above this; the person third in rank below it.<xref rid="fn89">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>2. The host recites the blessing &#x201C;Who bringest forth bread from the earth,&#x201D; concludes it and cuts the bread. A guest recites Grace after meals so that he may pronounce a benediction on the host. If there is no host, the senior in the company cuts the bread and also says Grace after meals.</p>
<p>3. The one who cuts the bread may not do so till salt or a relish has been placed before every one at the table&#x2014;unless they propose to eat dry bread. He is not to cut a small size because this would make him seem parsimonious, nor a slice larger than the size of an egg for then he would seem ravenous. On Sabbath a large slice is cut. The bread is to be cut only at the part where it has been thoroughly baked.</p>
<p>4. The most preferable way is to cut a whole loaf. If there is a whole loaf of barley bread and there is also a cut loaf of wheaten bread, the host puts the whole loaf within the cut loaf and divides them both, so that he cuts the wheaten bread and at the same time the whole loaf. On Sabbaths and Festivals, it is obligatory to say the blessing over two loaves. The host takes both loaves in his hand and cuts one of them.</p>
<p>5. The individual who cuts the loaf places a slice before everyone at table; and a slice he takes in his hand. He does not put the bread into the hand of anyone except that of a mourner. The person who cuts the bread helps himself first and begins to eat. Those at the table may not taste of any dish till the person who has said the blessing over the bread, has tasted first. He may not however begin to eat till the sound of the &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; uttered by the majority of those present has ceased. If he desires to show courtesy to his teacher or to his superior in learning by permitting him to help himself first, he is at liberty to do so.</p>
<p>6. Two having a meal together, in partaking of the successive dishes, wait for each other; but three do not need to do so. If two of them have completed their meal, the third pauses for grace. If one has finished, the other two do not pause, but continue their meal, till they have completed it. No conversation takes place during a meal, to avoid the risk (of choking). Hence, when wine is served in the course of the meal, every one at table says the blessing for himself; for if one were to say the blessing, and another responded &#x201C;Amen&#x201D; while swallowing, he might be in danger of choking. Nor may one stare at a person while he is eating, or at his portion of food, so as not to embarrass him.</p>
<p>7. The waiter who serves those at table does not join them in the meal. But it is kindly to put into his mouth a morsel of every dish so as to quiet his mind. If wine is offered him, he says the blessing for each cup separately, for his drinking does not depend on his volition but on the good will of those at table.</p>
<p>8. If one of the diners left the room, to relieve himself, he washes one hand and re-enters. If he was engaged in conversation, and was away a considerable time, he washes both hands before rejoining his companions. If they formed a drinking party, he enters the room, resumes his seat, washes his hands and then turns his face to the guests. Why does he wash his hands when he is in his place? Lest they say that, as no food is being consumed, he has not washed his hands.</p>
<p>9. Raw meat is not to be put on bread. A full cup of wine is not to be passed over bread. A dish should not be supported with a slice (or loaf) of bread. Bread must not be thrown. Nor should this be done with pieces of food, or with food that is without a shell, such as mulberries, grapes, figs, because they are thus rendered nauseous. Wine may be drawn through pipes in houses where wedding festivities are taking place. Parched corn and nuts may be flung in front of a bridal couple, but only in summer and not in winter, for then they would become nauseous. The hands may not be washed in wine, whether it be pure or diluted. So too no kind of food or drink may be spoilt by being handled contemptuously or roughly.</p>
<p>10. Guests may not take of the food put before them and give it to the host&#x2019;s son or daughter For the host would be ashamed if it was to be that which he had put before his guests and it turned out that the children had taken it. One may not send to his friend a cask of wine with oil floating on its surface. For the latter may have received another cask containing wine only; and under the impression that the former cask contains oil, will invite guests to a meal and be put to shame. Similarly any procedure of a like character which might bring shame to a host is forbidden.</p>
<p>11. After the guests have ended the meal, the table is removed, the floor is swept at the place where they have eaten, after which they wash their hands. For there might have been crumbs on the floor, the size of an olive, on which one may not step and over which one may not wash. Crumbs less than the size of an olive may be destroyed with the hands.</p>
<p>12. When water has been brought for washing the hands, the person who is to say Grace after meals washes first, so that he, the senior, shall not sit with unclean hands till another has washed. His companions at tables then wash their hands, one after another, without regard to order of precedence. This courtesy is not observed in washing the hands, nor in crossing bridges nor when walking on roads but only when passing through a door which requires a <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> and then only when entering.</p>
<p>13. After the washing and drying of the hands has been completed and Grace said and the fumigator of sweet spices brought in, the person who said Grace recites the blessing for the fumigatory compound, and the others present respond &#x201C;Amen&#x201D;.</p>
<p>14. If there is wine, a cup holding a quarter [of a <italic>log</italic>] or more, is brought together with spices. The person who is to say Grace takes the wine in his right hand and the spices in his left, and recites Grace after meals, then says the blessing for the wine and lastly the blessing for the spices. If the spices are in the form of a fragrant oil or something similar, he smears the head of the waiter with it. Should the latter be a scholar, he daubs it on the wall, so that the latter should not go out into the street smelling of perfume.</p>
<p>15. Although wine is not indispensable for Grace after meals, still if it is said with wine, according to the custom mentioned, it is necessary that the cup used for Grace should first be washed within and rinsed without, and then filled with pure wine. When the second blessing&#x2014;that for the holy land is reached, a little water is poured into the cup so that the contents may be pleasant to drink. After the Cup for Grace is on the table, there must be no conversation. But all remain silent till the Grace after meals and the blessing for the wine have been said, and then they drink.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VIII.</h1>
<p>1. Before partaking of fruits of trees, the blessing is said, &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the tree;&#x201D; and after these are consumed, &#x201C;Who createst many living beings and their wants.&#x201D; The five species of fruit mentioned in the Torah, namely, grapes, pomegranates, figs, olives and dates form an exception. After partaking of any of these, the blessing said is the single blessing which is a summary of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals. For fruit that grows on the ground as also for green vegetables, the blessing before they are eaten is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the earth&#x201D;, and the subsequent blessing is &#x201C;Who createst many living beings etc.&#x201D;. For food that does not belong to the vegetable kingdom such as flesh, cheese, fish, eggs, water, milk, honey and similar things, the blessing before partaking of any of them is &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist&#x201D;; and the subsequent blessing is &#x201C;Who createst many living beings etc.&#x201D;. A person drinking water, but not to quench his thirst, does not require to say a blessing before or after.</p>
<p>2. If a person squeezes fruit and extracts its juice he says the blessing before he drinks it, &#x201C;By Whose word, all things exist,&#x201D; and afterwards, the blessing &#x201C;Who createst many living beings&#x201D;&#x2026;. Grapes and olives form an exception to this rule. The blessing before drinking wine is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the vine&#x201D;; and afterwards the blessing which is a summary of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals. The blessing before drinking olive oil is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the tree.&#x201D; Such is the rule only if a person suffers from sore throat and drinks oil mixed with thin gruel, and similar things. For he receives specific benefit from drinking it. But if he drinks the oil by itself or is not suffering from a sore throat, he says the blessing &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist,&#x201D; since he derived no specific benefit from the taste of the oil.</p>
<p>3. For fruits or vegetables, usually eaten raw, if they have been boiled or scalded, the blessing before they are consumed is &#x201C;By Whose word, all things exist,&#x201D; and after they have been eaten, &#x201C;Who createst many living beings.&#x201D; &#x2026; For vegetables like cabbages and turnips that are usually eaten cooked, the blessing first said if they are eaten raw, is &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist&#x201D;, and the blessing said, after they are consumed, is &#x201C;Who createst many livng beings.&#x201D; &#x2026; When they are boiled, or steeped in hot water, the blessing before eating them is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the earth,&#x201D; and the blessing after is &#x201C;Who createst many living beings.&#x201D; &#x2026; For foods eaten either raw or cooked, the blessing appropriate to them is said before partaking of them in either state. If it is fruit that grows on a tree, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the tree&#x201D;; if fruit that grows on the ground, &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the earth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>4. Where vegetables customarily steeped in boiling water, have been so treated, the blessing before drinking the liquid is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the earth; provided that when steeping the vegetable there was an intent that the liquid should be drunk. For where it is customary to drink the liquid it is like the steeped food. The blessing before partaking of date honey is &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist.&#x201D; But for dates crushed by hand, the stones removed, and fashioned into a dough-like mass, the preliminary blessing is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the tree&#x201D; and the blessing, after eating of it, is the summary of the first three blessings of the Grace after meals.</p>
<p>5. The juice pressed out of the sweet canes and boiled till it coagulates and crystallizes like salt, requires, according to all the <italic>Geonim,</italic> the blessing &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the earth.&#x201D; Some hold that the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the tree.&#x201D; I hold that this is not a fruit, and the only blessing to be said is &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist,&#x201D; since the honey (sugar) extracted from these canes and changed by fire is not of more consequence than date honey which has undergone no such transformation by fire and for which the blessing is &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist.&#x201D;</p>
<p>6. For the palm stalk, that is, the top growth of the palm tree which looks like white wood, the preliminary blessing is &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist.&#x201D; For the caperflower-buds, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the earth,&#x201D; because it is not fruit. For caper berries, i.e. its fruit, which have the appearance of small thin dates, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the tree.&#x201D;</p>
<p>7. For pepper and ginger in their fresh state, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the earth.&#x201D; When dry, they require no blessing either before or after they are eaten, as they are spice and not food. Thus also, provisions not suitable for food and fluids not fit for drink require no blessing before or after they are consumed.</p>
<p>8. As to bread that has turned mouldy, wine that has become filmy, a cooked dish that has lost its characteristic appearance, windfall fruit that has lost its taste, beet, vinegar, locusts, salt, mushrooms,&#x2014;for any of these, the blessing is &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist.&#x201D; Whenever this blessing is recited before partaking of food, the blessing &#x201C;Who createst many living beings and their wants&#x201D; &#x2026; is said afterwards. And whatever requires a blessing afterward, requires a preliminary blessing.</p>
<p>9. When three measures of water were poured on lees of wine and four measures of fluid were drawn off, the blessing for drinking it is &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the vine-tree&#x201D;&#x2014;it being regarded as diluted wine. But if less than four measures were drawn off, the blessing before partaking of it is &#x201C;By Whose word everything exists.&#x201D;</p>
<p>10. If, before partaking of fruit that grows on a tree, a person said the blessing &#x201C;Who createst the fruits of the earth,&#x201D; he has fulfilled his duty. If, for fruit that grows on the ground, a person said the blessing, &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the tree,&#x201D; he has not fulfilled his duty. If, before partaking of any food, including even bread or wine, a person said &#x201C;By Whose word everything exists&#x201D;, he has fulfilled his duty.</p>
<p>11. If a person took a cup of strong drink<xref rid="fn90">&#x002A;</xref> in his hand and began the blessing with the intent to say &#x201C;By Whose word all things exist&#x201D;, but by mistake said &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the vine&#x201D;, he is not required to repeat the correct blessing. So, too, if one had fruit growing on the ground before him, and began the blessing with the intent to say &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the earth&#x201D;, but by mistake said &#x201C;Who createst the fruit of the tree&#x201D;, he is not required to repeat the correct blessing. So too, if a person has before him a dish of cereal and began the blessing intending to say &#x201C;Who createst different kinds of food&#x201D; and by mistake said &#x201C;Who bringest forth bread from the earth&#x201D; he has fulfilled his duty; because when he uttered the name of God and declared His sovereignty he had no other intent than to say the blessing appropriate to the particular kind of food before him; and since there was no error in the essential portion of the blessing, he fulfilled his duty, notwithstanding that he made a mistake in its conclusion, and is not required to repeat the correct blessing.</p>
<p>12. In regard to all these blessings, if one is in doubt whether he has said any of them or not, he does not repeat them, irrespective of whether it is recited before or after [partaking of food], since these blessings have all been ordained by the Scribes. Should one have forgotten and put food into his mouth without having previously said the blessing, he swallows it if it is a liquid and then says the blessing. Should it be fruit like mulberries or grapes, which, removed from the mouth, would be unpleasant to eat, he moves it to one side of the mouth, says the blessing and then swallows it. If the food is such that it would not become nauseous if removed from the mouth, e.g. beans and pulse, he removes it, says the blessing with his mouth free and then eats it.</p>
<p>13. When one has several kinds of food before him, and the blessing is the same for each of them, he says the blessing before partaking of one kind, this exempting him from repeating the blessing for the others. If however the blessings vary, he says the blessing appropriate to each kind, and may begin the meal with whichever dish he pleases. If he has no preference and there is on the table any one of the seven fruits indigenous to the Holy Land, he says the blessing over it first. Among these seven, that first mentioned in the Biblical verse is to be preferred. The seven fruits are those named in the text: &#x201C;A land of wheat, barley, vine, fig, pomegranate, a land of olive oil and honey&#x201D; (Deut. 8:8). The honey here referred to, is the honey of dates. Dates have the preference over grapes, because dates are mentioned in the text second after the word &#x201C;land&#x201D; (in the second part of the verse), while grapes come third after that word (in the first half of the verse).</p>
<p>14. The blessing summarizing the first three blessings of the Grace after Meals and which is recited after partaking of any of the five species of fruit (mentioned in the previous paragraph), or after drinking wine, is that said after eating cereal dishes made of any of the five species of grain. With this difference, that after partaking of the fruits the opening formula is &#x201C;for the tree and the fruit of the tree, for the produce of the field, for the desirable good and ample land etc.;&#x201D; while after drinking wine, one says &#x201C;for the vine and the fruit of the vine; the concluding phrase in both cases being &#x201C;for the land and its fruits.&#x201D; Some add to this summary before its conclusion a sentence as follows &#x201C;for Thou art a God who is good and beneficent&#x201D; as the gist of the fourth blessing of the Grace. Others hold that the fourth blessing was ordained exclusively as a part of the full Grace after Meals.</p>
<p>15. If a person has at one meal, drunk wine, eaten dates, and consumed cereals made of any of the five species of grain, he says as follows: &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, for the sustenance and the nourishment, for the vine and the fruit of the vine, for the tree and the fruit of the tree, for the produce of the field, for the desirable land etc.&#x201D;, and concludes &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, for the land, for the sustenance and for the fruits&#x201D;.</p>
<p>16. But if one ate meat and drank wine, he says a separate subsequent blessing for each. If one ate figs, grapes, apples, pears and similar things, he says afterwards the Summary of the Grace, the formula of which covers them all since they are all fruits of trees. The same principle applies to similar cases.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IX.</h1>
<p>1. Just as a person is forbidden to partake of food or drink without first saying a blessing, so it is forbidden to enjoy a fragrant odor without a previous blessing. What blessing is said for a fragrant odor? If the odoriferous substance was wood or something that comes from wood,<xref rid="fn91">&#x002A;</xref> the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst fragrant trees.&#x201D; If it was a herb, or something that comes from a herb, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst fragrant herbs&#x201D;. If it was neither wood nor a herb, as for instance musk which comes from a wild beast, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst diverse kinds of spices.&#x201D; If it was an edible fruit, such as a citron or an apple, the blessing is &#x201C;Who givest a goodly scent to fruits.&#x201D; If for any of these things, one said &#x201C;Who createst diverse kinds of spices,&#x201D; he has fulfilled his duty.</p>
<p>2. The blessing for incense is not recited till its smoke ascends. What blessing is said for it? If the substance which is burnt and gives forth an odor is of wood, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst fragrant trees.&#x201D; If it is a herb,&#x2014;&#x201C;Who createst fragrant herbs.&#x201D; If it is an animal substance or something similar, the blessing said is &#x201C;Who createst diverse kinds of spices.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3. For balsam oil and similar substances, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst sweet-smelling oil.&#x201D; But for oil of olives pressed or ground with fragrant species of wood till it emits a fragrant odor, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst spicy plants.&#x201D; For oil made fragrant with sweet-smelling essences like the oil of anointment, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst diverse kinds of spices.&#x201D; When oil and a branch of myrtle are brought at the same time, the blessing is said for the myrtle, and this exempts one from the obligation of saying a blessing for the oil,&#x2014;the same blessing being said for both, namely, &#x201C;Who createst fragrant plants.&#x201D;</p>
<p>4. If one has a perfume derived from a tree and one that is herbaceous, a blessing said for one does not discharge the obligation of saying a blessing for the other; a blessing must be said for each separately. If wine and fragrant oil are brought to a person at the same time, he takes the wine in the right hand and the oil in the left, says the blessing for the wine and drinks it, and then the blessing for the oil and smells it, and dabs the head of the waiter with it.&#x201D;<xref rid="fn92">&#x002A;</xref> If the waiter is a scholar, he dabs it on the wall.</p>
<p>5. When it is doubtful whether a fragrant substance is derived from a tree or herb, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst diverse kinds of spices.&#x201D; For a perfume compounded by a druggist and consisting of several spices, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst diverse kinds of spices.&#x201D; When one enters a perfumery store which contains many varieties of sweet scents, he says the blessing &#x201C;Who createst diverse kinds of spices.&#x201D; Should he stay there the whole day, he says the blessing once only. If he goes in and out he says it each time that he enters.</p>
<p>6. For the rose and spikenard, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst fragrant plants.&#x201D; For lilies of the garden the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst fragrant plants;&#x201D; for lilies of the field, &#x201C;Who createst odorous herbs.&#x201D; For the rhododendron, rose water, frankincense, mastic, or similar substances, the blessing is &#x201C;Who createst fragrant plants.&#x201D;</p>
<p>7. There are three classes of perfumes for which no blessing is said: a perfume which it is forbidden to smell, a perfume, the purpose of which is to remove a foul odor, and a perfume that had not been manufactured for the purpose of being smelt.</p>
<p>8. Examples: For perfumes used in idolatry, or by women within the prohibited degrees, no blessing is said, since the fragrance may not be inhaled. For perfumes placed near the remains of the dead, or in a lavatory, or oils used to remove unpleasant exhalations from the body, no blessing is said, as their purpose is to remove a foul odor. No blessing is said for a fumigating material used to fumigate vessels or apparel, for it is not used for the purpose of itself being smelt. So too, one who smells garments that have been fumigated says no blessing, as they contain no odorous substance but only an odor without substance.</p>
<p>9. No blessing is said for perfumes in a company of idolaters as the presumptive purpose of such an assemblage is idolatrous worship. A person walking outside a city, smells a fragrant odor. If the majority of the inhabitants of that city are idolaters, he does not say a blessing; if the majority are Israelites, he says a blessing. If a perfume for which a blessing should be said is mingled with one for which it is not said, the predominant odor decides as to whether it should or should not be said.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER X</h1>
<p>1. Other blessings and many other utterances without [the formal] introduction or conclusion have been ordained by the sages by way of praise and thanks, offered to the Holy God, blessed be He, in the same way as they ordained the blessings in the liturgy previously set forth. These are as follows: When a person has erected a new house or bought new things, whether he already possesses similar things or not, he says &#x201C;Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hast kept us in life and hast preserved us and enabled us to reach this season.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. The same blessing is said when one sees an associate after thirty days. If however twelve months have elapsed since he was last seen, one says &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who quickenest the dead.&#x201D; The first time in the season that one sees<xref rid="fn93">&#x002A;</xref> a fruit that is renewed every year, the blessing is said &#x201C;Who hast kept us in life, etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3. On hearing good news, one says, &#x201C;Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who art good, and doest good.&#x201D; On hearing evil tidings, one says, &#x201C;Blessed be the true judge.&#x201D; A person has to bless God with good will, for ill fortune, just as he has to bless Him with joy for good fortune, as it is said &#x201C;And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul and with all thy might.&#x201D; (Deuteronomy 6:5). In the abounding love of God enjoined upon us, it is implied that even in distress, one should thank and praise Him with joy.</p>
<p>4. When one has experienced good fortune or heard good news, even if the indications are that the good fortune will be followed by evil consequences, he says the blessing &#x201C;Who art good and doest good.&#x201D; So too, if one suffers a misfortune or has heard evil tidings, even if the circumstances indicate that the results will be advantageous, he says &#x201C;Blessed be the true Judge&#x201D;; since the blessings we say have reference not to future events, but to what has just happened.</p>
<p>5. When heavy rains fall, the owner of a field repeats the blessing &#x201C;Who hast preserved us in life.&#x201D; If one is part owner with others, he recites the blessing &#x201C;Who art good and doest good.&#x201D; One who does not own a field says &#x201C;We thank Thee, O Lord, our God, for every drop which Thou hast caused to fall for us. And even if our mouths were full of song as the sea,<xref rid="fn94">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> and our tongues of exultations as the multitude of its waves, and our lips of praise as the wide extended firmament; and though our eyes shone with light like the sun and the moon, and our hands were spread forth like the eagles of heaven, and our feet were swift as hinds, we should be unable to thank Thee, O Lord our God, and to bless Thy name, O our King, for one minute portion of the billions and trillions of bounties that Thou hast bestowed upon us and upon our fathers in former times. From Egypt Thou hast redeemed us, O Lord our God; from the house of bondage, Thou hast delivered us. During famine Thou hast fed us and didst sustain us in plenty; from the sword Thou didst save us, and from pestilence Thou didst cause us to escape, and from sore and lasting diseases Thou didst draw us forth, O our King. Up till now, Thy tender mercies have helped us, and Thy loving-kindnesses have not forsaken us. Therefore the limbs which Thou hast spread forth in us, and the spirit and soul which Thou hast breathed into our nostrils and the tongue which Thou hast placed in our mouths, 10, they shall thank and bless Thy name, O Lord our God, Blessed art Thou, O Lord, to Whom is due abounding thanksgiving, God ever to be praised.</p>
<p>6. When is the blessing for rain said? From the time when the water swells upon the ground and the continuing rain causes bubbles to form on the surface of the water, and these join together.</p>
<p>7. A person is told that his father died and he is heir. If he has brothers, he first says the blessing which concludes with the phrase &#x201C;Judge of Truth&#x201D;, and then the blessing, the formula of which is &#x201C;Who is good and doeth good.&#x201D; If he has no brothers, he says the blessing &#x201C;Who hast preserved us in life etc.&#x201D; In short, one who shares a benefit with others, says the blessing &#x201C;Who is good and doeth good.&#x201D; When he is the sole beneficiary, he recites the blessing &#x201C;Who hast preserved us in life.&#x201D;</p>
<p>8. Four categories of individuals are required to offer thanksgiving: A person who had been sick and has recovered, a prisoner who has been released from prison, voyagers when they have landed, and travellers in the desert when they reach settled territory. The thanksgiving is to be offered in the presence of ten persons, of whom two, at least, must be scholars; as it is said &#x201C;Let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people and praise Him in the seat of the elders&#x201D; (Ps. 107:32). How is this thanksgiving offered, and what is the form of the blessing? The individual (who has occasion for gratitude) rises in the assembly and says the following blessing: &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who vouchsafest benefits unto the undeserving, who hast also vouchsafed good unto me. All the hearers present say: &#x201C;He who hath vouchsafed good unto thee, may He vouchsafe good unto thee forever.&#x201D;</p>
<p>9. On seeing a place where miracles had been wrought for Israel, such as the Red Sea or the fords of the Jordan, which the Israelites crossed with Joshua, one says &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who wroughtest miracles for our fathers in this place.&#x201D; This blessing is also said in any place where miracles had been vouchsafed to a multitude. But where a miracle had been vouchsafed to an individual, he, his son, and his grandson,<xref rid="fn95">&#x002A;</xref> also say the blessing &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who wroughtest miracles for me in this place&#x201D; or &#x201C;Who wroughtest miracles for my fathers in this place.&#x201D; When viewing the lion&#x2019;s den (into which Daniel was cast) or the fiery furnace (into which Chananiah, Mishael and Azariah were thrust), the blessing is recited &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who wroughtest miracles for the righteous at this place.&#x201D; When seeing a place where idols are worshipped, the blessing is said, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe,<xref rid="fn96">&#x002A;</xref> who hast been long suffering with those who transgress Thy will.&#x201D; When seeing a place from which idolatry has been eradicated, if it is in the Holy Land, the blessing is said &#x201C;Who hast uprooted idolatry from our land&#x201D;; if it is outside Palestine, &#x201C;Who hast uprooted idolatry from this place.&#x201D; To both blessings, the petition is added &#x201C;Even as Thou hast uprooted idolatry from this place, so do Thou uproot it from all places and turn the heart of idol worshippers to serve Thee.</p>
<p>10. If one sees fine houses of Israelites (that are inhabited),<xref rid="fn97">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> he says, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe who settest up the border stone of the widow.&#x201D; If they are in ruins, he says, &#x201C;Blessed be the true judge.&#x201D; On seeing the graves of Israelites, one says, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, who formed you in judgment, and quickened you in judgment, sustained you in judgment and nourished you in judgment and will hereafter raise you up in judgment, to life in the world to come, Blessed art Thou O Lord, who quickenest the dead.&#x201D;</p>
<p>11. If one sees at one time six hundred thousand persons, who are heathens, he says &#x201C;Your mother shall be sore ashamed, she that bore you shall be confounded; behold, the latter end of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land and a desert.&#x201D; (Jerem. 50:12) Should they be Israelites, and he sees them in the land of Israel, he says, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, wise in secrets.&#x201D; When seeing a gentile sage, one says, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe Who hast imparted of Thy wisdom to flesh and blood.&#x201D; If the sage is an Israelite, he says &#x201C;Who hast imparted of Thy wisdom unto them that fear Thee.&#x201D; When seeing Israelite kings, one says &#x201C;Who hast given of Thy glory and might to them that fear Thee.&#x201D; If they are gentile kings, he says &#x201C;Who hast given of Thy glory to flesh and blood.&#x201D;</p>
<p>12. On seeing a negro, or anyone unusual in facial appearance or conformation of his limbs, one says, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who variest the forms of creatures.&#x201D; On seeing a blind person, a cripple, or one afflicted with boils or tetters, etc. the blessing said is &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, the true Judge.&#x201D; If the affliction is congenital, the blessing is &#x201C;Who variest the forms of creatures.&#x201D; On seeing an elephant, an ape or an owl one says, &#x201C;Blessed be He Who varieth the forms of creatures.&#x201D;</p>
<p>13. On seeing creatures that are beautiful or exceptionally well formed or goodly trees, one says &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe Who hast such as these in the world.&#x201D; If one goes out into the fields or gardens during Nisan (i.e. in the Spring) and sees the trees in bud and the flowers in bloom, he says, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast made Thy world lacking in nought, and hast produced therein goodly creatures and good and beautiful trees wherewith to delight the children of men&#x201D;.</p>
<p>14. For fierce gales, lightning, thunder, terrestrial rumblings that sound like the grinding of huge mills, or for an atmospheric light that has the appearance of shooting stars, swiftly moving from place to place, or of comets;&#x2014;<italic>the witness</italic> of any of these phenomena says the blessing. &#x201C;Blessed art Thou O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Whose strength and might fill the world&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Who hast made the Creation&#x201D;.</p>
<p>15. For mountains and hills, seas, deserts or rivers, if one sees any of these at intervals of thirty days, he says the blessing &#x201C;Who hast made the Creation.&#x201D; On seeing the Ocean at intervals of thirty days or more, one says &#x201C;Who hast made the Great Sea.&#x201D;</p>
<p>16. At sight of a rainbow, one says the blessing &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who rememberest the Covenant, art faithful to Thy Covenant and keepest Thy promise.&#x201D; At sight of the new moon, one says, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, by Whose word the heavens were created, and by the breath of Whose mouth all their hosts. A statute and season Thou didst assign unto them, that they should not change their appointed charge. They are glad and rejoice to do the will of their Master&#x2014;faithful workers whose work is faithful. And the moon He bade renew herself as a crown of glory unto those that have been upborne by Him from the womb, who, in the time to come, will themselves be renewed like her, to honor their Creator for His glorious sovereignty&#x2019;s sake and for all that He has created. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who renewest the months.&#x201D;</p>
<p>17. This blessing is said standing; For everyone who says the blessing for the new moon at the appointed time is regarded as if he had received the Divine Presence. If one has not said the blessing the first night, (of the new moon) he may do so up to the sixteenth of the month, when it is full moon.</p>
<p>18. When one sees the Sun at the vernal equinox, at the beginning of the twenty-eight years&#x2019; cycle, in the morning of the fourth day of the week, the exact time of the equinox being at the beginning of the evening of the fourth day of the week, he says the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou &#x2026; Who hast made the Creation.&#x201D; So also, when the moon enters the zodiacal constellation of <italic>Aries</italic> (the Ram) at the beginning of the month and does not deflect its course, neither to the north nor to the south; so too when any of the remaining five planets (Jupiter, Mars, Saturn, Venus, Mercury) enters the constellation of Aries (the Ram) at the beginning of the month and does not deflect its course either to the north or the south; or when one sees the constellation of the Ram rise from the extreme East of the horizon, he says &#x201C;Blessed art Thou &#x2026; Who hast made the Creation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>19. At the sight of houses of idolators in good condition,<xref rid="fn98">&#x002A;</xref> one says, &#x201C;The Lord will pluck up the house of the proud.&#x201D; (Prov. 15:25) If these are in ruins, he says, &#x201C;O God of Vengeance, Lord, O God of vengeance, shine forth&#x201D; (Ps. 94:1). On seeing graves of idolaters, one says, &#x201C;Your mother shall be ashamed etc.&#x201D; (Jerem. 50:12)</p>
<p>20. When about to enter a bath house, one says, &#x201C;May it be Thy will, O Lord, My God, to cause me to enter in peace and come forth in peace and deliver me from peril in the present and also in the future. Before the operation of blood letting, the patient says &#x201C;May it be Thy will, O Lord, my God, that this may conduce to my health, for Thou healest of Thy free grace.&#x201D; After the treatment is over, he says &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, who healest the sick.&#x201D;</p>
<p>21. When one proceeds to measure grain on his threshing-floor, he says &#x201C;May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to send a blessing on the work of my hands.&#x201D; After he has begun to measure, he says &#x201C;Blessed be He Who sendeth a blessing on this quantity of grain. If he first measures and then offers up a petition,&#x2014;this is a vain prayer; and generally supplication with reference to what is past is a vain prayer.</p>
<p>22. On entering the house of study, one says &#x201C;May it by Thy will, O Lord my God, that I may not err in a matter of <italic>Halacha</italic> (<italic>law</italic>), that I may not say of that which is clean that it is unclean, or of that which is unclean that it is clean; or of that which is permitted that it is forbidden, or of that which is forbidden that it is permitted; so that, not erring in a Halachie matter, my colleagues may rejoice with me; and that my colleagues may not err so that I may rejoice with them.&#x201D; On leaving the house of study, one says &#x201C;I render thanks unto Thee, O Lord my God for that Thou hast appointed my portion with those who abide in the house of study and hast not appointed my portion with those who tarry at the street corners; for I rise up early and they rise up early. I rise up early to study the words of the Torah, and they rise up early to engage in vain things, I labour and they labour. I labour in the words of the Torah and receive a reward. They labour and have no reward. I hasten and they hasten. I hasten to life in the world to come and they hasten to the pit of destruction.&#x201D;</p>
<p>23. On entering a city, one says, &#x201C;May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to cause me to enter this city in peace.&#x201D; Having entered it safely, he says, &#x201C;I thank Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast caused me to enter in peace.&#x201D; When about to leave, he says, &#x201C;May it be Thy will, O Lord my God, to cause me to go forth from this city in peace.&#x201D; Having left safely, he says, &#x201C;I thank Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast brought me forth in peace. And even as Thou hast brought me forth in peace, so lead me in peace, guide my steps in peace, sustain me in peace, and save me from the power of the enemy and from him that lurketh by the way.&#x201D;</p>
<p>24. To sum up: One should always offer supplications in regard to the future and ask for Divine mercies, and give thanks for the past, praising God and lauding Him according to one&#x2019;s abilities. The more one praises and lauds God, the more praiseworthy one is. And when he leaves the bath-house, he says: I give thanks to Thee, O Lord my God, that Thou hast saved me from the (excessive) heat.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER XI</h1>
<p>1. All blessings begin with the formula &#x201C;Blessed art Thou O Lord&#x201D; and conclude with the same formula; with the exception of the blessing said after the recital of the Shema, or a blessing immediately following a blessing connected with it, the blessing for fruits, and similar blessings as well as those said at the fulfillment of religious duties. Among these blessings, of which we have spoken, and which are in the nature of praise and thanksgiving, some begin with the formula &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, etc.&#x201D; but do not so conclude; while others conclude with this formula but do not begin with it. There are still a few blessings recited at the fulfilment of religious duties, such as the blessing said at the reading of the Law and that said on viewing the graves of Israelites, which are in the nature of praise and thanksgiving (and nevertheless open and close with the formula &#x201C;Blessed art Thou etc&#x201D;). All other blessings said at the fulfilment of religious duties, begin with the formula &#x201C;Blessed art Thou&#x201D; but do not so conclude.</p>
<p>2. There are some affirmative precepts in regard to which there is an obligation sedulously to strive to fulfil them; as, for example, to put on phylacteries, dwell in a booth on the feast of Tabernacles, take in the hand a palm branch together with the other plants on that feast, hear the sound of the ram&#x2019;s horn on the New Year. These are termed obligatory because there is an unconditional obligation to fulfill them. Again there are religious duties which are not obligatory but are in a sense permissive; for example, to affix a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> to the doors of a house or build a parapet on the roof; since there is no obligation to dwell in a house that requires a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> to be affixed to it. One may, if one chooses, live all one&#x2019;s lifetime in a tent or on a ship. Similarly there is no obligation to build a house in order to erect a parapet round the roof. Every duty to God, whether permissive or obligatory, requires a blessing to be said before its fulfilment.</p>
<p>3. So too, all religious duties ordained by the Scribes, whether these are according to their dicta, obligatory; (for example, to read the Scroll of Esther on the Feast of Lots, to kindle lights on the Eve of the Sabbath and during the feast of <italic>Chanucah</italic>); or whether these duties are optional,&#x2014;for example, to make an <italic>Erub</italic><xref rid="fn99">&#x002A;</xref> or to wash the hands<xref rid="fn100">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> all require, before they are performed, the recital of a blessing, containing the formula &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandment and commanded us (to perform that particular duty). Where in the Torah did God so command us? In the text (Deut. 17:11) &#x201C;&#x2026; and according to the judgment which they tell thee, thou shalt do.&#x201D; Hence, the meaning and purport of the Benedictory formula is as follows &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments among which Thou hast commanded us to give heed to those spiritual leaders who ordained that we should kindle the <italic>Chanucah</italic> light or read the Scroll of Esther.&#x201D; This applies to all the other duties ordained by the Scribes.</p>
<p>4. Why is no blessing said, when washing the hands at the close of a meal? Because this was only ordained as a precaution against danger to health,<xref rid="fn101">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> and acts that are of a precautionary character do not require the recital of a blessing. This is similar to the rule that, before drinking water at night, one strains it to avoid the risk of swallowing a leech. One does not, on such an occasion, recite a blessing &#x201C;And commanded us to strain water.&#x201D; The same principle applies to all similar cases.</p>
<p>5. If a person fulfilled a religious duty and omitted to say the appropriate blessing, he still says the blessing as long as the duty is in course of fulfilment. Once the fulfilment is past, he does not say the blessing. For example, when a man puts on a garment with <italic>Zizith</italic> (ritual fringes) or puts on phylacteries, or sits down in a booth on the Feast of Tabernacles, without reciting the appropriate blessing, he says, after having put on the garments with fringes, &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to enwrap ourselves in a garment with fringes.&#x201D; Similarly, after having put on phylacteries, he says the blessing &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to put on phylacteries;&#x201D; or after sitting down in the booth, he says &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to dwell in a booth.&#x201D; And so in all similar cases [where the fulfillment of the duty is continuing, the blessing may be recited during its continuance, if he has not done so at the beginning].</p>
<p>6. But if he ritually slew a beast or fowl without reciting the blessing, he should not, after the slaying, recite the blessing &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning ritual slaughter.&#x201D; So too, if he had already covered the blood (of a fowl or clean wild beast), or set apart the priest&#x2019;s dues or levite&#x2019;s tithes, or taken a ritual bath, without saying the appropriate blessing, he should not say it after the religious duty had been discharged. The principle applies to all similar cases.</p>
<p>7. There is one religious duty only where the blessing is said after the act to which it refers, namely the immersion of a proselyte (at his reception into Judaism). The reason is that, previously to the rite, he could not have said &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us,&#x201D; as he was neither sanctified nor commanded till he had taken the ritual bath. Hence he recites the blessing after the immersion, because, till that act had been performed, he was primarily ineligible and not qualified to say the blessing.</p>
<p>8. Whenever the performance of a religious duty definitely completes the obligation, the blessing is recited at the time it is performed. Whenever the fulfillment of a precept is an antecedent to another precept, the blessing is said at the fulfillment of the latter. For example. A person builds a booth for the Feast of Tabernacles, prepares the palm branch for that festival, fashions a ram&#x2019;s horn for the New Year, puts fringes on a garment, or prepares phylacteries or a <italic>Mezuzah</italic>.<xref rid="fn102">&#x002A;</xref> He does not, when preparing any of these articles of religious use, say the blessing &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to build a booth, prepare the palm branch, write phylacteries&#x201D;; because the act in each of these cases is followed by another precept. When is the blessing said? When one sits in the booth (on the feast of Tabernacles), handles the palm branch, listens to the sound of the ram&#x2019;s horn (on the New Year) enwraps himself in the fringed garment, puts on phylacteries, affixes the <italic>Mezuzah.</italic> If however one erects a parapet on the roof, he recites, at the time of erection, the blessing &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning a parapet&#x201D;; and so with similar precepts.</p>
<p>9. A precept which is fulfilled at definite periods, for example, listening to the sound of the ram&#x2019;s horn, sitting in the tabernacle, handling the palm branch, reading the Scroll of Esther, lighting the Chanucah light; likewise every precept, connected with private property, e.g. putting on a fringed garment or putting on phylacteries for the first time, fixing the <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> erection of a parapet on the roof; as also a precept, not of a continuous character, and for which the opportunity of fulfillment does not always occur, e.g. circumcision of a male infant, redemption of the first born,&#x2014;each of these requires the blessing &#x201C;Who hast preserved us in life, etc.&#x201D; to be said at the time of performance. If one omitted to say this blessing when building the tabernacle, or preparing the palm branch, he says it, when he fulfills his obligation connected therewith. This principle obtains in all similar cases.</p>
<p>10. Whether one fulfills a religious duty for oneself or on behalf of others, he always, before doing it, says the blessing &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to do, etc.&#x201D; The blessing &#x201C;Who hast preserved us in life, etc.&#x201D; is only said when a precept is fulfilled on one&#x2019;s own behalf. If a person has several duties to perform, he does not say &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us concerning the precepts&#x201D;, but, at the performance of each precept, he says the blessing appropriate to it.</p>
<p>11. When fulfilling a religious duty&#x2014;whether it be a personal obligation or not, if one does it for himself, he says, &#x201C;&#x2026; and commanded us to do (the particular duty)&#x201D;. If he does it on behalf of others, he says &#x201C;&#x2026; and commanded us concerning the duty.&#x201D;</p>
<p>12. For example, on putting on phylacteries, one says the blessing concluding &#x201C;&#x2026; and commanded us to lay <italic>Tephillin</italic> (phylacteries)&#x201D;. When putting on the <italic>Tallith</italic> (fringed garment), he says the blessing ending &#x201C;&#x2026; to enwrap oneself in the fringed garment.&#x201D; On taking a seat in the tabernacle (on the feast of Tabernacles), the blessing to be said ends &#x201C;to dwell in the tabernacle&#x201D;. And so other blessings end &#x201C;to kindle the light for the Sabbath&#x201D;; to read the <italic>Hallel</italic><xref rid="fn103">&#x002A;</xref> (Psalms 113-118) recited on Festivals and on the Feast of Dedication. So too, if a person affixes the <italic>Mezuzah,</italic> to rooms in his own home, he ends the blessing&#x2014;&#x201C;to affix the <italic>Mezuzah</italic>.&#x201D; If he builds a parapet for his own roof, he says the blessing &#x201C;Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to make a parapet.&#x201D; If a person sets aside the priest&#x2019;s dues from his own produce, he says a blessing ending &#x201C;to set aside the dues&#x201D;. If he circumcises his son, the blessing he says ends &#x201C;to circumcise the son&#x201D;. If he slays his own paschal lamb or brings his festival offering, he says the blessing ending &#x201C;to slay, etc.&#x201D;</p>
<p>13. But if he affixes a <italic>Mezuzah</italic> to the door of another&#x2019;s home, the blessing he says ends &#x201C;Concerning the affixing of a Mezuzah&#x201D;. If he makes a parapet to the roof of a house belonging to others, he says a blessing concluding &#x201C;concerning the making of a parapet.&#x201D; If he separates priests&#x2019; dues for other owners&#x2019; produce, he says a blessing ending &#x201C;concerning the setting apart of dues.&#x201D; If he circumcises another person&#x2019;s male infant, he says the blessing ending &#x201C;concerning the circumcision.&#x201D; The same principle applies to all similar cases.</p>
<p>14. When a person fulfills a precept for himself and others jointly, and the precept is not of an obligatory character, he says a blessing which ends &#x201C;concerning the fulfillment of the precept.&#x201D; Thus the blessing said, when making an <italic>Erub,</italic> ends &#x201C;concerning the precept of the <italic>Erub</italic>.&#x201D; If the precept is obligatory and the intent was to discharge the obligation for himself and others, the blessing concludes &#x201C;to fulfill the precept.&#x201D; Thus the blessing said at the sounding of the ram&#x2019;s horn (on the New Year) ends &#x201C;to hear the sound of the ram&#x2019;s horn.&#x201D;</p>
<p>15. When a person takes the palm branch (on the feast of Tabernacles), he says the blessing ending &#x201C;concerning the taking of the palm-branch;&#x201D; because, as soon as he has taken it, he has discharged his obligation. If however one says the blessing before taking the palm branch, the blessing ends &#x201C;to take the palm-branch,&#x201D; on the analogy of the formula &#x201C;to dwell in the tabernacle.&#x201D; Hence the general rule that when the blessing is said after the precept has been performed, the blessing ends with the formula &#x201C;concerning the precept.&#x201D; But when one washes the hands or slaughters cattle for food, even for one&#x2019;s own consumption,&#x2014;since these are optional, the blessings end with the respective formulas &#x201C;concerning the slaughtering of cattle;&#x201D; &#x201C;concerning covering the blood (of birds or deer);&#x201D; &#x201C;concerning washing of the hands.&#x201D; So also the blessing said &#x201C;when searching for leaven on the evening after the 13th of Nisan&#x201D; ends &#x201C;concerning the destruction of leaven&#x201D;&#x2014;whether the search is on one&#x2019;s own behalf or for others; because, as soon as he has resolved in his mind to annul the leaven, the duty of destroying it has been discharged, before he begins the search,&#x2014;as will be expounded in the proper place.</p>
<p>16. For a practice that is only customary, even if traced to the prophets, for example, taking the willow branch on the seventh day of the feast of Tabernacles, and&#x2014;needless to add&#x2014;if it is ascribed to the Sages, for example, reciting the <italic>Hallel</italic><xref rid="fn104">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> on new moons and the intermediate days of Passover, no blessing is to be recited at its performance.<xref rid="fn105">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> Thus also any act, in regard to which you are in doubt whether it requires a blessing or not, should be performed without a blessing. One should always carefully avoid saying blessings unnecessarily; and should be heedful to recite, as often as there may be occasion, the blessings that are requisite. And so David said &#x201C;Every day I will bless Thee and praise Thy name forever&#x201D; (Ps. 145:2).</p>
<p>Blessed be the all merciful who hath aided us.</p>

<chapter>
<title>LAWS OF CIRCUMCISION</title>
<p align="blockquote">A single affirmative precept, namely, to circumcise male infants on the eighth day after birth. The exposition of this precept follows in these chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>1. Circumcision is an affirmative precept, the neglect of which entails the penalty of excision, as it is said, &#x201C;And the uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin&#x2014;that soul shall be cut off from his people&#x201D; (Gen. 17:14). It is a duty incumbent upon the father to circumcise his son, and upon the master to circumcise his male slave, whether &#x201C;born in the house&#x201D; or bought with money. If the father or master failed to perform the circumcision, he has neglected the fulfillment of an affirmative precept but has not incurred the penalty of excision, to which only the uncircumcised person is made liable. In such case of neglect, the court is charged with the duty of circumcising the infant or slave at the appointed time, and must not leave any male uncircumcised among the Israelites or their slaves.</p>
<p>2. A male infant is not circumcised without the father&#x2019;s knowledge, unless the latter has neglected his duty and refrained from circumcising it. In this case, the Court has it circumcised even against the father&#x2019;s will. Should the child have escaped the notice of the Court, so that it did not have the child circumcised, then that person is under an obligation, when he grows up, to have himself circumcised. Every day that passes, after he is grown up, that he remains uncircumcised, he is neglecting the fulfillment of an affirmative precept. He does not however incur the penalty of excision till he has died, having wilfully remained uncircumcised.</p>
<p>3. The master is under an obligation to circumcise his male slaves, whether at birth they were his property or whether they had been acquired from a non-Israelite. There is a distinction however between these cases. A slave born in an Israelite&#x2019;s home is circumcised on the eighth day after birth; the slave bought with money, on the day that he is bought. Even if he was born on the day he was bought, he is circumcised on the same day.</p>
<p>4. Under certain circumstances, a slave acquired by purchase is circumcised on the eighth day after birth, while one born in the house is circumcised on the day he is born. For example, a female slave is bought, and her still unborn child is bought at the same time, the child, subsequently born, is circumcised when eight days old. For, although it had been separately bought, and is thus a slave acquired by purchase, still, as the mother had been acquired before the infant&#x2019;s birth, it is circumcised on the eighth day.</p>
<p>5. On the other hand, when a female slave was acquired for the sake of her offspring only (i.e. that her offspring might belong to the purchaser); or when she was acquired with the stipulation that she was not to take the ritual bath so as to have the status of a slave in an Israelite&#x2019;s home, though her subsequently born child is born as the property of the Israelite, it is circumcised on the day it is born; because this infant is as though it had been bought alone and had been bought on the day of its birth,&#x2014;as the mother had not come within the category of an Israelite&#x2019;s female slave, so as to make her male child a slave &#x201C;born in the house&#x201D;. Should she however, after delivery, have taken the ritual bath, the infant is circumcised on the eighth day.</p>
<p>6. If one acquired from an idolater, an adult slave who is unwilling to be circumcised, efforts are to be made for a period of twelve months to persuade him to submit to the rite. Should he at the end of this period still remain uncircumcised, he may not be retained but must be resold to a non-Israelite. But if, while he had still been with his non-Israelite master, the condition of sale had been made that he was not to be circumcised, he may be retained (by his new Jewish owner), though uncircumcised&#x2014;provided that he undertakes to keep the seven Noachide precepts and he will then have the status of a proselyte of the gate. If he does not accept these seven precepts he is to be put to death (as a lawless individual). Proselytes of the gate are only received while the institution of the Jubilee is in force.</p>
<p>7. A proselyte must, before he can enter the communion of Israel be circumcised. If, while still a gentile, he had already been circumcised, it is requisite to draw a drop of blood from the <italic>membrum,</italic> on the day when he is received, as a sign of the covenant. Similarly, if a male infant is born with the prepuce absent, it is requisite to draw a drop of blood from the <italic>membrum</italic> when the infant is eight days old. An <italic>androgyne</italic> that has both male and female organs is to be circumcised on the eighth day. So too a male infant delivered by the Caesarean operation, or one born with two foreskins is to be circumcised on the eighth day.</p>
<p>8. Circumcisions are only performed during the daytime after sunrise, whether the operation takes place on the eighth day, the regular time, or subsequently, from the ninth day and further on, as it is said &#x201C;on the eighth <italic>day</italic>&#x201D; (Gen. 17:12) i.e. by day, and not at night. If the circumcision takes place after daybreak, it is correct. The whole of the day is proper for circumcision. Still it is a duty to perform it in the early part of the day, for the zealous fulfill their religious obligations at the earliest possible time.</p>
<p>9. When a circumcision takes place at the regular time (on the eighth day), it supersedes the prohibition of work on the Sabbath. But if it is to be performed after the regular time, it neither overrides the obligation of the Sabbath nor of the festivals. Whether performed at the regular time or not, it supersedes the obligation of the law of leprosy. If there was a bright leprous spot on the foreskin, the spot is cut off with the foreskin. For though the hacking of a leprous plague spot is prohibited, the affirmative precept (of circumcision) overrides the prohibition.</p>
<p>10. Even as the circumcision of male infants overrides the obligation of the Sabbath, so the circumcision of bondmen who are to be circumcised on the eighth day, overrides the obligation of abstinence from work on the Sabbath, should the eighth day fall on the Sabbath. To this rule there is an exception, namely, that of a bondman &#x201C;born in the house&#x201D;, whose mother had not taken the ritual bath before the child was born. In this case, though the infant should be circumcised on the eighth day, the circumcision does not override the obligation of abstaining from work on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>11. When an infant was born &#x201C;circumcised&#x201D; (i.e. without a prepuce), or was delivered in the eighth month, after conception, while still immature&#x2014;when it is considered to be in the category of a still-born child, as it may not live&#x2014;; or if it was delivered by the Caesarean operation; or was an androgyne; or had two foreskins&#x2014;in any of these cases the duty of circumcision on the eighth day does not override the obligation of the Sabbath. All such infants are circumcised on the first day of the week, which is the ninth day after birth.</p>
<p>12. If an infant is born (in the evening) when it is dusk and doubtful whether it is still day or already night, the eight days are counted from the night and the infant is circumcised on the nominally ninth day, which may in fact be the eighth day after its birth. If an infant is born on the eve of the Sabbath at dusk, the circumcision does not override the obligation of the Sabbath. It is circumcised on the first day of the week, since in a case when it is doubtful whether the Sabbath is the eighth day, the obligation of the Sabbath is not superseded.</p>
<p>13. If an eighth-month infant shows full development in its hair and nails, it is (regarded as) a mature seventh-month infant the delivery of which has been delayed. It may therefore (as a living being) be carried and taken from place to place on the Sabbath, and is not regarded as a stone (an inanimate object). It is circumcised on the Sabbath (should that be the eighth day after its birth). But if it was born with its hair undeveloped and its nails not perfectly formed as these are in normal infants, it is regarded as an eighth-month child that would not have been maturely developed till its ninth month, but that had been prematurely delivered while still immature. It is regarded as a stone (an inanimate object) and may not be moved on the Sabbath. Should it however live for thirty days, it is considered an infant capable of continued existence, and as in all respects like other infants; for an infant of the human species that survives for thirty days is no longer in the same category with the still-born.</p>
<p>14. A seventh-month infant that is fully formed is regarded as an infant expected to live, and is circumcised on the Sabbath. If it is doubtful whether such an infant is a seventh or an eighth-month child, it is, on either assumption, circumcised on the Sabbath. If it is, in fact, a seventh-month infant and mature, it is in accordance with the law that the circumcision should override the obligation of abstinence from work on the Sabbath. If it is an eighth-month child, the operator who circumcises it is regarded as cutting flesh, since an eighth-month infant is in the same category with a still-born child.</p>
<p>15. If the head of the foetus had emerged at dusk on the eve of the Sabbath, though complete delivery had not taken place till after night-fall of the Sabbath, the infant is not circumcised on a Sabbath. And in every case whenever a circumcision does not supersede the obligation to rest on the Sabbath, it likewise does not supersede the obligation to refrain from work on the first days of the festivals; but does supersede this obligation on the second days of the festivals. To this rule the New Year forms an exception. Circumcision (in cases where it would not supersede the obligation to rest on the Sabbath) does not supersede the duty to refrain from work on the first or on the second day of the New Year.<xref rid="fn106">&#x002A;</xref> So also, a circumcision, not taking place at the due time (on the eighth day after birth), does not supersede the obligation to refrain from work on the two days of the New Year.</p>
<p>16. A sick infant is not circumcised till it is well. Seven consecutive periods, each of twenty four hours, are counted from its recovery, after which it is circumcised. This applies to recovery from fever and similar illnesses. But if it had suffered from sore eyes, then as soon as the eyes are open and well, it is immediately circumcised. And so with similar disorders [that are localized and do not affect the general health].</p>
<p>17. An infant found on the eighth day to be excessively yellow is not circumcised till the circulation has become normal, and its complexion is like that of other healthy infants. So too, if it was excessively ruddy, presenting the appearance of one who had been dyed red, it is not circumcised till the blood has been absorbed, and its complexion is like that of other infants&#x2014;this redness being a disease. In these cases, great caution must be exercised.</p>
<p>18. When a woman&#x2019;s first male child was circumcised and died as a result of the operation, which lowered its vitality, and her second male child also died as a result of its circumcision,&#x2014;whether that infant was by the same or by another husband,&#x2014;her third male child must not be circumcised at the appointed period (on the eighth day). The operation must be deferred till the infant has grown and its constitutional vigour is established. No child may be circumcised, unless it is entirely free from disease, since danger to life is a factor that overrides everything else. It is possible to circumcise after the appointed time, but it is impossible to restore a life that is extinct.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. All are qualified to perform the operation of circumcision. Where there is no adult circumcised male, (Israelite), it is performed by an uncircumcised Israelite, a bondman, a woman or a minor. But under no circumstances does a gentile circumcise. If however he has done so, the operation need not be repeated.<xref rid="fn107">&#x002A;</xref> The circumcision may be performed with any instrument made of flint, glass or other material which cuts. One should not however use a reed for fear that splinters may hurt the child. The best method of fulfilling the precept is to use an iron instrument, such as a knife or shears. The universal custom in Israel is to use a knife.</p>
<p>2. How is circumcision performed? The entire foreskin which covers the glans is cut, so that the whole of the glans is exposed. Then the thin layer of skin (mucous membrane) beneath the foreskin in divided with the nail and turned back, till the flesh of the glans is completely exposed. The wound is then sucked till the blood has been drawn from parts remote (from the surface), thus obviating danger (to the child&#x2019;s health). The operator who omits to do so is removed from practice. After this has been done, a plaster, bandage, or similar dressing is applied.</p>
<p>3. There are some cases where shreds of skin that are left render the circumcision invalid. In others, they do not render it invalid. If so much of the foreskin remains as to cover the greater part of the glans, lengthwise, the infant is regarded as uncircumcised, as it was before the operation. This is a case of a shred of skin that invalidates the circumcision. If only a small portion of skin is left that does not cover the greater part of the length of the glans,&#x2014;it is a filament, the non-removal of which does not invalidate the circumcision.</p>
<p>4. The operator, as long as he is still occupied with the circumcision, resumes his task to remove both kinds of shreds. But if he has completed the circumcision, he only resumes his task to remove these filaments, the non-removal of which would invalidate the circumcision, but not those which do not make it invalid. Should he have performed the circumcision and not drawn back the inner skin, (mucous membrane) it is as if he had not circumcised at all.</p>
<p>5. An infant whose flesh is tender and flaccid or who is fat, so that it appears as if it had not been circumcised, is to be examined during an erection. If it then seems circumcised, nothing need be done. Still the (flaccid) flesh should, for the sake of appearances, be pushed back on both sides. But if during erection, it does not appear circumcised, the flaccid flesh is cut away on both sides, so that the glans appears thoroughly exposed during erection. This is an ordinance of the scribes. But according to the Scriptual law, even if the infant appears uncircumcised, once the circumcision has taken place, it need not be repeated.</p>
<p>6. All the requisites that belong to the act of circumcision are done on the Sabbath. The foreskin is removed, the mucous <italic>lamella</italic> (inner layer of skin) retracted, the blood drawn by suction. If shreds of skin are left, such as would make the circumcision invalid, the operator resumes his task to remove them, even after he has completed the circumcision. If the shreds are such as would not invalidate the circumcision, he only does so if he is still engaged in the operation. A dressing is applied. But the <italic>preliminary</italic> preparations for the circumcision do not override the obligation of the Sabbath. For example, if a knife was not found, it may not be manufactured on the Sabbath. Nor may it be carried from place to place. And if no <italic>Erub</italic><xref rid="fn108">&#x002A;</xref> had been prepared to permit carrying through an alley communicating between two courts, the knife may not even be carried from one court to the other. For though the <italic>Erub</italic> is a Rabbinic ordinance, the necessity of bringing the knife does not override the requirement of compliance with the Erub; since the knife could have been brought on the day before the Sabbath.</p>
<p>7. So too, drugs for the dressing are not ground on the Sabbath; water is not heated, neither is a dressing prepared nor an emulsion of wine and oil mixed. If cummin seed (used as a styptic) had not been ground on the day before the Sabbath, the operator chews it with his teeth and applies it. If an emulsion of wine and oil had not been prepared, he applies each separately. The general principle is as follows: Whatever might have been prepared on the day before the Sabbath does not supersede the obligation of the Sabbath. If the requisites had been forgotten and not been provided, the circumcision is put off to the ninth day.</p>
<p>8. If, after the circumcision, the warm water for bathing the infant had been spilt, or the drugs (for the dressing) had been scattered, everything needed is prepared on the Sabbath day so as to avoid danger to the child. Where it is the practice to bathe the infant, this is done on the Sabbath when the circumcision takes place, before or after the operation, and also on the third day after the operation, should that day fall on the Sabbath. The bathing takes place, of the whole body or of the genitals only, according to the local custom, with water which had been kept warm from the previous day, or which had to be heated on the Sabbath, since the omission of the ablution might be dangerous to the infant.</p>
<p>9. If, through forgetfulness, the knife had not been brought on the day before the Sabbath, a non-Israelite is directed to bring it,&#x2014;provided that he does not carry it through the public thoroughfare. The general principle may be stated as follows: Whatever we are forbidden to do by Rabbinic ordinance, as a precaution to prevent Sabbath violation, we may direct a gentile to do, to enable us to fulfill a religious precept at the proper time. But whatever is forbidden to be done by us on the Sabbath because it is work, we may not ask a gentile to do on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>10. The requisite preliminaries in preparation for the circumcision&#x2014;even when it is to take place on the proper day, do not supersede the obligation of abstaining from work on the festival, since these could have been prepared on the day before the festival. This can be deduced <italic>a fortiori.</italic> Since the preparation of preliminaries to circumcision do not supersede a prohibition which is a precaution to prevent Sabbath violation, and which is only a Rabbinic ordinance, how can it supersede a prohibition of work on the festivals which is expressly forbidden in the Scriptures. Drugs, however, that are required for the circumcision are ground on the festival, since they can be used for cooking (as spices).<xref rid="fn109">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> So too, wine and oil may be beaten up as an emulsion (to be used after the operation).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. Before circumcising, the operator recites the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and given us command concerning circumcision.&#x201D; This blessing is said by him when he circumcises the son of another person. If he was circumcising his own son, the formula he recites is &#x2026; &#x201C;and commanded us to circumcise the son.&#x201D; In either case, the father of the child recites another blessing also: &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments, and commanded us to make him enter into the covenant of Abraham, our ancestor.&#x201D; The duty is incumbent upon the father to have his son circumcised; and this is in addition to the obligation that rests on all Israelites to circumcise any male person among them. Hence, if the father is not present at the circumcision, the second blessing is not recited after it. One authority decided that in such a case, the Ecclesiastical court or one of those present should say this blessing. It is, however, not right to do so.</p>
<p>2. If there are persons present, they say (to the father) &#x201C;Even as thou hast brought him into the covenant, so mayest thou lead him to the study of the Torah, to marriage and to the performance of good deeds. The father, operator or any one else present says, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, Who, from the womb didst sanctify the well-beloved (Isaac), and didst set Thy statute in his flesh, and seal his offspring with the sign of the holy covenant. On this account, O living God, our Portion and our Rock, give command to deliver from destruction the dearly beloved of our flesh for the sake of the covenant which Thou hast set in our flesh. Blessed art Thou, O Lord, Who makest the covenant.&#x201D; The father of the child recites the blessing &#x201C;Who hast preserved us in life.&#x201D;<xref rid="fn110">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>3. One who circumcises proselytes says the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to circumcise proselytes and draw from them the blood of the covenant. For if it were not for the blood of the covenant, Heaven and Earth would not have endured, even as it is said &#x201C;Were it not for My Covenant by day and night, I would not have appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth&#x201D; (Jerem. 33-25).</p>
<p>4. If one circumcises his own bondman, he says the blessing, &#x201C;Blessed art Thou, O Lord our God, King of the Universe, Who hast sanctified us with Thy commandments and commanded us to circumcise bondmen and draw from them blood of the covenant; for if it were not for the blood of the covenant, Heaven and Earth would not exist. If one circumcises a bondman belonging to other persons, the formula recited is &#x2026; &#x201C;concerning the circumcision of bondmen.&#x201D; When an adult is circumcised, the private parts must be covered till after the blessing has been said; and then uncovered while the circumcision is performed.</p>
<p>5. If a proselyte had been circumcised before he became a proselyte, or if a male infant was born apparently circumcised, (i.e. with the prepuce deficient) no blessing is recited when a drop of blood is drawn from the virile member. So too, no blessing is said at the circumcision of an androgyne (<italic>hermaphrodite</italic>), since the subject is not positively (and exclusively) a male.</p>
<p>6. When a heathen needs to be circumcised because a wound of boil had formed in that part, an Israelite was (in ancient times) forbidden to perform the operation, on the principle that nothing is to be done to rescue idolaters from death or occasion it in their case. And this was the rule despite the possibility that this cure might be a religious act<xref rid="fn111">&#x002A;</xref> since no such intent had been expressed. Hence, if the idolater had the intent, expressed or otherwise known, that the operation should be a ritual circumcision (of a proselyte), an Israelite may perform the operation.</p>
<p>7. The foreskin is regarded as an abomination, for which the gentiles are contemned in Scripture, as it is said &#x201C;For all the nations are uncircumcised (Jer. 9-25). An important institution is Circumcision. For the Patriarch Abraham was not called perfect till he had circumcised himself, as it is said, &#x201C;Walk thou before me; and be thou perfect. And I will make my covenant between Me and thee&#x201D; (Gen. 17:1-2). Whoever neglects the covenant of our ancestor Abraham, and retains the foreskin or artificially obliterates the marks of circumcision, even if he has acquired much knowledge of the Torah and practises good deeds, will have no portion in the world to come.</p>
<p>8. Mark how strictly the observance of Circumcision is to be regarded. Moses, although he was on a journey did not receive indulgence a single hour for neglecting this duty. In connection with all the precepts of the Torah, three covenants were made with Israel; as it is said &#x201C;These are the words of the covenant which the Lord commanded &#x2026; beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb&#x201D; (Deut. 28:69). And in the next section it is said &#x201C;Ye are standing this day all of you before the Lord your God &#x2026; that thou shouldst enter into the covenant of the Lord thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 29:9-11). Three covenants are here mentioned. But in connection with Circumcision, thirteen covenants were made with our ancestor Abraham: &#x201C;And I will make My covenant between Me and thee&#x201D; (Gen. 17:2); &#x201C;As for me. behold, My covenant is with thee&#x201D; (ib. 17:4); &#x201C;And I will establish My covenant between Me and thee&#x201D; (ib. 17:7); &#x201C;for an everlasting covenant&#x201D; (ib. 17:7); &#x201C;And as for thee, thou shalt keep My covenant&#x201D; (ib. 17:9); &#x201C;This is My covenant which you shall keep&#x201D; (ib. 17:10) &#x201C;And it shall be a token of a covenant&#x201D; (ib. 17:11); &#x201C;And My covenant shall be in your flesh&#x201D; (ib. 17:13); &#x201C;for an everlasting covenant&#x201D; (ib. 17:13); &#x201C;he hath broken my covenant&#x201D; (ib. 17:14); &#x201C;And I will establish My covenant with him&#x201D; (ib. 17:19); &#x201C;for an everlasting covenant&#x201D; (ib. 17:19); &#x201C;But My covenant I will establish with Isaac&#x201D; (ib. 17:21).</p>
