"Glazer_Vol1, OVERVIEW OF MISHNEH TORAH CONTENTS.3","These are the six hundred and thirteen commandments which were transmitted orally to Moses on Sinai; they and their general, and their particular, and their precise exposition. All those general, particular and precise expositions of each and every commandment constitute the Oral Torah, which was received orally by one tribunal from another tribunal. There are, however, still other precepts, enacted after Revelation, and sustained by prophets and scholars, which spread throughout all Israel, for instance, such, as reading the book of Esther, Hanukah lights, fasting on the Ninth of Ab, carrying things and walking on the Sabbath (Erubin), and washing of the hands before meals, each and every one of these precepts having divers interpretations and suggestions, all of which will be elucidated in this compilation."
"Glazer_Vol1, OVERVIEW OF MISHNEH TORAH CONTENTS.4","All of these newly-proclaimed precepts we are obliged to accept and observe, even as it is said. ""Thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, not to the left"" (Deut. 17.11.), and they are not additions to the commandments of the Torah. If so, wherefore did the Torah charge us saying: ""Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it"" (Deut. 13.1.)? That refers to a prophet not to permit him to invent something and claim that the Holy One, blessed is He! ordered him to add a commandment to the commandments of the Torah, or to diminish one from these six hundred and thirteen commandments. But if a tribunal together with a prophet who flourished in a given period added a commandment in the form of a statute, or judicial decision, or edict, such is not an addition to the Torah. For, behold, they have not said that the Holy One, blessed is He! commanded to make an Erub, or read the Megilah on time; indeed, had they said so, they would have been adding to the commandments of the Torah; but what we do say is, The prophets together with the tribunal enacted it and commanded to read the Megilah on time, so as to remember the praiseworthiness of the Holy One, blessed is he! and the salvation which He brought about upon us by His nearness to us at the time of our supplication, so as to bless Him, and give thanks unto Him, and to proclaim to future generations the truth of what He assured us in the Torah, saying: ""For what great nation is there that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord our God is whensoever we call upon Him"" (Deut. 4.7.). In this way every precept, instituted by the words of the Sophrim, whether mandatory or prohibitive, came to pass."
"Glazer_Vol1, OVERVIEW OF MISHNEH TORAH CONTENTS.5","And, I have looked into the matter and divided this compilation in fourteen books, as follows:"

"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.2","""Then should I not be ashamed, when I have regard unto all Thy Commandments"". (Ps. 119.6.)"
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.3","All of the commandments which were given to Moses on Sinai were given together with their oral explanation for, it is said: ""And I will give thee the tables of stone, and the Torah and the commandment"" (Ex. 24.12.); the Torah, is Holy Writ; and the commandment, its oral explanation."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.4","Moreover, He commanded us to observe the Torah by the word of the commandment; thus it is this commandment which is called Oral Torah."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.5","The whole Torah was written by Moses our Master, before his demise, by his own hand; and he gave a Book to each and every tribe, and one Book he deposited in the Ark as testimony, even as it is said; ""Take this Book of the Torah and put it by the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there as a witness against thee"" (Deut. 32.26.); but the commandment, which is the oral explanation of the Torah, he did not reduce to writing, but he charged the Elders and Joshua and the rest of all Israel concerning its observance, even as it is said: ""All the word which I command you, that shall ye observe to do"" (Ibid. 23.1.); therefore, is this word of the commandment called, Oral Torah."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.6","Although the Oral Torah was not reduced to writing, Moses our Master gave instructions in its full scope at his tribunal-seat, to seventy Elders. Eleazar, Phinehas and Joshua, all the three of them received it from Moses; yet, unto Joshua, because he was the disciple of Moses our Master, he transmitted the Oral Torah and charged him concerning its observance. Joshua likewise continued throughout his lifetime to study it orally; and many Elders received it from Joshua. Eli received it from the Elders and from Phinehas; Samuel received it from Eli and his tribunal; David received it from Samuel and his tribunal; Ahijah the Shiloite who was among those who went forth out of Egypt, and a Levite, heard Moses expounding it; but, as he was an infant in the days of Moses, he became the recipient from David and his tribunal; Elijah received it from Ahijah the Shiloite and his tribunal; Elisha received it from Elijah and his tribunal; Jehoiadah the priest received it from Elisha and his tribunal; Zechariah received it from Jehoiadah and his tribunal; Hosea received it from Zechariah and his tribunal; Amos received it from Hosea and his tribunal; Isaiah received it from Amos and his tribunal; Micha received it from Isaiah and his tribunal; Joel received it from Micha and his tribunal; Nahum received it from Joel and his tribunal; Habakkuk received it from Nahum and his tribunal; Zephaniah received it from Habakkuk and his tribunal; Jeremiah received it from Zephaniah and his tribunal; Baruch son of Neriah received it from Jeremiah and his tribunal; Ezra and his tribunal received it from Baruch son of Neriah and his tribunal.

See Megilah, 16b. G.</i>, Zerubbable and many other scholars with them, totaling the number of an hundred and twenty Elders. The last surviving Elder of among them was Simeon the Just, who was included among the one hundred and twenty, and received the Oral Torah from all of them, and succeeded Ezra to the High Priesthood. Antigonus of Soko and his tribunal, received it from Simeon the Just and his tribunal; Jose son of Joezer of Zereda and Joseph son of Johanan of Jerusalem and their tribunal, received it from Antigonus and his tribunal; Joshua son of Perahya and Nittai of Arebela and their tribunal, received it from Jose son of Joezer and Joseph son of Johanan and their tribunal; Judah son of Tabbai and Simeon son of Shetah and their tribunal, received it from Joshua son of Perahyah and Nittai of Arebela and their tribunal; Shemaiah and Abtalion the Just Proselytes and their tribunal, received it from Judah and Simeon and their tribunal; Hillel and Shammai and their tribunal, received it from Shemaiah and Abtalion and their tribunal; Rabbin Johanan son of Zakkai and Simeon son of Hillel the Elder<sup>3</sup><i class=""footnote"">Simeon I.</i>, received it from Hillel and (Shammai) and their (his) tribunal(s).

"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.7","Our Holy Master compiled the Mishna. From the days of Moses our Master till our Holy Master no text book of the Oral Torah for public instruction had been issued, the practice theretofore being for the president of a tribunal or a prophet who flourished in a given generation to keep privately written memoranda of his Masters' oral teachings, out of which he, in turn, instructed the public orally. Like practice was resorted to by each and every individual scholar to write down, according to his ability of understanding the exposition on the Torah and its laws, as he heard it. So was also the practice in preserving new acts in each and every generation which were not based on tradition but upon one of the thirteen hermeneutical rules, to which the Great Tribunal had assented."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.8","This procedure was followed continuously until the advent of our Holy Master, and he collected all traditional precedents, judicial pronouncements, expositions and explanations, whether they were traditionally attributed to Moses our Master or whether they were so instructed by the tribunals in each and every generation, the scope of which embraced the whole Torah, and from it all he compiled the Book of the Mishna, out of which he gave public instruction to scholars, and its fame reached to all Israel, and written copies of it were made universally, and its circulation reached everywhere, so that the Oral Torah be not forgotten from the midst of Israel."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.9","But why did our Holy Master thus, and did not leave the matter as it was heretofore? Because he observed that the number of students continued to decrease, whereas the volume of oppression continued to increase with renewed strength; that the Roman Empire continued to spread out its boundaries in the world and conquer, whereas Israel continued to drift aimlessly and follow extremes, he, therefore, compiled one book, a handy volume for all, so that they may study it even in haste and not forget it. And his whole lifetime, he sat together with the members of his tribunal and gave public instruction in the Mishna. And these are the great scholars who were members of our Holy Master's tribunal, and who received it from him; Simon and Gamaliel his sons, Rabbi Aphos<sup>14</sup><i class=""footnote"">Successor to the Presidency of our Holy Master's tribunal.</i>, Rabbi Hanina son of Hama, Rabbi Hiyya<sup>15</sup><i class=""footnote"">Son of Adda.</i>, Rab<sup>16</sup><i class=""footnote"">Abba Arika.</i>, Rabbi Yannai<sup>17</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Great.</i>, Bar Koppara<sup>18</sup><i class=""footnote"">Eleazar son of Eleazar ha-Koppar.</i>, Samuel, Rabbi Johanan<sup>20</sup><i class=""footnote"">Son of Nappaha.</i>, and Rabbi Hoshaia<sup>21</sup><i class=""footnote"">The Great. G.</i>. They were the principal scholars who received it from him, but along with them were thousands even tens of thousands of among the rest of his contemporary scholars."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.10","Although all of these eleven scholars received it from our Holy Master and regularly attended his lectures, Rabbi Johanan was then in his minority, and thereafter became the disciple of Rabbi Yannai from whom he received the Oral Torah. So did Rab receive it from Rabbi Yannai; but Samuel received it from Hanina son of Hama."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.11","Rab compiled the Sifra and Sifre to elucidate and proclaim the principles of the Mishna; Rabbi Hiyya compiled the Tosefta to elucidate the treatises of the Mishna; Rabbi Hoshaiah and Bar Koppara compiled the Braitot to elucidate the texts of the Mishna; and Rabbi Johanan compiled the Jerusalemean Talmud in Eretz Yisrael, close to the third century after the destruction of the (Second) Temple."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.12","Among the principal scholars who received the Oral Torah from Rab and Samuel were: Rab Huna, Rab Judah, Rab Nahman and Rab Kahana: and among the principal scholars who received it from Rabbi Johanan were: Rabba Bar Bar Hana, Rab Ami, Rab Assi, Rab Dimi, and Rab Abin. Among the scholars who received it from Rab Huna and Rab Judah were: Rabba and Rab Joseph; among the scholars who received it from Rabba and Rab Joseph were: Abayya and Raba, yet both of them received it also from Rab Nahman; among the scholars who received it from Raba were: Rab Ashi and Rabina; and Mar the son of Rab Ashi received it from his father and from Rabina."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.13","Consequently there are forty intervening generations from Rab Ashi till Moses our Master, peace be to him! namely: (1) Rab Ashi received the Oral Torah from Raba; (2) Raba from Rabba; (3) Rabba from Rab Huna; (4) Rab Huna from Rabbi Johanan and from Rab and Samuel; (5) Rabbi Johanan and Rab and Samuel from our Holy Master; (6) our Holy Master from Rabbi Simeon his father; (7) Rabbi Simeon from his father Rabbin Gamaliel; (8) Rabbin Gamaliel from his father Rabbin Simeon; (9) Rabbin Simeon from his father Rabbin Gamaliel the Elder; (10) Rabbin Gamaliel the Elder from his father Rabbin Simeon; (11) Rabbin Simeon from his father Hillel and from Shammai; (12) Hillel and Shamai from Shemaiah and Abtalion; (13) Shemaiah and Abtalion from Judah and Simeon; (14) Judah and Simeon from Joshua son of Perahyah and Nittai of Arbela; (15) Joshua and Nittai from Jose son of Joezer and Joseph son of Johanan; (16) Jose son of Joezer and Joseph son of Johanan from Antigonus (17) Antigonus from Simeon the Just; (18) Simeon the Just from Ezra; (19) Ezra from Baruch; (20) Baruch from Jeremiah; (21) Jeremiah from Zephanaiah; (22) Zephanaiah from Habakkuk; (23) Habakkuk from Nahum; (24) Nahum from Joel; (25) Joel from Micha; (26) Micha from Isaiah; (27) Isaiah from Amos; (28) Amos from Hosea; (29) Hosea from Zachariah; (30) Zachariah from Jehoiadah; (31) Jehoiadah from Elisha; (32) Elisha from Elijah; (33) Elijah from Ahijah; (34) Ahijah from David; (35) David from Samuel; (36) Samuel from Eli; (37) Eli from Phinehas; (38) Phinehas from Joshua; (39) Joshua from Moses our Master; (40) Moses our Master from the Word of Almighty. Thus it is established that all of them received it from the Lord God of Israel."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.14","All of the hereinabove named scholars were the greatest men in their respective generations; some were heads of schools, others exilarchs, and still others heads of the Great Sanhedrin; and with them were their contemporaries in each and every generation numbering in the thousands, even tens of thousands who heard the Oral Torah being expounded together with them, or received it from them."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.15",Rabina and RabAshi flourished at the close of the era of Talmudic scholars. Rab Ashi is he who compiled the Babylonian Talmud in the land of Shinar about a century after Rabbi Johanan compiled the Jerusalemean Talmud.
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.16","The scope of both Talmudic works comprises an exposition defining the text of the Mishna, elucidatory commentaries upon its complexities, and a survey of the legal precedents established by the succeeding tribunals during the intervening period between our Holy Master and the compilation of the Talmud. And, out of both Talmudic works, the Tosefta, Sifra, Sifre (and Additions), from it all is derived what is forbidden and what is permitted, what is polluted and what is clean, what is guilt and what is innocence, what is disqualified and what is fit, all as it was transmitted orally from man to man, from the mouth of Moses our Master, even from Sinai."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.17","Therefrom are also derived the edicta issued by the scholars and prophets in each and every generation to safeguard the Torah itself, as they heard it clearly from Moses, saying: ""Therefore shall ye keep my charge"" (Lev. 18.30.), which means, ""Build a fence around My Guard"".<sup>26</sup><i class=""footnote"">Mo'ed Katan 5a. S.</i>"
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.18","Likewise are the customs and by-laws, which were inaugurated and enacted in each and every generation, by authority of the tribunal of a given generation derived therefrom. Moreover, it is forbidden to deviate from them, even as it is said: ""Thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, nor to the left"" (Deut. 17.11.). Similarly are derived therefrom such laws and judicial pronouncements, otherwise not accredited by tradition to Moses, but legislated by a tribunal of a given generation upon authority of the rules by which the Torah is expounded, and were passed upon their merits by the Elders, who decided that such should be the law. The entire scope of it all, extending from the days of Moses even to his day, Rab Ashi compiled."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.19","In addition, the scholars of the Mishnaic period compiled divers works of exegesis on the text of the Torah. Rabbi Hoshaia, a disciple of our Holy Master, compiled an exegetical work on the Book of Genesis; Rabbi Ishmael compiled a work of commentaries extending from Exodus till the end of the Torah; this work is called Mehilta; Rabbi Akiba, too, compiled a Mehilta; and other scholars, in a later period, compiled Midrashic literature; but all of those were edited prior to the compilation of the Babylonian Talmud."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.20","Consequently, Rabina and Rab Ashi and their Associates were the last of the great scholars in Israel who edited the Oral Torah, issued edicts, enacted statutes and established customs; and their edicts, statutes, and customs were universally accepted by Israel in all the places of their habitation."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.21","After the tribunal of Rab Ashi, who compiled the Talmud, which was completed in the days of his son<sup>27</sup><i class=""footnote""> Mar. G.</i>, the extent of Israel's dispersion throughout the lands became more general, its extreme points reaching out to distant isles, in the midst of which universal unrest became alarming, making the highways unsafe on account of military operations, as a result of which the study of the Torah was neglected, and the sons of Israel ceased flocking to their schools in the thousands and in the tens of thousands as theretofore, save only the gathering of a remnant few, who ever hear the call of God in each and every city and in each and every country and study the Torah and understand all the works of the scholars and learn to know therefrom the path of the law as it is. Thus, every tribunal, founded during the post-Talmudic era in each and every country which issued edicts, or enacted statutes, or established customs, either for the inhabitants of its own country alone or for the inhabitants of many countries, did not have its authority extended throughout all Israel, because of the great distances between their habitations and the unsafe condition of the highways. Moreover, as the tribunal of a given state consisted of individual scholars only, for the Great Tribunal of seventy one had ceased to be many years before the compilation of the Talmud, the people of one state could therefore, not be forced to inaugurate the custom of another state; neither could one tribunal be told to issue edicts similar to the edicts issued by another tribunal for its own state. Likewise, if one of the Gaonim instructed concerning a given law in a particular way, and it became clear to another tribunal which rose up after him, that such was not the way of the law according to the text of the Talmud, the first one is not supported but the one whose interpretation is based upon sound reasoning, whether he be the first one or the last one."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.22","These rules apply only to laws, edicts, statutes and customs which were inaugurated during the post-Talmudic era; but all matters named in the Babylonian Talmud itself, are mandatory upon all Israel to follow, and each and every community and each and every state must be forced to inaugurate the customs which were promulgated by the Talmudic scholars, to proclaim their edicts and to obey their statutes, because to all such matters so named in the Talmud, all Israel assented. Moreover, those scholars who enacted statutes, issued edicts, inaugurated customs or made judicial pronouncements and instructed that such was the law, constituted all, or a majority of the scholars in Israel, and they were the recipients of the traditional interpretation of the precepts of the whole Torah, generation after generation, even unto Moses our Master, peace be unto him!"
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.23","All of the scholars who rose up after the compilation of the Talmud and builded upon it, thereby gaining fame for their scholarship, are called Gaonim. All the Gaonim who flourished in Eretz Yisrael, in the land of Shinar, in Spain and in France studied searchingly the path of the Talmud, and brought to light its hidden mysteries, and clarified its treatises, for its path is an extremely deep path, Moreover, being written in Aramaic, blended with other languages, a vernacular understood by the inhabitants of Shinar when the Talmud was compiled; whereas in other places, and even in Shinar during the period of the Gaonim, no man understood that language unless he received special instructions therein. In addition the people of each and every city propounded many questions to their contemporary Gaonim for the elucidation of impenetrable texts in the Talmud, to whom the latter responded according to their wisdom, and such interrogators collected the responsa in book form, out of which they gained understanding. The Gaonim in each and every generation compiled also exegetical works on the Talmud, some of among them interpreted particular laws; of among others particular chapters which had been the subject of inquiry in his days, and of among still others, whole Tractates and Orders. They also compiled treatises on judicial decisions concerning that which is forbidden, or permitted, guilt or innocence, matters which were the need of the hour, so as to keep in touch with education, even he who is not capable of penetrating the depths of the Talmud. Of such was the Godly work of the Gaonim in Israel from the close of the Talmud even till this time, which is in the eighth year after the eleventh century since the destruction of the (Second) Temple, and which is also the year four thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven since the creation of the world."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.24","In this age, with afflictions mightily intensified, the pressure of the hour weighing heavily upon everybody, when the wisdom of our wise did perish and the prudence of our prudent was hid, all commentaries, treatises, and responsa which the Gaonim compiled and considered by them as clear text are preplexities in our day and only a select few comprehend the subject matter thereof, not to speak of the Talmud itself, both the Babylonian and the Jerusalemean, the Sifra, Sifre and Tosefta, which require a broad understanding, a soul endowed with wisdom and lengthy reflection whenafter one may find the right path therein, to ascertain the things which are forbidden and the things which are permitted, or to fathom the how and why of the other laws of the Torah."
"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.25","Therefore, have I, Moses son of Maimon, of Spain, girded up my loins, and, supporting myself upon the Rock, blessed be He! made a comprehensive study of all those books and minded myself to construct out of all these compilations a clear summary on the subject of that which is forbidden or permitted, defiled or clean along with the other laws of the Torah, the whole scope in pure language and concise style, so that the Oral Torah be entirely methodical in the mouth of everybody, without query and without repartee, without the contentious thus of one and such of another, but clear text, cohesive, correct, in harmony with the law which is defined out of all these existing compilations and commentaries from the days of our Holy Master till now; so that all laws b open to young and old, whether they be laws concerning each and every commandment or whether they be laws concerning matters instituted by scholars and prophets. The main object of the matter being, that no man shall have a need of any other compilation in the world for any law of the laws of Israel, but this compilation shall be a cyclopedia of the whole Oral Torah together with a code of the statutes, customs and edicts which were enacted since the days of Moses our Master until the close of the Talmud, even as they were interpreted for us by the Gaonim in all their compilations which were compiled by them since the Talmudic era. Therefore, have I named this compilation Mishnah Torah; for, when one studies Holy Writ first and thereafter reads this Work, he obtains herefrom a complete knowledge of the Oral Torah, having no need to read any other book in between them. I have also minded myself to divide this work in treatises, each treatise comprising a given subject; the treatises were subdivided into chapters, and the chapters into small sections, so that it may serve as an index suitable to memorize it by heart. The range of the treatises of each and every subject varies; some embrace only the laws of a single commandment, as for example, a commandment around which much traditional matter was constructed, which is in reality a subject by itself; other treatises embrace the laws of many commandments, if they are commandments concerning one subject; because the division of this compilation is according to subjects, not according to the number of commandments; as it appears plainly to the reader. The number of the commandments of the Torah, which are established for all generations, is six hundred and thirteen, of which two hundred and forty eight are mandatory; a numerical comparison to the members in a human body, and three hundred and sixty-five prohibitive, a numerical comparison to the days of the solar year."

"Glazer_Vol1, TRANSMISSION OF THE ORAL TORAH.27","Samuel was placed correctly (Baba Mezia, 85b); Johanan and Hoshaia, too, belong there (Hullin, 137b, and 141a); as for Yannai and Bar Koppara, they belong to the great of his day and should not be excluded. The omission of Levi etc. is no error, as Maimonides names only the principal scholars of that generation as the chief recipients. C."
