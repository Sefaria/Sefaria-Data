But now, since the Creator ceded this power from His Hand to the hand of the man himself, His knowledge can not be said to be a decree, but it is similar to the knowledge of the astrologists who know by another power what the conduct of a certain person would be. And, it is common knowledge that from the smallest to the biggest thing which happens to man the Creator transmitted to the power of the planets, only He endowed him with an intelligence to sustain himself, and be delivered from the influence of the planet, and this very same is the power endowed to man to be either good or bad, and only the Creator knows the power of the planet and its movements whether it be within the power of the intelligence of one to be delivered from its influence or not.

As for the <small>RABD</small>'s attempt to make a comparison between the knowledge of the Creator and that of the astrologist, it is evident that he was still under a certain influence of a school of thinkers to which, evidently, Maimonides did not belong.

But of, this Verse ""And this people will rise up, and go astray after the foreign gods of the land"", we long ago suggested that in the subject of the foreknowledge of God there is no connection with predestination, much less can it be utilized here, seeing that even Moses said: ""For I know that after my death ye will in any wise deal corruptly"" (Deut. 31.29), and preceding this he, moreover, said: ""Behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord; and how much more after my death?"". How much more, then could the Creator speak thus without it being a decree? As for the subject of the Egyptians, it is no question at all for two reasons: first, it is a known doctorine that God inflicts no punishment against a wicked man unless it be through a more wicked man than he, whenafter that wicked man will have retribution visited upon him; For, so it is said: ""O Ashur, the rod of Mine anger"", (Is. 10.5), but, ""When thou hast ceased to spoil, thou shalt be spiled"" (Ibid. 33.1); because of thy wickedness, and haughtiness of thy heart, and vain glory against Me. The Egyptians, too, were wicked and it was meet that they receive the plagues; yet, if they had listened to Moses at first and let the children of Irsael go forth, they would neither have been plagued nor drowned in the Red Sea; but the spitefulness of Pharoah, and his insulting words against the Creator in the presence of His messenger caused the punishment to be visited upon him. Second, because the Creator said: ""And they shall afflict them"" (Gen. 15.13), but they afflicted them with rigour, put some of them to death, and killed others by drowning, as the subject is spoken of saying: ""I was but a little angry, but they helped for evil"" (Zech. 1.15); they were, therefore, found guilty"". Rabbi Abraham De Butin, too, criticises Maimonides for delving into this subject again, after he already gave his opinion that we can not comprehend the foreknowledge of God in the preceding chapter. The RiTBa, in defending Maimonides, here falls in an error regarding the <small>RABD</small>, by attributing to him knowledge of Kabalah, an attribute belonging to <small>RABD</small> I. With all the commentaries silent, it is evident that, as far as this defence of the doctorine of self-will versus predestination is concerned, it must be considered weak. The text of this paragraph, however, lends itself to very strong points. The parallelism herein contained is more than of passing strength. Of course, Maimonides establishes the ultimate point upon Faith; but his arguments are chiefly directed to offset contradictions to the Torah. In this he succeeded. The <small>RABD</small>, too, upholds the doctorine of choice of action as against predestination. C.G.</i>"

Behold, they have said: ""<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'>The righteous are prepared to rise up in their garments, deduct major from minor, by comparison of a grain of wheat"" (Ketubot, 111b); and they left instructions to their children, saying: ""Bury us not in either white or black garments, lest I be meritorious and be resurrected"" (Shabbat, 114b); and they have again said: ""The righteous will never again return unto dust, but remain standing in their concrete form"" (Sanhedrin, 92a); and yet again they said: ""They will rise in their deformities, but will be healed"" (Ibid. 91b). All of which is conclusive proof that the dead will arise with their bodies and remain alive. Nevertheless, it is possible that the Creator will set them in strong, healthy forms as are the forms of angels, and as is the form of Elijah, of good memory!, when the garlands, too, will be literally and naturally, not in similitude"". Evidently the <small>RABD</small> erred in placing the World to Come instead of resurrection. <small>RAB</small> (Berakot, 17a) is authority for the contents of this paragraph in the Maimoni text, in so far as the World to Come is concerned.

The accepted doctorine, according to all commentaries on Maimonides is this: The dead will be resurrected. Life will then go on for a time. Then life as we know it will cease completely, when the era of the World to Come will be inaugurated.

But the text in the Talmud (Abodah Zarah, 50bâ€“51) indicates this: The scholars who maintain that slaughtering of a locust carries no guilt, also maintain that idolatry worship has no offshoots; so is the opinion of the one who maintains that a crippled animal, carries no guilt. But Rab Judah and Rab Nahman on behalf on Rab (Abba Ariha) follow Rabbi Judah and the instructor concerning feces, and so is also the law that anything resembling slaughtering or casting of a substance which is breakable is guilty, even though its mode of worship is not so. Moreover, Rab Judah, in maintaining that an idol who is worshiped with a rod shall not be by breaking it or casting it but by another manner, teaches an innovation, that although its mode of service is with a rod, if he casts it he is guiltless, because its service is not by casting and because its substance does not break up"".<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> Maimonides herein decides in harmony with the highest authorities. It is not a question of the act being dignified. On the contrary, the act of slaughtering was a practice in the Court of the Temple, yet, because such species were not to be offered, he is held guiltless. As for the practices mentioned herein by Maimonides, it is a verbatim quotation from Abodah Zarah, 50b 51a, and is of historical and of academic importance, particularly to the student of comparative religions in the ancient times. Neither is there even a trace of exaggeration in the Talmudic portraiture of possibilities and eventualities.

THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""But an individual idolater who appoints a day as holy time to himself etc. According to the text of the Gemara the king's birthday is considered as any other of their holidays, which have the features of such; but the day of shaving one's beard or queue and so all the rest herein enumerated, whether it be the king or subject, no other but that particular day is forbidden time. But the subjects are not banned unless they actually worship them, even if it be on the Calenda (Pagan New Year) and Saturnalia (Pagan watch Night) holidays. As for the exception of ""<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'>that particular man"" in the text, it merely eliminates his subjects, and covers all the enumerated private holidays."" Maimonides interpretes the text of the Mishnah (Abodah Zarah, 8a) this way: (a) General holidays; (2) private holidays (3)subjects. And, in this way he outlines the laws herein; the dependents of a layman are the same to him as the subjects of a king, which he mentions in the third category. The <small>RABD</small>'s criticism, being based on the interpretation of the text of the Mishnah, by which his intention is to point out that the three days before a holiday is inapplicable as regards subjects, falls short of contradicting Maimonides. C.G.</i>"
THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""A city wherein there is an established idolatry etc. The Tosefta identifies this as pertaining to Fair Day and to do business with them. And, even to go there on a holiday is forbidden for fear of doing business with them"".<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> The interpretation of the text is given by Maimonides shows no place for differences.

THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""But if there is another road etc. His words are not consequential at all; if they go from there to another place, it is permitted in the first place to pass through it en route to another place, as there is no place for suspicion here"".<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> Maimonides mentions ""if he merely chanced to take this one"" as a matter of course, for if there are two roads leading to that city he, too, admits that travellers may go there by any road they may elect. C.G.</i>"
THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""One who sells a house etc. If he received the money before the worshiped idol was placed therein, it is permitted property"".<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> The decision of Maimonides herein refers to one who sells his house direct to an idolator, for the purpose of idolatry, when, even, if it was sold on a mortgage, or if the money be given before actual worship, no difference is apparent. C.G.</i>"
THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""But one may lease houses to them for storage. Provided it be not storage for wine; if he made it such the rental is forbidden property"".<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> Maimonides had no need to repeat that the proceeds of idolatry is forbidden property. C.</i>"
THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""But during the interval etc. I do not agree with him in so far as the settling of the idolater is concerned,""<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> Since he assumed the seven commandments why not permit him? Neither does Maimonides forbid the idolater to assume the obligation of the seven commandments; he merely states the law that the tribunal does not receive him, which does not at all prevents his residence in Eretz Yisrael. C. G.</i>"
THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""For even etc. This we did not find nor have we ever heard of it. The Verse which he quotes speaks only of settlement, but not of passing through, and refers only to the seven Canaanite nations"".<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> Maimonides deducts this law from the admonition ""lest they make thee sin"", which is applicable to idolaters alike, and to settlers as well as travellers. C. G.</i>"
THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""He shall not build public places etc. I do not know what this means, if he refers to the charge not to make in them figures as they do, or not to set up therein suns as a sign to invite the public as they do"".<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> Maimonides merely refers here to architectural design. C. G.</i>"
THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""So, too, is one who sets certain signs for himself etc. This is a gross error, for such thing is, indeed, permitted. Perhaps the text (Hullin, 95b) misled him, as he saw there, saying:""<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> Such divination which is not like the divination of Eliezer(Gen. 24. 13â€“14) and Jonathan (I. Samuel, 20. 21â€“22) is not considered divining"", and he evidently thought that the subject there is concerning a charge against such practice. Whereas it is not all so, for the meaning thereof is this: It is not proper to depend upon it. I wonder how he could think that way of such righteous men. Indeed, had they been present when he said it, they would have applied tongues of fire to his face"". Maimonides does not quote the text verbatim, as he omits Jonathan. Eliezer was of the sons of Noah, against whom no charge of divination holds. He really acted in full reliance upon the sign he set for himself by giving her the presents without inquiring as to who she was. Such is forbidden to an Israelite. Jonathan merely set a sign to caution his lad. He did not practice divination, as he was righteous in his observance of the laws of the Torah. The text (Hullin, 95b) does refer to a charge against such practice, what Jonathan did, if one believes it divination. Maimonides deserves no tongues of flame in his face; here as everywhere he shines like a beacon of light. C. G.</i>"
THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""All such and the like is permitted etc. Even this what they said (Hullin, 95b) 'House, suckling and woman although not divination yet it is a sign', was not said by them on the subject of whether such is forbidden or permitted, but as to its reliability, if it is proper to rely upon the pre-figurement thereof, and they declared that it is proper to rely upon such only after the third time, when there is a presumption of reliability in their favor"".<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> Maimonides interprets this concerning matters which already had come to pass, not of what is to happen in the future. Even the interpretation of Rashi (Ibid. q. v.) is not free from amazement regarding ""suckling"" mentioned in the text, which he claims that it refers to a newly-born babe. C. G.</i>"

THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""Although a woman may round the corners of her own head etc. For transgressing this no lashes are inflicted either for rounding an adult or minor, for it is forbidden by Rabbinical statute only, and is deducted from what Rab Ada Bar Ahaba said to Rab Hunah: 'May Habah bury her children!' (Nazir, 57b). This criticism is entirely out of place. Our master does not say that she is striped, but that it is forbidden. C. G."
THE TREATISE CONCERNING WORSHIPERS OF STARS AND THEIR PRACTICES,"""One who picks white hairs etc. It is not established that he should be striped for picking on ehair, first, it is but said that it is forbidden, and again what kind of woman's ornament can there be by plucking out one hair which can not at all be of any material difference in his appearance"".<sup>*</sup><i class='footnote'> The text (Makkot, 20b) clearly indicates that even one hair establishes guilt.

The laws mentioned by R<small>ABD</small>., Maimonides mentions in their proper place; here he only enumerates the transgressions for which man and woman are excommunicated. Moreover, he was loathe to add to the number because of the universal aversion among scholars to pronounce ostracism against a scholar, even against one of a universally evil reputation, saying that one of such character long ceased to be counted in among scholars.

Maimonides contends that a scholar releases himself even in a matter where separation is justified, basing his decision on Mo'ed Katan 17a, and Nedarim, 7a. The apparent contradiction of Judah, is no contradiction at all, as Judah bound himself to bring Benjamin back, which is a bond to perform a definite thing, in which case Maimonides does not sanction the release by one's own self. Jacob did not release him, because Judah brought Benjamin back and delivered to Jacob, which was sufficient ground to believe that there was no need for a release. C. G.</i>"
