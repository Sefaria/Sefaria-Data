<title>TRANSMISSION OF ORAL LAW</title>
<p>Then shall I not be ashamed when I look to all thy commandments (Ps. 119:6).</p>
<p>All the precepts which Moses received on Sinai, were given together with their interpretation, as it is said &#x201C;And I will give unto thee the tables of stone, and the law, and the commandment.&#x201D; (Exodus 24:12). &#x201C;The law&#x201D; refers to the Written Law; &#x201C;and the commandment,&#x201D; to its interpretation. God bade us fulfil the Law in accordance with &#x201C;the commandment.&#x201D; This commandment refers to that which is called the Oral Law. The whole of the Law was written by Moses, our teacher, before his death, in his own hand. He presented a scroll to each tribe and deposited one in the Ark for a testimony, as it is said &#x201C;Take this book of the law and put it by the side of the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness against thee&#x201D; (Deut. 31:26). &#x201C;The commandment,&#x201D; which is the Interpretation of the Law, he did not write down but gave a charge concerning it to the Elders, to Joshua and to the rest of Israel, as it is said &#x201C;All this which I command you, that shall ye observe to do; thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.&#x201D; (Deut. 4:2). Hence, it is styled the Oral Law.</p>
<p>Although the Oral Law was not committed to writing, Moses taught the whole of it, in his court, to the seventy elders as well as to Eleazar, Phineas and Joshua &#x2014; all three of whom received it from Moses. To Joshua, his disciple, our teacher, Moses, delivered the Oral Law and charged him concerning it. So too, Joshua, throughout his life, taught orally. Many elders received the Oral Law from Joshua. Eli received it from the elders and from Phineas. Samuel, from Eli and his court. David, from Samuel and his court. Ahijah, the Shilonite, was among those who had come forth from Egypt. He was a Levite and had heard the Law from Moses, in his childhood. He received the Oral Law from David and his court. Elijah received it from Ahijah, the Shilonite, and his court. Elisha, from Elijah and his court. Jehoiada the Priest, from Elisha and his court. Zechariah, from Jehoiada and his court. Hosea, from Zechariah and his court. Amos, from Hosea and his court. Isaiah, from Amos and his court. Micah, from Isaiah and his court. Joel, from Micah and his court. Nahum, from Joel and his court. Habakkuk, from Nahum and his court. Zephaniah, from Habakkuk and his court. Jeremiah, from Zephaniah and his court. Baruch, the son of Neriah, from Jeremiah and his court. Ezra and his court received it from Baruch and his court. The members of Ezra&#x2019;s court are called &#x201C;The Men of the Great Synagogue.&#x201D; They were Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah, Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah, Mordecai, Zerubabel and many other sages, numbering altogether one hundred and twenty elders. The last of them was Simon the Just, who is included among the hundred and twenty. He received the Oral Law from all of them and was a high priest after Ezra. Antigonos of Socho and his court received the Oral Law from Simon the Just and his court. Jos&#x00E9;, the son of Joezer of Zeredah, and Joseph, the son of Johanan of Jerusalem, and their court, from Antigonos and his court. Joshua, the son of Perahiah, and Nitai the Arbelite and their court, from Jos&#x00E9; the son of Joezer and Joseph the son of Johanan and their court. Judah, the son of Tabbai, and Simeon, the son of Shetah and their court received from Joshua, the son of Perahiah and Nitai the Arbelite and their court. Shemaiah and Abtalion, proselytes of righteousness,<xref rid="fn1">&#x002A;</xref> and their court received from Judah and Simon and their court. Hillel and Shammai and their court received from Shemaiah and Abtalion and their court. Rabban Johanan, the son of Zaccai, and Rabban Simeon, the son of Hillel received from Hillel and his court. Rabban Johanan ben Zaccai had five disciples who were the most distinguished among the scholars who received the Oral Law from him. They were Rabbi Eliezer the Great,<xref rid="fn2">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> Rabbi Joshua, Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; the Priest, Rabbi Simeon, the son of Nathaniel and Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Arach. Rabbi Akiba, the son of Joseph, received the Oral Law from Rabbi Eliezer the Great. Joseph, his father, was a proselyte of righteousness. Rabbi Ishmael and Rabbi Meir, the son of a proselyte of righteousness<xref rid="fn1">&#x002A;</xref>, received the Oral Law from Rabbi Akiba. Rabbi Meir and his colleagues also received it from Rabbi Ishmael. The colleagues of Rabbi Meir were Rabbi Judah, Rabbi Jos&#x00E9;, Rabbi Simeon, Rabbi Nehemiah, Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Shammua, Rabbi Johanan, the sandal-maker, Simeon the son of Azzai and Rabbi Hananiah the son of Teradion. Rabbi Akiba&#x2019;s colleagues received the Oral Law also from Rabbi Eliezer the Great. The colleagues of Rabbi Akiba were Rabbi Tarfon, the teacher of Rabbi Jos&#x00E9; the Galilean, Rabbi Simeon, the son of Eleazar, and Rabbi Johanan, the son of Nuri. Rabban Gamaliel the Elder received the Oral Law from Rabban Simeon, his father, a son of Hillel the Elder. Rabban Simeon, his son, received it from him. Rabban Gamaliel, his son, received it from him. Rabban Simeon, his son, received it from him. Rabbi Judah, the son of Rabban Simeon, is the Rabbi, called Our Teacher, the Saint. He received the Law from his father and from Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Shammua and from Rabbi Simeon, his father&#x2019;s colleagues. Our Teacher, the Saint, compiled the Mishnah. From the time of Moses to that of Our Teacher, the Saint, no work had been composed from which the Oral Law was publicly taught. But in each generation, the head of the then existing court or the prophet of that time wrote down for his private use a memorandum of the traditions which he had heard from his teachers, and which he taught orally in public. So too, every student wrote down, according to his ability, the exposition of the Torah and of its laws, as he heard them, as well as the new matter evolved in each generation, which had not been received by tradition but had been deduced by application of the thirteen hermeneutical rules and had been adopted by the Supreme Court. This was the method in vogue till the time of Our Teacher, the Saint.</p>
<p>He gathered together all the traditions, enactments, interpretations and expositions of every portion of the Torah, that had either come down from Moses, our Master, or had been deduced by the courts in successive generations. All this material he redacted in the Mishnah, which was diligently taught in public, and thus became universally known among the Jewish people. Copies of it were made and widely disseminated, so that the Oral Law might not be forgotten in Israel.</p>
<p>Why did Our Teacher, the Saint, act so and not leave things as they were? Because he observed that the number of disciples was diminishing, fresh calamities were continually happening, the wicked Government was extending its domain and increasing in power, and Israelites were wandering and emigrating to distant countries. He therefore composed a work to serve as a handbook for all, and the contents of which could be rapidly studied and would not be forgotten. Throughout his life, he and his colleagues were engaged in giving public instruction in the Mishnah. Among the sages who were members of our sainted master&#x2019;s court and received instruction in the Oral Law from him, the following were the most distinguished: his sons, Simeon and Gamaliel; Rabbi Efes; Rabbi Yohanan and Rabbi Hoshaia. These were the most illustrious of the sages who received instruction from him; besides thousands and tens of thousands other scholars. Although these eleven are named as having received instruction from our sainted teacher and attended his college, Rabbi Yohanan was a child at the time, and, at a subsequent period, a pupil of Rabbi Yannai from whom he received instruction. Rav also received instruction from Rabbi Yannai; as Samuel did from Rabbi Hanina, son of Hama. Rav compiled the <italic>Sifra</italic> and the <italic>Sifr&#x00E9;,</italic> the purpose of which is to expound and teach the principles of the Mishnah. R. Hiya compiled the <italic>Tosefta,</italic> to explain the subject matter of the Mishnah. So too, Rabbi Hoshaia and Bar Kappara compiled <italic>Boraithas,</italic> to elucidate the text of the Mishnah. Rabbi Yohanan composed the Jerusalem Talmud in Palestine, approximately three centuries after the destruction of the Second Temple. Among the distinguished sages who received the Law from Rav and Samuel were Rav Huna, Rav Judah, Rav Nahman and Rav Kahana. Among the distinguished sages who received such instruction from Rabbi Johanan were Rabbah, grandson of Hanah, Rav Ami, Rav Asi, Rav Dimi and Rav Abin. Among the sages who were thus instructed by Rav Huna and Rav Judah, were Rabbah and Rav Joseph. Among the disciples of Rabbah and Rav Joseph were Abai&#x00E9; and Rava. The last two were also instructed by Rav Nahman. Among Rava&#x2019;s disciples were Rav Ashi and Ravina. Mar, son of Rav Ashi was instructed by his father, Rav Ashi and by Ravina.</p>
<p>Accordingly, counting back from Rav Ashi to Moses, our teacher, (upon whom be peace), there were forty generations of scholars (who received the Oral Law each from his predecessors in unbroken succession) as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Rav Ashi received from Rava; (2) Rava from Rabbah; (3) Rabbah from Rav Huna; (4)	Rav Huna from Rabbi Johanan, Rav and Samuel;	(5) Rabbi Johanan, Rav and Samuel from Our Teacher, the Saint; (6) Our Teacher, the Saint, from his father, Rabbi Simeon; (7) Rabbi Simeon from his father, Rabban Gamaliel; (8) Rabban Gamaliel from his father, Rabban Simeon; (9) Rabban Simeon from his father, Rabban Gamaliel (the Elder); (10) Rabban Gamaliel (the Elder) from his father, Rabban Simeon; (11) Rabban Simeon from his father, Hillel and from Shammai; (12) Hillel and Shammai from Shemaiah and Abtalion; (13) Shemaiah and Abtalion from Judah and Simeon; (14) Judah and Simeon from Joshua, (the son of Perahiah) and Nitai (the Arbelite); (15) Joshua and Nitai (the Arbelite) from Joseph (the son of Joezer) and Joseph, (the son of Johanan); (16) Joseph, (son of Joezer) and Joseph (son of Johanan) from Antigonos; (17) Antigonos from Simon the Just; (18) Simon the Just from Ezra; (19) Ezra from Baruch; (20) Baruch from Jeremiah; (21) Jeremiah from Zephaniah; (22) Zephaniah from Habakkuk; (23) Habakkuk from Nahum; (24) Nahum from Joel; (25) Joel from Micah; (26) Micah from Isaiah; (27) Isaiah from Amos; (28) Amos from Hosea; (29) Hosea from Zechariah; (30) Zechariah from Jehoiadah; (31) Jehoiadah from Elisha; (32) Elisha from Elijah; (33) Elijah from Ahijah; (34) Ahijah from David; (35) David from Samuel; (36) Samuel from Eli; (37) Eli from Phineas; (38) Phineas from Joshua; (39) Joshua from Moses, our teacher; (40) Moses, our teacher, the teacher of all prophets, from the Eternal, God of Israel.</p>
<p>All the sages here mentioned were the great men of the successive generations; some of them were presidents of colleges, some exilarchs, and some were members of the great Synhedria; besides them were thousands and myriads of disciples and fellow-students. Ravina and Rav Ashi closed the list of the sages of the Talmud. Rav Ashi it was who compiled the Babylonian Talmud in the land of Shinar (Babylon), about a century after Rabbi Johanan had compiled the Jerusalem Talmud. These two Talmuds contain an exposition of the text of the Mishnah and an elucidation of its abstruse points and of the new subject-matter that had been added by the various courts from the days of Our Teacher, the Saint, till the compilation of the Talmud. The two Talmuds, the <italic>Tosefta,</italic> the <italic>Sifra</italic> and the <italic>Sifr&#x00E9;,</italic> and the <italic>Toseftoth</italic> are the sources, from all of which is elucidated what is forbidden and what is permitted, what is unclean and what is clean, what is a penal violation and what involves no penalty, what is fit to be used and what is unfit for use, all in accordance with the traditions received by the sages from their predecessors in unbroken succession up to the teachings of Moses as he received them on Sinai. From these sources too, are ascertained the decrees, instituted by the sages and prophets, in each generation, to serve as a protecting fence about the Law, in accordance with Moses&#x2019; express injunction, &#x201C;Ye shall keep my charge&#x201D; (Lev. 18:30), that is, &#x201C;Ordain a charge to preserve My charge.&#x201D; From these sources a clear conception is also obtained of the customs and ordinances, either formally introduced in various generations by their respective authorities or that came into use with their sanction; from these it is forbidden to depart, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not turn aside from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand; nor to the left.&#x201D; (Deut. 17:11). So too these works contain the clearly established judgments and rules not received from Moses, but which the Supreme Court of each generation deduced by applying the hermeneutical principles for the interpretation of the Law, and which were decided by those venerable authorities to be the law,&#x2014;all of which, accumulated from the days of Moses to his own time, Rav Ashi put together in the Gemara. The sages of the Mishnah composed other works to expound the words of the Torah. Rabbi Hoshiah, a disciple of Our Teacher, the Saint, wrote an exposition of the book of Genesis; and Rabbi Ishmael, a commentary on the Pentateuch, from the beginning of the book of Exodus to the end of the Pentateuch. This work is called Mechilta. Rabbi Akiba also wrote a Mechilta. Other sages, who lived subsequently, compiled Midrashim. All these works were composed before the Babylonian Talmud. Ravina and Rav Ashi and their colleagues were the last of the great sages who firmly established the Oral Law, made decrees, and ordinances and introduced customs. Their decrees, ordinances and customs obtained universal acceptance among Israelites wherever they settled.</p>
<p>After the Court of Rav Ashi, who compiled the Gemara which was finally completed in the days of his son, an extraordinarily great dispersion of Israel throughout the world took place. The people emigrated to remote parts and distant isles. The prevalence of wars and the march of armies made travel insecure. The study of the Torah declined. The Jewish people did not flock to the colleges in their thousands and tens of thousands as heretofore; but in each city and country, individuals who felt the divine call gathered together and occupied themselves with the Torah; studies all the works of the sages; and from these, learnt the method of legal interpretation.</p>
<p>If a court established in any country, after the time of the Talmud, made decrees and ordinances or introduced customs for those residing in its particular country or for residents of other countries, its enactments did not obtain the acceptance of all Israel because of the remoteness of the Jewish settlements and the difficulties of travel. And as the court of any particular country consisted of individuals (whose authority was not universally recognised), while the Supreme Court of seventy-one members had, several years before the compilation of the Talmud, ceased to exist, no compulsion is exercised on those living in one country to observe the customs of another country; nor is any court directed to issue a decree that had been issued by another court in the same country. So too, if one of the <italic>Geonim</italic> taught that a certain way of judgment was correct, and it became clear to a court at a later date that this was not in accordance with the view of the Gemara, the earlier authority is not necessarily followed but that view is adopted which seems more reasonable, whether it be that of an earlier or later authority.</p>
<p>The foregoing observations refer to rules, decrees, ordinances and customs that originated after the Talmud had been compiled. But whatever is already mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud is binding on all Israel. And every city and country is bound to observe all the customs observed by the sages of the Gemara, promulgate their decrees, and uphold their institutions, on the ground that all these customs, decrees and institutions mentioned in the Talmud received the assent of all Israel, and those sages who instituted the ordinances, issued the decrees, introduced the customs, gave the decisions and taught that a certain ruling was correct, constituted the total body or the majority of Israel&#x2019;s wise men. They were the leaders who received from each other the traditions concerning the fundamentals of Judaism, in unbroken succession back to Moses, our teacher, upon whom be peace.</p>
<p>The sages, however, who arose after the compilation of the Talmud, studied it deeply, and became famous for their wisdom, are those called Geonim. All these Geonim who flourished in the land of Israel(<sup><xref rid="fn3">1</xref></sup>), Shinar(<sup><xref rid="fn4">2</xref></sup>), Spain and France, taught the method of the Talmud, elucidated its obscurities, and expounded the various topics with which it deals. For its method is exceedingly profound. Furthermore, the work is composed in Aramaic mixed with other languages&#x2014;this having been the vernacular of the Babylonian Jews at the time when it was compiled. In other countries, however, as also in Babylon in the days of the Geonim, no one, unless specially taught, understood that dialect. Many application were made to the Gaon of the day by residents of different cities, asking for explanations of difficulties in the Talmud. These, the Geonim answered, according to their ability. Those who had put the questions collected the responses which they made into books for study. The Geonim also, at different periods, composed commentaries on the Talmud. Some of them explained specific laws; others, particular chapters that presented difficulties to their contemporaries; others again expounded complete treatises and entire orders of the Talmud. They also made compilations of settled rules as to things permitted or forbidden, as to infractions which were penal or were not liable to a penalty. All these dealt with matters in regard to which compendia were needed, that could be studied by one not capable of penetrating to the depths of the Talmud. This is the godly work in which all the Geonim of Israel engaged, from the completion of the Talmud to the present date which is the eighth year of the eleventh century after the destruction of the Second Temple.<xref rid="fn5">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>In our days, severe vicissitudes prevail, and all feel the pressure of hard times. The wisdom of our wise men has disappeared; the understanding of our prudent men is hidden. Hence, the commentaries of the Geonim and their compilations of laws and responses, which they took care to make clear, have in our times become hard to understand so that only a few individuals properly comprehend them. Needless to add that such is the case in regard to the Talmud itself&#x2014;the Babylonian as well as the Palestinian&#x2014;the <italic>Sifra,</italic> the <italic>Sifri</italic> and the <italic>Tosefta,</italic> all of which works require, for their comprehension, a broad mind, a wise soul and considerable study, and then one can learn from them the correct practice as to what is forbidden or permitted, and the other rules of the Torah.</p>
<p>On these grounds, I, Moses the son of Maimon <italic>the Sefardi,</italic> bestirred myself, and, relying on the help of God, blessed be He, intently studied all these works, with the view of putting together the results obtained from them in regard to what is forbidden or permitted, clean or unclean, and the other rules of the Torah&#x2014;all in plain language and terse style, so that thus the entire Oral Law might become systematically known to all, without citing difficulties and solutions or differences of view, one person saying so, and another something else,&#x2014;but consisting of statements, clear and convincing, and in accordance with the conclusions drawn from all these compilations and commentaries that have appeared from the time of Moses to the present, so that all the rules shall be accessible to young and old, whether these appertain to the (Pentateuchal) precepts or to the institutions established by the sages and prophets, so that no other work should be needed for ascertaining any of the laws of Israel, but that this work might serve as a compendium of the entire Oral Law, including the ordinances, customs and decrees instituted from the days of our teacher Moses till the compilation of the Talmud, as expounded for us by the <italic>Geonim</italic> in all the works composed by them since the completion of the Talmud. Hence, I have entitled this work <italic>Mishneh Torah</italic> (Repetition of the Law), for the reason that a person, who first reads the Written Law and then this compilation, will know from it the whole of the Oral Law, without having occasion to consult any other book between them.</p>
<p>I have seen fit to arrange this Compendium in large divisions of the laws according to their various topics. These divisions are distributed in chapters grouped according to subject matter. Each chapter is subdivided into smaller paragraphs so that they may be systematically memorized. Among the laws in the various topics, some consist of rules in reference to a single Biblical precept. This would be the case when such a precept is rich in traditional matter and forms a single topic. Other sections include rules referring to several precepts when these all belong to one topic. For the work follows the order of topics and is not planned according to the number of precepts, as will be explained to the reader.</p>
<p>The total number of precepts that are obligatory for all generations is 613. Of these, 248 are affirmative; their mnemonic is the number of bones in the human body. 365 precepts are negative and their mnemonic is the number of days in the solar year.</p>
<p>Blessed be the all-merciful who hath aided us.</p>

That one, not a descendant of Aaron in the male line, shall not serve (in the Sanctuary), as it is said, &#x201C;And a stranger shall not come nigh unto you&#x201D; (Num. 18:4-7). 75. That a priest who is unclean shall not serve (in the Sanctuary), as it is said, &#x201C;(Speak unto Aaron and his sons) that they separate themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel&#x2026;.&#x201D; (Lev. 22:2-3). 76.

Traditionally it was learnt, that this verse refers to the festival offering brought on the fourteenth of Nissan, and the phrase &#x2018;<italic>unto the morning</italic>&#x2019; means until the morning of the second day of Passover, which is the third day from that on which it was killed. 119.

Not to give of the flesh of the Paschal lamb to an Israelite who had become an apostate, as it is said, &#x201C;There shall no stranger eat thereof&#x201D; (Ex. 12:43). That is to say, an Israelite, who joined aliens and worshipped like them, shall not eat of it. 129. That a person who is unclean shall not eat of things that are holy, as it is said, &#x201C;But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace-offerings&#x2026;. (having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people)&#x201D; (Lev. 7:20). 130.

Not to eat of sacrifices that are abhorrent (because it was <italic>intended</italic> to be eaten beyond the appointed time) as it is said, &#x201C;&#x2026;.(And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace-offerings be eaten at all<xref rid="fn24">&#x002A;</xref> on the third day, <italic>it shall not be accepted</italic>); neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it; it shall be an abomination&#x201D; (Lev. 7:18).

That even a sojourner with a priest (Hebrew bondman released in the Jubilee year), or his hired servant (Hebrew bondman released after six years of service) shall not eat of the heave-offering, as it is said, &#x201C;A sojourner of the priest, or an hired servant (shall not eat of the holy thing)&#x201D; (ibid.). 135. That an uncircumcised person shall not eat of the heave-offering; and the same applies to other holy things. This rule is inferred from the law of the Paschal offering, by similarity of phrase (Ex. 12:44-45 and Lev. 22:10); but it is not explicitly set forth in the Torah. Traditionally it has been learnt that the rule that the uncircumcised must not eat holy things is an essential principle of the Torah and not an enactment of the Scribes. 136. That a priest who is unclean shall not eat of the heave-offering, as it is said, &#x201C;Anyone of thy seed&#x2026;. who is a leper or hath an issue&#x2026;. he shall not eat of the holy things&#x2026;.&#x201D; (Lev. 22:3-4). 137.

Not to eat the flesh of beasts set apart as sacrifices, that have been rendered unfit to be offered up by deliberately inflicted blemish, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing&#x201D; (Deut. 14:3). We learn by tradition that this text refers to sacrificial beasts rendered unfit by the infliction of a blemish. 141. Not to eat the second tithe of cereals outside Jerusalem, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn&#x201D; (Deut. 12:17). 142.

Not to eat of the unblemished firstling outside Jerusalem, as it is said, &#x201C;or the firstling (of thy herds or of thy flock)&#x201D; (ibid.). 145. That the priests shall not eat the flesh of the sin-offering or trespass-offering outside the Courtyard (of the Sanctuary); since the text &#x201C;Thou mayest not eat within thy gates&#x201D; (ibid.) applies to whatever is eaten outside the place appointed for its consumption. 146. Not to eat the flesh of the burnt-offering, as it is said, (&#x201C;Thou mayest not (eat within thy gates)&#x2026;. nor any of thy vows which thou vowest&#x201D; (ibid.). This is a prohibition applying to every trespasser, not to enjoy any of the holy things. If he does so, he commits a trespass. 147. Not to eat of the flesh of the sacrifices that are holy in a minor degree<xref rid="fn26">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref>, before the blood has been sprinkled (on the altar), as it is said, &#x201C;Thou mayest not eat&#x2026;. thy free-will offerings&#x201D; (Deut. 12:17); that is, thou mayest not eat thy free-will offerings, till the blood has been sprinkled. 148. That one not of the seed of Aaron, shall not eat the flesh of the holy sacrifices<xref rid="fn27">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref>, as it is said, &#x201C;But a stranger shall not eat thereof, because they are holy&#x201D; (Ex. 29: 33). 149. That the priest shall not eat the first-fruits before they are set down in the Courtyard (of the Sanctuary), as it is said, &#x201C;(Thou mayest not eat within thy gates)&#x2026;. nor heave-offerings of thy hand&#x201D; (Deut. 12:17); this refers to first-fruits. 150.

Not to eat the Second Tithe, when mourning, as it is said, &#x201C;I have not eaten thereof in my mourning&#x201D; (ibid.). 152. Not to expend the proceeds of the second tithe on anything but food and drink, as it is said, &#x201C;Nor given aught thereof for the dead&#x201D;, (ibid.). Anything outside of things necessary for sustenance comes within the class in the phrase &#x201C;Given for the dead&#x201D;. 153. Not to eat <italic>Tevel.</italic> Tevel is produce of the soil, from which heave-offering and tithes have to be separated, so-called before this has been done, as it is said, &#x201C;And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel which they offer to the Lord&#x201D; (Lev. 22:15). This means that things from which a portion has to be separated to the Lord must not be regarded as secular and eaten before the separation has taken place. 154. Not to separate from the produce the heave-offerings (given to the priest), before the first-fruits, nor the first tithe before the heave-offering, nor the second tithe before the first tithe (Levites&#x2019; dues); but the separation should proceed in the due order; first-fruits at the beginning, then the great heave-offering, then the first tithe, and last the second tithe, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not delay the first of thy ripe fruits, and of thy liquors&#x201D; (Ex. 22:28); that is to say, not to defer the offering which should be brought earlier. 155. Not to delay bringing vowed or free-will<xref rid="fn28">&#x002A;</xref> offerings, as it is said, &#x201C;(When thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord, thy God) thou shalt not delay to pay it&#x201D; (Deut. 23:22). 156.

That the High Priest shall not take a widow in marriage, as it is said, &#x201C;A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or a harlot (these shall he not take)&#x201D; (Lev. 21:14). 162. That the High Priest shall not cohabit with a widow, even without marriage, because he profanes her, and it is said, &#x201C;Neither shall he profane his seed among his people&#x201D; (ibid. 21:15). He is thus prohibited from profaning one who would be eligible to be married to a priest. 163. That a priest shall not enter the Sanctuary with dishevelled hair<xref rid="fn29">&#x002A;</xref>, as it is said, &#x201C;Let not the hair of your heads be dishevelled&#x201D; (Lev. 10:6). 164.

That a High Priest shall not go (under the same roof) with a dead body, as it is said, &#x201C;Neither shall he go in unto any dead body (nor defile himself)&#x201D; (ibid. 21:11). It has been learnt by tradition that a priest, who does so, violates the prohibition, &#x201C;Neither shall he go in&#x2026;.&#x201D;, and also the prohibition, &#x201C;He shall not defile himself&#x201D;. 169. That none of the tribe of Levi shall take any portion of territory in the land (of Israel), as it is said, (&#x201C;The priests, the Levites, even all the tribe of Levi) shall have (no portion) nor inheritance (with Israel)&#x201D; (Deut. 18:1). 170.

It is learnt by tradition that one of these texts (Ex. 23:19) refers to the prohibition of boiling, the other (Ex. 34:26), to the prohibition of eating. 188. Not to eat the flesh of an ox that was condemned to be stoned, as it is said, &#x201C;&#x2026;. and its flesh shall not be eaten&#x201D; (Ex. 21:28). 189. Not to eat bread made of new grain before (the Omer of barley has been offered up on the second day of) Passover, as it is said, &#x201C;And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor fresh ears until the self-same day&#x201D;<xref rid="fn31">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> (Lev. 23:14). 190.

This means that the fruit is prohibited to be eaten. 194.

It has been learnt by tradition that this is a prohibition forbidding any such change. 229. Not to forsake the Levites, as it is said, &#x201C;Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite&#x201D; (Deut. 12:19); but their gifts (dues) should be given to them, so that they might rejoice therewith on each and every festival. 230. Not to demand return of a loan after the Sabbatical year has elapsed as it is said, &#x201C;&#x2026;.he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother&#x201D; (Deut. 15:2). 231.

Not to take part in any usurious transaction between borrower and lender, neither as a surety, nor as a witness, nor as a writer of the bond for them, as it is said, &#x201C;Neither shall ye lay upon him usury&#x201D; (Ex. 22:24). 238.

Not to take a pledge from a widow, as it is said, &#x201C;&#x2026;. nor take a widow&#x2019;s raiment as a pledge&#x201D; (Deut. 24:17). 242.

<p>These are the six hundred and thirteen precepts which were orally imparted to Moses on Sinai, together with their general principles, detailed applications, and minute particulars. All these principles, details, particulars and the exposition of every precept constitute the Oral Law, which each court received from its predecessor. There are other precepts which originated after the Sinaitic Revelation, were instituted by prophets and sages and were universally accepted by all Israel. Such are the reading of the Scroll of Esther (on Purim), the kindling of the Chanucah lights, fasting on the Ninth of Ab, washing of the hands before meals and <italic>Erubin</italic> (ritual for relaxing the prohibition of carrying on Sabbath or walking outside a city beyond the prescribed limits on Sabbaths and festivals). Each of these precepts has its special interpretations and details, all of which will be expounded in this work.</p>
<p>All these newly established precepts, we are in duty bound to accept and observe, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not turn aside (from the sentence which they shall declare unto thee, to the right hand, nor to the left)&#x201D; (Deut. 17:11). They are not an addition to the precepts of the Torah. In regard to what, then, did the Torah warn us, &#x201C;Thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish (from it)&#x201D; (Deut. 13:1)? The purpose of this text is to teach us that a prophet is not permitted to make an innovation and declare that the Holy One, blessed be He, had commanded him to add it to the precepts of the Torah or had bidden him to abrogate one of these six hundred and thirteen precepts. But if the Court, together with the prophet living at the time, institute an additional precept as an ordinance, judicial decision or decree, this is not an addition (to the precepts of the Torah). For they did not assert that the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded the making of an <italic>Erub,</italic> or ordered the reading of the Scroll of Esther at the appointed time. Had they said this, they would have been adding to the Torah. We hold, however, that the prophets, in conjunction with the Court, enacted these ordinances, and commanded that the Scroll of Esther be read at the appointed time, so as to proclaim the praises of the Holy One, blessed be He, recount the salvations that He wrought for us, and that He was ever nigh when we cried to Him, and that we should therefore bless and laud Him and inform future generations how true is the reassurance of the Torah in the text, &#x201C;For what great nation is there that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord, our God is (to us), whensoever we call upon Him&#x201D; (Deut. 4:7). In this way every precept, affirmative or negative, instituted by the Scribes, is to be understood.</p>
<p>I have seen fit to divide this work into fourteen books.</p>
<ftnote id="fn16">&#x002A; Prohibition 15 refers to seduction of inhabitants of a city or tribe in Israel to idolatry; prohibition 16, to enticement of individual Israelites.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn17">&#x002A;&#x002A; <span dir="rtl">&#x05F3;&#x05EA;&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05D4;</span> taken in the sense of &#x201C;to desire&#x201D;; &#x201C;to have an affection for&#x201D;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn18">&#x002A; <italic>Or</italic> &#x201C;Not to practice soothsaying&#x201D;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn19">&#x002A; But only when he is to perform service there.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn20">&#x002A;&#x002A; The permission to serve after sunset can be inferred from Lev. 22:7: &#x201C;And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall afterwards eat of the holy things, because it is his food.&#x201D; The prohibition is implied in Lev. 21:6, as above.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn21">&#x002A; This is a euphemism for sodomy. See Deut. 23:18; (Authorized English Version, 23:17).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn22">&#x002A; By extensive interpretation, the rule is applied to all cattle set apart for any sacrifices.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn23">&#x002A;&#x002A; A non-Israelite who lives in the land of Israel, and keeps the seven Noachide precepts.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn24">&#x002A; Explained as meaning, &#x201C;intended to be eaten on the third day&#x201D;. See Maimonides&#x2019; &#x2018;Book of Precepts&#x2019; (Prohibition 132).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn25">&#x002A;&#x002A; The law applies also to a priest&#x2019;s daughter who has profaned herself by illicit intercourse.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn26">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; Such as peace-offerings, consumed by the owners, with the exception of what is burnt on the alter and the priests&#x2019; portions.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn27">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; Such as sin-offerings, trespass-offerings.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn28">&#x002A; An offering is vowed, when a particular beast has been set apart for sacrifice. A free-will offering is so called when one promised to bring a special kind of sacrifice without setting apart a particular beast.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn29">&#x002A; So Maimonides explains it in his <italic>Sefer-ha-Mitzvoth,</italic> Prohibition 163.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn30">&#x002A; Maimonides, in the <italic>Sefer-Ha-Mitzvoth,</italic> says, on the authority of the <italic>Sifra,</italic> that prohibition 176 refers to vermin that procreate their kind, while prohibition 177 refers to those that do not do so.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn31">&#x002A;&#x002A; When the <italic>Omer</italic> meal-offering was offered up with its prescribed sacrifice.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn32">&#x002A; The M S. has here incorrectly <span dir="rtl">&#x05D5;&#x05D4;&#x05D0;&#x05D1;&#x05D3;&#x05EA;&#x05D9;</span> &#x201C;and I shall destroy&#x201D; which is in the next verse and refers to the violation of the prohibition of work on the Day of Atonement.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn33">&#x002A;&#x002A; The previous verse (Deut. 16:2) reads &#x201C;Thou shalt sacrifice the Paschal offering unto the Lord, thy God&#x201D;. No leaven must be eaten by the Israelite when the Paschal sacrifice is offered up (Maimonides&#x2019; <italic>Sefer-Ha-Mitzvoth</italic> on this precept).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn34">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; <span dir="rtl">&#x05D7;&#x05E8;&#x05E6;&#x05E0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> and <span dir="rtl">&#x05D6;&#x05D2;</span> are respectively so rendered in the <italic>Targum Onkelos, Rashi</italic> and the <italic>Biur.</italic> The Philadelphia version translates the former term as &#x201C;pressed grapes&#x201D;, and the latter as &#x201C;grape-stones&#x201D;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn35">&#x002A; That is, to change the suburbs into town lots, or <italic>vice versa,</italic> or the fields into either of the two former classes of land. (T.B. Sotah 57b and Maimonides&#x2019; <italic>Sefer-Ha-Mitzvoth</italic> on Prohibition 228).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn36">&#x002A;&#x002A; Here, <span dir="rtl">&#x05EA;&#x05E9;&#x05D9;&#x05DA;</span>, a causative <italic>Hiphil</italic> form, is used and literally means that the borrower shall not cause the lender to bite him by usury.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn37">&#x002A; Maimonides, in his <italic>Sefer-Ha-Mitzvoth</italic> (Prohibition 251), explains it as annoying one by sneers or reproaches.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn38">&#x002A;&#x002A; According to <italic>Sifr&#x00E9;</italic>, quoted by Maimonides in the <italic>Sefer-Ha-Mitzvoth, &#x201C;make menial use of her&#x201D;.</italic></ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn39">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; To covet is to plan &#x201C;taking away what belongs to another&#x201D;; to lust, is &#x201C;to long for it&#x201D;.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn40">&#x002A; Maimonides, in <italic>Sefer-Ha-Mitzvoth,</italic> (Prohibition 271), explains this to mean a prohibition of measuring land by estimation or otherwise than with absolute accuracy.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn41">&#x002A;&#x002A; Diverse measures and weights pretending that they are the same denomination.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn42">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; This means that this evidence it not to be received by the Court.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn43">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; The Hebrew word <span dir="rtl">&#x05D9;&#x05E2;&#x05E0;&#x05D4;,</span> is taken in the sense of &#x201C;declare&#x201D;. Deut. 19:15 prohibits a decision on the evidence of one witness (Prohibition 288).</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn44">&#x002A; In Maimonides&#x2019; <italic>Sefer-Ha-Mitzvoth,</italic> the order of Prohibitions 295 and 296 is reversed.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn45">&#x002A;&#x002A; In Maimonides&#x2019; <italic>Sefer-Ha-Mitzvoth,</italic> this prohibits misleading anyone.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn46">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; Explained in the Sifra, on this verse, as meaning that, in rebuking, we must not put the rebuked person to shame.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn47">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; Elohim taken in the sense of &#x201C;judges&#x201D;. So too, in Ps. 82:1b.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn48">&#x002A; 2,000 cubits beyond the limits of a town.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn49">&#x002A;&#x002A; Capital punishment by burning could not be inflicted on the Sabbath, and therefore no punishments are inflicted on that day.</ftnote>
<ftnote id="fn50">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A; As being unnecessary to set forth.</ftnote>

<chapter>
    <title>Laws of Foundations of the Torah</title>
    <p>Continue thy loving kindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness unto the upright in heart (Ps. 36:11).</p>
    <p><xref rid="fn91">&#x002A;</xref> (treats of five categories of laws in the following order : laws appertaining to the fundamental principles of the Torah; laws relating to ethics; laws concerning the study of the Torah; laws referring to idolatry, and the ordinances of idolaters; laws concerning repentance.) <xref rid="fn91">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>LAWS CONCERNING THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF THE TORAH. These cover ten precepts, six of which are affirmative, while four are negative. First, to know that there is a God. Second, not to permit the thought to enter the mind that there is any God but the Eternal Third, to acknowledge His Unity. Fourth, to love Him. Fifth, to revere Him. Sixth, to sanctify His Name. Seventh, not to profane His name. Eighty, not to destroy things which bear His name. Ninth, to listen to (and accept) the prophet who speaks in His Name. Tenth, not to tempt Him. The exposition of all these precepts forms the contents of the following chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>1. The basic principle of all basic principles and the pillar of all sciences is to realise that there is a First Being who brought every existing thing into being. All existing things, whether celestial, terrestrial, or belonging to an intermediate class, exist only through His true Existence.</p>
<p>2. If it could be supposed that He did not exist, it would follow that nothing else could possibly exist.</p>
<p>3. If, however, it were supposed that all other beings were non-existent, He alone would still exist. Their non-existence would not involve His non-existence. For all beings are in need of Him; but He, blessed be He, is not in need of them nor of any of them.</p>
<p>I.<xref rid="fn92">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> Hence, His real essence is unlike that of any of them.</p>
<p>4. This is what the prophet means when he says &#x201C;But the Eternal is the true God&#x201D; (Jer. 10:10); that is, He alone real, and nothing else has reality like His reality. The same thought the Torah expresses in the text: &#x201C;There is none else besides Him&#x201D; (Deut. 4:35) ; that is : There is no being besides Him, that is really like Him.</p>
<p>II.<xref rid="fn92">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> 5. This being is the God of the Universe, the Lord of all the Earth. And He it is, who controls the Sphere (of the Universe) with a power that is without end or limit; with a power that is never intermitted. For the Sphere is always revolving; and it is impossible for it to revolve without someone making it revolve. God, blessed be He, it is, who, without hand or body, causes it to revolve.</p>
<p>6. To acknowledge this truth is an affirmative precept, as it is said &#x201C;I am the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Ex. 20:2; Deut. 5:6). And whoever permits the thought to enter his mind that there is another deity besides this God, violates a prohibition ; as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt have no other gods before me&#x201D; (Ex. 20:3; Deut. 5:7), and denies the essence of Religion&#x2014;this doctrine being the great principle on which everything depends.</p>
<p>III. 7. This God is One. He is not two nor more than two, but One; so that none of the things existing in the universe to which the term one is applied is like unto His Unity; neither such a unit as a species which comprises many units (e.g. sub-species), nor such a unit as a physical body which consists of parts and dimensions. His Unity is such that there is no other Unity like it in the world.</p>
<p>IV. If there were plural deities, these would be physical bodies; because entities, that can be enumerated and are equal in their essence, are only distinguishable from each other by the accidents<xref rid="fn93">&#x002A;</xref> that happen to physical bodies. If the Creator were a physical body, He would have bounds and limits, for it is impossible for a physical body to be without limits; and where a body is limited and finite, its energy is also limited and finite. And our God, blessed be his Name, since His power is infinite and unceasing&#x2014;for the Sphere (of the Universe) is continually revolving&#x2014;His power is not the energy of a physical body. And since He is not a physical body, the accidents that happen to physical bodies do not apply to Him, so as to distinguish Him from another being. Hence, it is impossible that He can be anything but One. To realize this truth is an affirmative precept, as it is said &#x201C;The Eternal, our God, is One God&#x201D; (Deut. 6:4).</p>
<p>V. 8. That the Holy One, blessed be He, is not a physical body, is explicitly set forth in the Pentateuch and in the Prophets, as it is said &#x201C;(Know therefore) that the Lord, He is God in Heaven above, and upon the Earth beneath&#x201D; (Deut. 4:39); and a physical body is not in two places at one time. Furthermore, it is said, &#x201C;For Ye saw no manner of similitude&#x201D; (Deut. 4:15); and again it is said, &#x201C;To whom then will Ye liken me, or shall I be equal ?&#x201D; (Is. 40:25). If He were a body, He would be like other bodies.</p>
<p>VI. 9. Since this is so, what is the meaning of the following expressions found in the Torah: &#x201C;Beneath his feet&#x201D; (Ex. 24:10); &#x201C;Written with the finger of God&#x201D; (Ex. 31:18); &#x201C;The hand of God&#x201D; (Ex. 9:3); &#x201C;The eyes of God&#x201D; (Gen. 38:7); &#x201C;The ears of God&#x201D; (Num. 11:1); and similar phrases ? All these expressions are adapted to the mental capacity of the majority of mankind who have a clear perception of physical bodies only. The Torah speaks in the language of men. All these phrases are metaphorical like the sentence &#x201C;If I whet my glittering sword&#x201D; (Deut. 32:41). Has God then a sword and does he slay with a sword? The term is used allegorically and all these phrases are to be understood in a similar sense. That this view is correct is proved by the fact that one prophet says that he had a vision of the Holy One, blessed be He, &#x201C;Whose garment was white as snow&#x201D; (Dan. 7:9),while another says that he saw Him &#x201C;with dyed garments from Bozrah&#x201D; (Is. 63:1) Moses, our teacher, himself saw Him at the Red Sea as a mighty man waging war (Ex. 15:3) and on Sinai, as a Congregational Reader wrapped (in his Talith)&#x2014;all indicating that in reality He has no form or figure. These only appeared in a prophetic vision. But God&#x2019;s essence as it really is, the human mind does not understand and is incapable of grasping or investigating. And this is expressed in the scriptural text &#x201C;Canst thou, by searching, find out God? Canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? (Job 11:7).</p>
<p>10. What was it that Moses sought to comprehend, when he said &#x201C;Show me, I beseech thee, Thy glory?&#x201D; (Ex. 33:18). He sought to have so clear an apprehension of the truth of God&#x2019;s existence that the knowledge might be like that which one possesses of a human being, whose face one has seen and whose image is imprinted on the mind and whom, therefore, the mind distinguishes from other men. In the same way, Moses, our teacher, asked that the truth of God&#x2019;s existence might be distinguished in his mind from other beings, and that he might thus know the truth of God&#x2019;s existence, as it really is. God replied that it is beyond the mental capacity of a human creature, composed of body and soul, to obtain in this regard clear knowledge of the truth. The Almighty, however, imparted to Moses, what has been vouchsafed to no man before or since. Moses attained so much knowledge of the truth of the Divine Existence, that God was, in his mind, distinct from other beings, in the same way as an individual, whose back is seen, whose physical form and apparel are perceived, is distinguished in the observer&#x2019;s mind from the physical form of other individuals. And Scripture hints this in the text &#x201C;Thou shalt see My rearward but my face shall not be seen&#x201D; (Ex. 33:23).</p>
<p>11. Since it has been demonstrated that He is not a body, it is clear that none of the accidents of matter can be attributed to Him; neither conjunction nor separation, neither location nor dimension, neither ascent nor descent, neither right nor left, neither front nor rear, neither a sitting nor a standing posture. Nor does He exist in time, in the sense that He has either a beginning, end or definite number of years. Nor does He change, for there is nought in Him that would effect a change in Him. He does not die, nor has He life like that of an animal body. Folly is not an attribute of His Being, nor wisdom, like that of a wise man ; neither passion nor frivolity; neither joy nor melancholy; neither silence nor speech like that of human beings. And so the sages have said, &#x201C;Above, there is neither sitting nor standing, neither rigidity nor relaxation.&#x201D;</p>
<p>12. This being so, the expressions in the Pentateuch and books of the Prophets already mentioned, and others similar to these, are all of them metaphorical and rhetorical, as for example, &#x201C;He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh&#x201D; (Ps. 2:4), &#x201C;They have provoked me to anger with their vanities&#x201D; (Deut. 32:21), &#x201C;As the Lord rejoiced&#x201D; (Deut. 28:63), etc. To all these phrases, applies the saying &#x201C;The Torah speaks in the language of men.&#x201D; So too, it is said &#x201C;Do they provoke Me to anger?&#x201D; (Jer. 7:19); and yet it is said &#x201C;I am the Lord, I change not&#x201D; (Malachi 3:6). If God was sometimes angry and sometimes rejoiced, He would be changing. All these states exist in physical beings that are of obscure and mean condition, dwelling in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust. Infinitely blessed and exalted above all this, is God, blessed be He.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>This God, honoured and revered, it is our duty to love and fear ; as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 6:5), and it is further said &#x201C;Thou shalt fear the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 6:13).</p>
<p>2. And what is the way that will lead to the love of Him and the fear of Him ? When a person contemplates His great and wondrous works and creatures and from them obtains a glimpse of His wisdom which is incomparable and infinite, he will straightway love Him, praise Him, glorify Him, and long with an exceeding longing to know His great Name ; even as David said &#x201C;My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God&#x201D; (Ps. 42:3). And when he ponders these matters, he will recoil affrighted, and realize that he is a small creature, lowly and obscure, endowed with slight and slender intelligence, standing in the presence of Him who is perfect in knowledge. And so David said &#x201C;When I consider Thy heavens, the work of Thy fingers&#x2014;&#x2014;what is man that Thou art mindful of Him?&#x201D; (Ps. 8:4-5). In harmony with these sentiments, I shall explain some large, general aspects of the Works of the Sovereign of the Universe, that they may serve the intelligent individual as a door to the love of God, even as our sages have remarked in connection with the theme of the love of God, &#x201C;Observe the Universe and hence, you will realize Him who spake and the world was.&#x201D;</p>
<p>3. All that the Holy God, blessed be He, created in His universe falls into three divisions. Some are creatures consisting of substance and form, continuously coming into being and decaying. Such are bodies of human creatures and other animals, plants and minerals. Others are creatures consisting of substance and form which do not however like those of the first category, change, from one body to another or from one form to another, but retain their form permanently in their substance, not varying like the members of the former class. Such are the heavenly spheres and the stars placed in them. Their substance is not like other substances nor are their forms like other forms. Others again are creatures that consist of form without substance. These are the angels. For the angels are not material bodies, but only forms distinguished from each other.</p>
<p>4. What then is meant when the prophets say that they saw an angel of fire, possessing wings? Such descriptions are to be understood as prophetic visions and are to be taken in an allegorical sense. They are meant to indicate that the angel is not corporeal and has no gravity like bodies which have weight. Thus too, it is said &#x201C;For the Lord, thy God, is a devouring fire&#x201D; (Deut. 4:24). Yet God is not fire. The expression is a metaphor. Similarly it is said &#x201C;He makes his angels winds&#x201D; (Ps. 104:4).</p>
<p>5. In what way are these forms different from each other, seeing that they are incorporeal ? The answer is that, in their essential being, they are not equal. Each of them is below another and exists by the other&#x2019;s energy, and so, throughout, one angel being above the other. And all exist by the power and goodness of the Holy God, blessed be He. Solomon, in his wisdom, alludes to this in the text &#x201C;For higher than the high, One watcheth&#x201D; (Eccles. 5:7).</p>
<p>6. When we say that one angel is below another, this does not refer to position in space as when we think of an individual who occupies a higher seat than another, but to superiority in rank, as when one says in reference to two scholars, one of whom has more wisdom than the other, that he is the higher in degree, or when one says of the cause that it is higher than the effect.</p>
<p>7. The variety of names that the angels bear has reference to the difference in their rank. They are called <italic>Hayoth Hakodesh</italic>&#x2014;these are the highest; <italic>Ophanim, Erelim, Hashmalim, Seraphim. Malachim</italic>: <italic>Elohim, Bene Elohim, Cherubim</italic> and <italic>Ishim.</italic> These ten names, by which the angels are called, correspond to their ten degrees. The highest rank, above which there is no degree higher but that of God, blessed be He, is that of the form called <italic>Hayoth.</italic> In the prophetic literature it is therefore said that the <italic>Hayoth</italic> are beneath the Throne of Glory. To the tenth degree, belongs the form of those termed <italic>Ishim.</italic> They are the angels that commune with the prophets and appear to them in the prophetic vision. They are called <italic>Ishim</italic> (individuals, men), because their rank approximates to that of the intelligence of human beings.</p>
<p>8. All these forms live, realize the Creator, and possess a knowledge of Him that is exceedingly great&#x2014;a knowledge corresponding with the rank of each but having no relation to the infinite greatness of the Creator. Even the highest class of angels, cannot attain to a knowledge of the truth concerning God as He really is. For this, their capacities are insufficient. But the highest angelic form apprehends and knows more than the one below it; and so on, through all the degrees down to the tenth. This, too, knows God with a knowledge, to the like of which, human beings, consisting of matter as well as form, cannot attain. But hone of them knows the Creator as He knows himself.</p>
<p>9. All beings, except the Creator, from the highest angelic form to the tiniest insect that is in the interior of the earth, exist by the power of God&#x2019;s essential existence. And as He has self-knowledge, and realizes His greatness, glory and truth, He knows all, and nought is hidden from Him.</p>
<p>10. The Holy One, blessed be He, realizes His true being, and knows it as it is, not with a knowledge external to himself, as is our knowledge. For our knowledge and ourselves are separate. But as for the Creator, blessed be He, His knowledge and His life are One, in all aspects, from every point of view, and however we conceive Unity. If the Creator lived as other living creatures live, and His knowledge were external to Himself, there would be a plurality of deities, namely; He himself, His life, and His knowledge. This however, is not so. He is One in every aspect, from every angle, and in all ways in which Unity is conceived. Hence the conclusion that God is the One who knows, is known, and is the knowledge (of Himself)&#x2014;all these being One. This is beyond the power of speech to express, beyond the capacity of the ear to hear, and of the human mind to apprehend clearly. Scripture, accordingly says &#x201C;By the life of Pharaoh&#x201D; and &#x201C;By the life of thy soul&#x201D; but not &#x201C;By the life of the Eternal&#x201D;. The phrase employed is &#x201C;As God liveth&#x201D;; because the Creator and His life are not dual, as is the case with the life of living bodies or of angels. Hence too, God does not apprehend creatures and know them because of them, as we know them, but He knows them because of Himself. Knowing Himself, He knows everything, for everything is attached to Him, in His Being.</p>
<p>11. What has been said on this topic in these two chapters is but a drop in the ocean, compared with what has to be elucidated on this subject. The exposition of all the principles alluded to in these two chapters forms the so-called <italic>Maaseh Mercabah</italic> &#x2014; &#x201C;Account of the Divine Chariot&#x201D; (Ezekiel Chap. 1).</p>
<p>12. The ancient sages enjoined us only to discuss these subjects privately, with one individual, and then only if he be wise and capable of independent reasoning. In this case, the heads of the topics are communicated to him, and he is instructed in a minute portion of the subject. It is left to him to develop the conclusions for himself and to penetrate to the depths of the subject. These topics are exceedingly profound; and not every intellect is able to grasp them. Solomon, in his wisdom, said, in regard to them, by way of parable: &#x201C;The lambs<xref rid="fn94">&#x002A;</xref> will be for thy clothing&#x201D; (Prov. 27:26). Thus have the sages said, in the exposition of this parable, &#x201C;matters that deal with the mystery of the universe shall be for thy garment, that is, for thee alone; do not expound them in public&#x201D;. So too, Solomon said concerning these topics &#x201C;Let them be for thee alone and not for strangers with thee&#x201D; (Prov. 5:17).</p>
<p>And he further said concerning these subjects &#x201C;Honey and milk are under thy tongue&#x201D; (Solomon&#x2019;s song 4:11). This text the ancient sages have thus explained, &#x201C;The things that are like milk and honey shall be under thy tongue&#x201D;.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>I. The spheres are entitled: Heaven, Firmament, Habitation and Celestial Clouds (Araboth). There are nine spheres. The one nearest to us is the Lunar sphere. The second above it is the sphere which contains the star called Mercury. Above this, is the third sphere, in which Venus moves. The fourth sphere is that to which the Sun belongs. The fifth, that of Mars; the sixth, that of Jupiter. The seventh, that of Saturn; the eighth, that in which move all the other stars that are visible in the sky; the ninth is the sphere which revolves daily from East to West.</p>
<p>II. It includes and encircles all things. That the stars seem all to be in the same sphere, though in reality they are at different altitudes, is due to the fact that the spheres are clear and transparent like glass or sapphire. Hence, the stars in the eighth sphere appear to be beneath the first sphere.</p>
<p>III. 2. Everyone of the eight spheres in which the stars move is divisible into numerous spheres, one above the other, like the several layers of onions. Some spheres revolve from west to east; others from east to west, as for instance, the ninth sphere, which moves from east to west. And between the spheres, no vacuum intervenes.</p>
<p>IV. 3. All of these spheres are neither light nor heavy. None of them is red, black or of any other colour. That they appear blue is an optical phenomenon, due to the height of the atmosphere. The spheres are tasteless and inodorous, these properties being found only in bodies that exist below them.</p>
<p>V. 4. All these spheres that encompass the world, are round like a globe, and the Earth is suspended in the centre. Some of the stars have small spheres in which they are fixed, and which do not revolve round the earth. But the small sphere which does not revolve round the earth is itself fixed in a large sphere which does revolve.</p>
<p>VI. 5. The number of all the spheres that revolve round the world is eighteen. The number of the small spheres that do not so revolve is eight. And from the courses of the stars, from their known daily and hourly rate of movement, from their declination from the south towards the north and from the north towards the south, from their height above the earth and their approximation to it, the number of these spheres can be ascertained, as well as the lines of their movement and the courses they traverse. This forms the Science of Mathematical Astronomy, on which the Greek sages composed many treatises.</p>
<p>VII. 6. The Ninth sphere which encompasses the universe was divided by the ancient sages into twelve parts. To each of these, they assigned a name according to the form which the stars exactly below that part seemed to assume. These are the Constellations that are respectively called Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces.</p>
<p>VIII. 7. The Ninth Sphere itself has no division; none of these shapes, nor any star. It is only in grouping the stars in the eighth sphere, that they assume such forms or approximately so. These twelve forms were situated directly opposite these divisions only at the period of the Flood, when those names were given them. At present, they have somewhat shifted. For the stars in the Eighth Sphere all move like the Sun and Moon; but move slowly, so that a distance traversed by the Sun or Moon in a day takes one of these stars approximately seventy years to cover.</p>
<p>IX. 8. Of the visible stars, some are so small that the Earth is larger than any one of them; while others are so large that each of them is several times the size of the Earth. The magnitude of the Earth is about forty times that of the Moon. The magnitude of the Sun, one hundred and seventy times that of the Earth. Hence, the Sun is approximately six thousand and eight hundred times the size of the Moon. No star is larger than the Sun; nor smaller than a star in the second sphere.</p>
<p>X. 9. Every star and sphere has a soul and is endowed with knowledge and intelligence. They are living beings who apprehend &#x2018;Him who spake and the world was&#x2019;. They praise and glorify their Creator, just as the angels do, each according to its greatness and degree. And as they apprehend God, so they are conscious of themselves and of the angels above them. The knowledge possessed by the stars and spheres, is less than that of angels, more than that of human beings.</p>
<p>XI. 10. Below the Sphere of the Moon, God created matter unlike that of the spheres. And for this matter, He created four forms which are unlike the form of the Spheres. Each of these forms was set in a different portion of this matter. The first of these forms&#x2014;that of Fire&#x2014;was combined with a part of the sublunary matter and the result was the actual body of fire. The second form&#x2014;that of Air&#x2014;was united with another portion and the result was the actual body of air. The third form&#x2014;that of Water&#x2014;was joined to another portion and the result was the actual body of water. The fourth form&#x2014;that of Earth&#x2014;was combined with another portion and the result was the actual body of earth. Thus beneath the firmament, there are four distinct bodies, one above the other; the higher completely surrounding those below it on all sides, like a sphere. The first, nearest the sphere of the Moon, is the body of Fire: beneath it, the body of Air; below this, the body of Water; below this again, the body of Earth. Between these bodies, there is no vacuum.</p>
<p>XII. 11. These four bodies are without souls. They have neither knowledge nor perception, and are thus like dead bodies. Each of them has a governing principle of which it has no knowledge nor apprehension, and which it cannot alter. And this is expressed by David in the text &#x201C;Praise the Lord from the Earth, ye sea-monsters and all depths; fire and hail, snow and vapours&#x201D; (Ps. 148:7-8). The meaning of the passage is: Praise Him, ye children of men, because of the manifestations of His might, which you see in fire, hail and the other created things beneath the sky; the power of which, old and young constantly perceive.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. These four bodies, namely: fire, air, earth and water, are the basic elements of all created things that are beneath the firmament. All things&#x2014;man and beast, bird, reptile, fish, plant, minerals, precious stones and pearls, stones for building, mountains and clods of earth are, as far as their matter is concerned, composed of these four elements. And accordingly, apart from the four elements, all bodies beneath the firmament are composed of a substance and form&#x2014;this substance consisting of a combination of the four elements. Each of these four elements, however, consists of form and matter only.</p>
<p>2. The nature of fire and air is to ascend from below; that is, from the centre of the earth, upward towards the sky. The nature of water and earth is to move from beneath the sky downward, towards the centre, for the centre of the firmament is the lowest point beyond which there is no lower. Their movement is not conscious nor voluntary. It is a governing principle fixed in them and a nature impressed upon them. The nature of fire is hot and dry; this element is the lightest of all. Air is hot and moist; water, cold and moist; earth, dry and cold. This last is the heaviest of all the elements. Water is lighter than earth and is therefore found above the surface of the Earth. Air is lighter than water; hence, it blows above the water. Fire is lighter than air. And since these are the basic elements of all bodies that exist beneath the firmament, the substance of every such body, whether of man, beast&#x2014;domestic and wild&#x2014;bird, fish, plant, mineral, or stone, is made up of fire, air, water and earth. These four elements mingle and become changed at the time of their combination, so that the resulting compound bears no resemblance to any of them. In the compound, there is not a single particle that is fire alone, or water alone, or earth alone or air alone. All these elements have been transformed and fused into one body. Every such body possesses in itself, at one and the same time, the properties of cold and heat, moisture and dryness. But there are some in which the predominating element is fire, such as, for example, animals; in these, therefore, the quality of heat is particularly noticeable. In other bodies as, for instance, stones, earth is the predominant element. Hence, their marked feature is dryness. In other bodies again, water is the prevailing element; and their characteristic is humidity. Thus too, one body will be hotter than another which also has some heat; or drier than another which is also dry. So too, in some bodies, cold is marked; in others, moisture alone will be noticeable. In others again, cold and moisture, or cold and dryness, will be perceptible, in equal degree and at the same time; similarly with heat and dryness, or heat and humidity. In accordance with the proportion of an element in a compound, will its force and nature manifest itself in that compound.</p>
<p>3. Everything made up of these four elements, ultimately disintegrates. This process takes place in the case of some things after a few days; in the case of others, after several years. But everything compounded of them must inevitably revert to them. Even gold and the carnelian cannot but disintegrate and return to their original elements; part becoming fire; part, water; part, air; and part, earth.</p>
<p>4. Since everything that disintegrates dissolves into these elements, why was the first man especially told &#x201C;And unto <italic>dust</italic> shalt thou return&#x201D; (Gen. 3:19)? The reason is because the human structure consists, for the greater part, of dust. Everything, capable of decay, does not, during this process, immediately revert to its four elements. It frequently disintegrates and becomes another thing which, in its turn, changes into something else. At the end of these changes, it resolves into its elements. And so all things continually recur.</p>
<p>5. These four elements are ceaselessly, daily and hourly, changing into each other; but only partially, not completely. How so ? That part of earth which is nearest in its nature to water, alters, crumbles and becomes water; that part of water which is nearest in nature to air, becomes attenuated and turns into air; that portion of air most akin to fire, is transformed into fire. And so too, a reverse process takes place. That part of fire, which is nearest in nature to air, condenses and changes into air. That portion of air most akin to water, condenses and turns into water. That part of water most akin to earth, solidifies and becomes earth. These transmutations take place slowly, gradually and in the course of a long period. Nor does the whole of the element change to the extent that all the water in a body turns into air; or all the air into fire; for it is impossible that an element should altogether disappear; but part only turns from fire into air or <italic>vice versa,</italic> and such mutual changes take place in all the four elements in a perpetual cycle.</p>
<p>6. The changes arise from the movement of the Sphere. This causes the four elements to combine and produce other substances&#x2014;those of human beings and other animals, vegetables, stones and minerals. To each of these substances God gives its suitable form through the angels of the tenth degree, called &#x201C;<italic>Ishim</italic>&#x201D;, &#x201C;Individuals&#x201D;.</p>
<p>7. You can never see matter without form, or form without matter. But the human mind divides in thought an existing body into its constituents and recognises that it is made up of matter and form. It also knows that in some objects, the matter is composed of the four elements; while in others, it is simple, consisting of one substance. The forms that are devoid of matter cannot be perceived with the physical eye but only with the mind&#x2019;s eye; in the same way as we are conscious of the Lord of the Universe, without physical vision.</p>
<p>8. The vital principle of all flesh is the form which God has given it. The superior intelligence in the human soul is the specific form of the mentally normal human being. To this form, the Torah refers in the text &#x201C;Let us make man in our image, after our likeness&#x201D; (Gen. 1:26). This means that man should have a form that knows and apprehends idealistic beings that are devoid of matter, such as the angels which are forms without substance, so that (intellectually) man is like the angels. The text, above quoted, does not refer to the visible features&#x2014;the mouth, nose, cheeks, and other distinguishing bodily marks. These are comprehended in the nomenclature &#x201C;feature&#x201D;. Nor does it refer to the vital principle in every animal by which it eats, drinks, reproduces, feels and broods. It is the intellect which is the human soul&#x2019;s specific form. And to this specific form of the soul, the Scriptural phrase &#x201C;in our image, after our likeness&#x201D; alludes. This form is frequently called &#x201C;<italic>Nephesh&#x201D;, &#x201C;Ruach&#x201D;</italic> (soul, spirit). One must therefore, in order to avoid mistakes, pay special attention to the meaning of these terms which, in each case, has to be ascertained from the context.</p>
<p>9. This form of the Soul is not compounded of elements into which it would again dissolve. Nor does it exist by the energy of the vital<xref rid="fn95">&#x002A;</xref> principle so that the latter would be necessary to its existence, in the way that the vital<xref rid="fn95">&#x002A;</xref> principle requires a physical body, for its existence. But it comes directly from God in Heaven. Hence, when the material portion of our being dissolves into its component elements, and physical life perishes&#x2014;since that only exists in association with the body and needs the body for its functions, this form of the Soul, is not destroyed, as it does not require physical life for its activities. It knows and apprehends the Intelligences that exist without material substance; it knows the Creator of All things; and it endures for ever. Solomon, in his wisdom, said, &#x201C;And the dust returneth to the earth as it was, and the spirit returneth to God who gave it&#x201D; (Eccles. 12:7).</p>
<p>10. The matters just discussed are like a drop in a bucket, and are very deep, but are not as deep as those treated in the First and Second Chapters. The exposition of the topics dealt with in the Third and Fourth Chapters, is termed <italic>Maaseh Bereshith</italic> (cosmogony). Our ancient sages enjoined us that these matters are not to be expounded in public, but should be communicated and taught to an individual privately.</p>
<p>11. What distinction is there between the <italic>Maaseh Mercabah</italic> (Ezek. I) and the <italic>Maaseh Bereshith ?</italic> The subject matter of <italic>Maaseh Mercabah</italic> is not expounded even to an individual unless he is wise and able to draw conclusions independently; and then, only the heads of the subjects are communicated to him. But the topics of the <italic>Maaseh Bereshith</italic> are taught to an individual; and even if he is unable to form independent conclusions we nevertheless teach him as much as he is capable of learning on these matters. Why is the subject not taught in public ? Because not every one possesses the breadth of intellect requisite for obtaining an accurate grasp of the meaning and interpretation of all its contents.</p>
<p>12. When a man reflects on these things, studies all these created beings, from the angels and spheres down to human beings and so on, and realises the Divine Wisdom manifested in them all, his love for God will increase, his soul will thirst, his very flesh will yearn, to love God. He will be filled with fear and trembling, as he becomes conscious of his own lowly condition, poverty and insignificance, and compares himself with any of the great and holy bodies; still more when he compares himself with any one of the pure forms that are incorporeal and have never had association with corporeal substance. He will then realise that he is a vessel full of shame, dishonour and reproach, empty and deficient.</p>
<p>13. The topics connected with these five precepts, treated in the above four chapters, are what our wise men called <italic>Pardes,</italic> (Paradise), as in the passage &#x201C;Four went into <italic>Pardes&#x201D;</italic> (T.B. Chagiga 14). And although those four were great men of Israel and great sages, they did not all possess the capacity to know and grasp these subjects clearly. Therefore, I say that it is not proper to dally in <italic>Pardes</italic> till one has first filled oneself with bread and meat; by which I mean knowledge of what is permitted and what forbidden, and similar distinctions in other classes of precepts. Although these last subjects were called by the sages &#x201C;a small thing&#x201D; (when they say &#x201C;A great thing, <italic>Maaseh Mercabah;</italic> a small thing, the discussion of Abaye and Rava&#x201D;), still they should have the precedence. For the knowledge of these things gives primarily composure to the mind. They are the precious boon bestowed by God, to promote social well-being on earth, and enable men to obtain bliss in the life hereafter. Moreover, the knowledge of them is within the reach of all, young and old, men and women; those gifted with great intellectual capacity as well as those whose intelligence is limited.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>
<p>1. All the members of the house of Israel are commanded to sanctify the great Name of God, as it is said &#x201C;But I will be hallowed among the children of Israel&#x201D; (Lev. 22:32). They are furthermore cautioned not to profane it, as it is said &#x201C;Neither shall ye profane My holy Name&#x201D; (Lev. 22:32). How are these precepts to be applied? Should an idolater arise and coerce an Israelite to violate any one of the commandments mentioned in the Torah under the threat that otherwise he would put him to death, the Israelite is to commit the transgression rather than suffer death; for concerning the commandments it is said &#x201C;which, if a man do them, he shall live by them&#x201D; (Lev. 18:5): &#x201C;<italic>Live</italic> by them, and not die by them&#x201D;. And if he suffered death rather than commit a transgression, he himself is to blame for his death.</p>
<p>2. This rule applies to all the commandments, except the prohibitions of idolatry, inchastity and murder. With regard to these: if an Israelite should be told &#x201C;transgress one of them or else you will be put to death&#x201D;, he should suffer death rather than transgress. The above distinction only holds good if the idolater&#x2019;s motive is personal advantage; for example, if he forces an Israelite to build him a house or cook for him on the Sabbath, or forces a Jewess to cohabit with him, and so on; but if his purpose is to compel the Israelite to violate the ordinances of his religion, then if this took place privately and ten fellow-Israelites were not present, he should commit the transgression rather than suffer death. But if the attempt to coerce the Israelite to transgress was made in the presence of ten Israelites, he should suffer death and not transgress, even if it was only one of the remaining commandments that the idolater wished him to violate.</p>
<p>3. All the foregoing applies to a time free from religious persecution. But at a period when there is such persecution, such as when a wicked king arises like Nebuchednezzar and his confederates, and issues decrees against Israel, with the purpose of abolishing their religion or one of the precepts, then it is the Israelite&#x2019;s duty to suffer death and not violate any one, even of the remaining commandments, whether the coercion takes place in the presence of ten Israelites or in the presence of idolaters.</p>
<p>4. When one is enjoined to transgress rather than be slain, and suffers death rather than transgress he is to blame for his death. Where one is enjoined to die rather than transgress, and suffers death so as not to transgress, he sanctifies the name of God. If he does so in the presence of ten Israelites, he sanctifies the name of God publicly, like Daniel, Chananiah, Mishael and Azariah, Rabbi Akibah and his colleagues. These are the martyrs, than whom none ranks higher. Concerning them it is said, &#x201C;but for Thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter&#x201D; (Ps. 44:23). And to them also, the text refers, &#x201C;Gather my saints together unto Me, those that have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice&#x201D; (Ps. 50:5). Where one is enjoined to suffer death rather than transgress, and commits a transgression and so escapes death, he has profaned the name of God. If the transgression was committed in the presence of ten Israelites, he has profaned the name of God in public, failed to observe an affirmative precept&#x2014;to sanctify the name of God&#x2014;and violated a negative precept&#x2014;not to profane His Name. Still, as the transgression was committed under duress, he is not punished with stripes and, needless to add, he is not sentenced by a court to be put to death, even if, under duress, he committed murder. For the penalty of death or stripes is only inflicted on one who transgresses of his own free will, in the presence of witnesses and after due warning. This rule is based on the text concerning one who has given of his seed to Molech. &#x201C;And I will set my face against <italic>that</italic> man&#x201D; (Leviticus 20:3). The demonstrative &#x201C;<italic>that</italic>&#x201D; has been traditionally interpreted as exempting from punishment one who transgresses under compulsion, in ignorance or in error. Now, if in the case of idolatry which is the gravest of offences, the (divine) penalty of Excision and, needless, to add, the judicial penalty of death are not incurred by one who worships an idol under compulsion; then how much more is this the rule in regard to the violation of the other precepts of the Torah. So too, in connection with offences against chastity, it is expressly stated, &#x201C;But unto the damsel<xref rid="fn96">&#x002A;</xref> thou shalt do nothing&#x201D; (Deut. 22:26). However, if an individual is able to save himself and escape from the power of the wicked king and does not do so, he is like a dog that returns to its vomit. He is called a wilful idolater, is excluded from the world to come, and descends to the lowest depth of <italic>Gehinnom.</italic></p>
<p>5. If heathens said to a group of Jewish women &#x201C;Surrender one of your number to us, that we may defile her, or else we will defile you all,&#x201D; they should all suffer defilement rather than surrender to them a single person in Israel. So too, if heathens said to Israelites, &#x201C;Surrender one of your number to us, that we may put him to death, otherwise, we will put all of you to death&#x201D;, they should all suffer death rather than surrender a single Israelite to them. But if they specified an individual, saying &#x201C;Surrender that particular person to us, or else we will put all of you to death&#x201D;, they may give him up, provided that he was guilty of a capital crime like Sheba, son of Bichri (who rebelled against David). But this rule is not told them in advance. If the individual specified has not incurred capital punishment, they should all suffer death rather than surrender a single Israelite to them.</p>
<p>6. The principle of non-liability in case of duress also applies to sickness. If one is dangerously sick, and the physicians assert that he can be cured by the application of a remedy which involves violation of a precept of the Torah, the remedy should be applied. Where life is in danger, anything forbidden in the Torah may be used as a curative agent, except the practice of idolatry, unchastity or murder. Even to save life, these offences must not be committed. If a patient transgressed the prohibition and recovered, the Court sentences him to the punishment prescribed for the offence.</p>
<p>7. Whence is the rule derived, that even when life is in danger, none of these three offences may be committed ? From the text, &#x201C;And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God, with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy might,&#x201D; (Deut. 6:5). This means that love for God has to be manifested even at the cost of life. As to taking the life of an Israelite, to cure another individual or to rescue a person from one who threatens violence, reason indicates that one human life ought not to be destroyed to save another human life. Offences against chastity are analogous to the destruction of human life; for it is said &#x201C;For, as when a man riseth against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter.&#x201D; (Deut. 22:26).</p>
<p>8. The rule that forbidden things may only be employed as remedies where there is danger to life, applies only to their use in the ordinary way in which food is enjoyed, as for instance, if a patient is prescribed a diet of &#x201C;abominable and crawling creatures (Lev. 11:29, 41, 43), or of leavened bread during Passover, or of any food on the Day of Atonement. But where forbidden things are to be used not in the ordinary way in which they are enjoyed, as for example, to apply on Passover a plaster or poultice, made of leaven, or one made of fruit of the first three years&#x2019; produce of a tree at any time, or to drink a potion in which forbidden food is mingled with a bitter ingredient, so that the palate is not gratified&#x2014;in all these cases the use of forbidden food is permitted even where there is no danger to life. Exceptions to this rule are the produce of mixed seed in a vineyard, and a dish of meat and milk cooked together. These may not be used even in ways other than those in which food is ordinarily enjoyed. Hence, even when not consumed as food, these may not be used as remedies, except where there is danger to life.</p>
<p>9. If a man set his eyes on a woman, fell sick and was nigh to death, and the physicians said that there was no cure for him, unless she cohabit with him,&#x2014;let him die and let her not cohabit with him, even though she be unmarried. Nor is a decision given him that he may converse with her from behind a fence.<xref rid="fn97">&#x002A;</xref> Let him die rather, and let not such a decision be rendered, so that the daughters of Israel shall not be regarded as unprotected&#x2014;and thus the restraints of chastity would be loosened.</p>
<p>10. If one transgresses any of the commandments laid down in the Torah, of his own will and not under the stress of compulsion, but wantonly and in a spirit of provocation, he profanes the Name of God. And thus, in the text prohibiting false swearing, it is said, &#x201C;So thou wilt profane the name of thy God&#x201D;. (Lev. 19:12). One who commits a transgression in the presence of ten Israelites is guilty of the public profanation of God&#x2019;s Name. On the other hand, whoever abstains from a transgression or fulfils a precept, not from any personal motive, not induced thereto by fear and apprehension or by the desire for honour, but solely for the sake of the Creator, blessed be He, as Joseph did when he resisted his master&#x2019;s wife, sanctifies the Name of God.</p>
<p>11. There are other things that are a profanation of the Name of God. When a man, great in the knowledge of the Torah and reputed for his piety does things which cause people to talk about him, even if the acts are not express violations, he profanes the Name of God. As, for example, if such a person makes a purchase and does not pay promptly, provided that he has means and the creditors ask for payment and he puts them off; or if he indulges immoderately in jesting, eating or drinking, when he is staying with ignorant people or living among them; or if his mode of addressing people is not gentle, or he does not receive people affably, but is quarrelsome and irascible. The greater a man is the more scrupulous should he be in all such things, and do more than the strict letter of the law requires. And if a man has been scrupulous in his conduct, gentle in his conversation, pleasant towards his fellow-creatures, affable in manner when receiving them, not retorting, even when affronted, but showing courtesy to all, even to those who treat him with disdain, conducting his commercial affairs with integrity, not readily accepting the hospitality of the ignorant nor frequenting their company, not seen at all times, but devoting himself to the study of the Torah, wrapped in <italic>Talith</italic> and crowned with phylacteries, and doing more than his duty in all things, avoiding however, extremes and exaggerations&#x2014;such a man has sanctified God, and concerning him, Scripture saith, &#x201C;And he said unto me, &#x2018;Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I will be glorified&#x2019; &#x201D;. (Is.49:3).</p>
<p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
<p>1. Whoever destroys any one of the holy and pure Names by which the Holy One, blessed be He, is called, incurs, according to scriptural enactment, the penalty of stripes; for referring to idol-worship, it is said, &#x201C;And ye shall destroy their name out of that place. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord, your God&#x201D; (Deut. 12:3-4).</p>
<p>2. There are seven such Names. The name written JHVH.<xref rid="fn98">&#x002A;</xref> This is the Proper Name of the Deity, as it is also, when written Adonai; El; Eloah; Elohim; Eloh&#x00E9;; or Elohai; Shaddai; Zebaoth. Whoever erases even a single letter of any of these seven Names is punished with stripes.</p>
<p>3. Prefixes to these Names may be erased; as, for example, <italic>Lamed</italic> in La&#x2019;Adonai, <italic>Beth</italic> in Be&#x2019;elohim, and so forth. These and similar prefixes have not the sanctity of the Names of God. But suffixes to the Divine Name, as for instance, final <italic>Chaph</italic> in Elohecha or <italic>Chaph,</italic> and final <italic>Mem</italic> in Elohechem etc., must not be erased. They are holy like the other letters of the Divine Name, which invests them with its own sanctity. Yet, notwithstanding that they have thus been sanctified, and it is forbidden to erase them, any one who does erase such suffixes does not incur the scriptural penalty of stripes, but receives the punishment of flagellation for contumacy.</p>
<p>4. Once <italic>Aleph, Lamed</italic> of Elohim or <italic>Yod, He</italic> of JHVH has been written, it may not be erased. The rule concerning the latter is obvious, since, besides being a holy name by itself, it is part of the Tetragrammaton. But if one has written <italic>Shin, Daleth</italic> of Shaddai or <italic>Tsadi, Beth</italic> of Zebaoth, these letters may be erased.</p>
<p>5. Other epithets used to praise God, such as <italic>Gracious and Merciful, The Great, Mighty and Revered; The Faithful, Zealous and Powerful,</italic> and so on, are like the rest of The Sacred Scriptures. The erasure of these terms is permitted.</p>
<p>6. If a vessel had a divine name inscribed on it, the portion with the Name should be cut out and hidden. If such a Name is even engraved on a plate or glass vessel, one melting the vessel is punished with stripes. The portion containing the Name should be cut out and hidden. So also, if a Divine Name is written on a man&#x2019;s flesh, he must not bathe, anoint himself, or stand in an unclean place. If occasion arises for taking a ritual bath, a reed should be wound over the Name and then the bath may be taken. If he has no reed, he is to wrap his garment about that part of his body on which the name is written, not however so tightly as to prevent the access of the water, the reason for this rule being that it is forbidden to stand nude in the presence of the Divine Name.</p>
<p>7. Whoever with destructive intent demolishes a single stone of the Altar, Sanctuary or any part of the Temple Court, is punished with stripes; as it is said in reference to idolatry, &#x201C;And ye shall break down their altars&#x2026;. Ye shall not do so unto the Lord, your God.&#x201D; (Deut. 12:3-4). So also, whoever with destructive intent kindles wood belonging to the Sanctuary, is punished with stripes; as it is said, &#x201C;And burn their groves with fire&#x2026; Ye shall not do so to the Lord, your God.&#x201D; (ibid. 12:3-4).</p>
<p>8. It is forbidden to burn or otherwise by one&#x2019;s act destroy any of the Sacred Scriptures, their commentaries or expositions. Whoever by his act does so destroy them, is punished with stripes for contumacy. This rule only applies to Scriptures written by an Israelite, conscious of their sacred character. But if an Israelite who is an infidel wrote a Scroll of the Torah, it is to be burnt with all the Names of God contained therein. The reason is that he does not believe in the sanctity of the Divine Name and did not write it for its sake, but regarded it like any other writing. This being his view, the Divine Name, which he wrote, never became sanctified. It is a religious duty to burn it, so as to leave no record of infidels or their works. But if a non-Israelite wrote the Divine Name, it is put away in a place of concealment. So also, copies of Holy Writ that have become worn out or that had been written by a non-Israelite, are to be put away in such a place.</p>
<p>9. All the names (of God) occurring in the account of the Life of Abraham are holy, including that in the text, &#x201C;O Lord, if I have found favour in thy sight.&#x201D; (Gen. 18:3). All the Names (Adonai) in the Story of Lot are not holy, except the one in the text, &#x201C;Oh, not so, O Lord; behold, now, thy servant hath found grace in Thy sight&#x201D; (Gen. 19:18-19).</p>
<p>All the names (of God) occurring in the story of Gibeah of Benjamin (Judges ch. 20) are holy. Names of God in the story of Micah (Judges ch. 17) are not holy. Those in the story of Naboth (I Kings ch. 21) are holy. The name <italic>Solomon,</italic> wherever it occurs in the Song of Songs, is holy<xref rid="fn99">&#x002A;</xref> and is like other divine epithets. The one exception is that of the text &#x201C;Thou, O Solomon, shalt have the thousand&#x201D; (Canticles 8:12). Wherever the word <italic>King</italic> is found in the book of Daniel, it is a secular term except in the text, &#x201C;Thou art King, King of Kings&#x201D; (Dan. 2-37) where it is like other divine epithets.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>
<p>1. It is one of the basic principles of religion that God inspires men with the prophetic gift. But the spirit of prophecy only rests upon the wise man who is distinguished by great wisdom and strong moral character, whose passions never overcome him in anything whatsoever, but who by his rational faculty always has his passions under control, and possesses a broad and sedate mind. When one, abundantly endowed with these qualities and physically sound, enters the &#x201C;Paradise&#x201D;<xref rid="fn100">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> and continuously dwells upon those great and abstruse themes,&#x2014;having the right mind capable of comprehending and grasping them; sanctifying himself, withdrawing from the ways of the ordinary run of men who walk in the obscurities of the times, zealously training himself not to have a single thought of the vanities of the age and its intrigues, but keeping his mind disengaged, concentrated on higher things as though bound beneath the Celestial Throne, go as to comprehend the pure and holy forms <xref rid="fn101">&#x002A;</xref> and contemplating the wisdom of God as displayed in His creatures, from the first form to the very centre of the Earth, learning thence to realize His greatness&#x2014;on such a man the Holy Spirit will promptly descend. And when the spirit rests upon him, his soul will mingle with the angels called <italic>Ishim</italic><xref rid="fn102">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref>. He will be changed into another man and will realise that he is not the same as he had been, and has been exalted above other wise men, even as it is said of Saul &#x201C;And thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.&#x201D; (I Sam. 10:6).</p>
<p>2. The prophets are of various degrees. Just as one sage is greater in wisdom than another, so, in the gift of prophecy, one prophet is greater than another. All the prophets experienced prophetic manifestations only in dreams, at night, or by day after a deep sleep had fallen upon them; as it is said, &#x201C;I do make Myself known unto him in a vision. I do speak with him in a dream&#x201D; (Num. 12:6). At the time when they had the prophetic experience, their limbs trembled, their physical strength failed them, their thoughts became confused; and thus the mind was left free to comprehend the vision it saw, as is said in reference to Abraham, &#x201C;And 10, an horror of great darkness fell upon him&#x201D; (Gen. 15:12), and of Daniel, &#x201C;And my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.&#x201D; (Dan. 10:8).</p>
<p>3. The matters communicated to the prophet in a prophetic vision are communicated to him in allegorical form. Its interpretation is immediately impressed upon his mind, simultaneously with the vision, so that he grasps what it means. Such, for example, was the case with the vision the Patriarch Jacob saw (Gen. 28:12-15) of a Ladder with angels ascending and descending it&#x2014;a type of the Monarchies and their oppression of Israel; the <italic>Chaioth</italic> in Ezekiel&#x2019;s vision (Ezek. Chap. 1); the Seething Cauldron (Jerem. 1:13) and the Rod of an Almond Tree (Jerem. 1:11) seen by Jeremiah; the Scroll seen by Ezekiel (Ezekiel 2:9) and the Ephah (measure) seen by Zechariah (Zech. 5:6) and so with the rest of the prophets. Some, like these prophets, recited the allegory together with its interpretation. Others only gave forth the interpretation. Sometimes, as in the case of some prophecies of Ezekiel and Zechariah, they only recited the allegory. All the prophets prophesied in allegories and riddles.</p>
<p>4. The prophets did not prophesy whenever they pleased, but had to concentrate their minds, resting, joyous and cheerful, and in solitude. For the spirit of prophecy does not descend upon one who is melancholy or indolent, but comes as a result of joyousness. And therefore, the Sons of the Prophets had before them psaltery, tabret, pipe and harp, (I Sam. 10:5) and thus sought a manifestation of the prophetic gift. This is expressed in the phrase, &#x201C;And they were <span dir="rtl">&#x05DE;&#x05EA;&#x05E0;&#x05D1;&#x05D0;&#x05D9;&#x05DD;</span> (ibid. 10:5), which means, that they were on the way to prophesy, before they actually did so, as one might say, &#x201C;That person is becoming great.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. Those who sought the prophetic gift were called Sons of the Prophets. Although they concentrated their minds, the Divine Spirit might or might not rest upon them.</p>
<p>6. The foregoing observations refer to the manner in which prophecy was vouchsafed to all the earlier and later prophets with the exception, however, of our teacher, Moses, the chief of all the prophets. In what respects was the prophecy of Moses distinguished from that of the other prophets ? All the prophets received their inspired messages in a dream or in a vision; Moses while awake and standing, as it is said, &#x201C;And when Moses went into the tent of meeting, that He might speak with him, then he heard the Voice speaking unto him&#x201D;. (Num. 7:89). All the prophets received their messages through the medium of an angel. Hence, what they saw, they saw as an allegory or riddle&#x2014;Moses received his message not through an angel, as it is said, &#x201C;Mouth to mouth will I speak with him&#x201D; (Num. 12:8), &#x201C;The Lord spake unto Moses face to face&#x201D; (Exod. 33:11); furthermore &#x201C;And the similitude of the Lord doth he behold&#x201D; (Num. 12:8); that is to say, that it was no allegory that was revealed to Moses but he realized the prophetic message clearly, without riddle and without parable. To this, the Torah testifies in the text, &#x201C;Even manifestly, not in dark speeches&#x201D; (Num. 12:8), which means that he received his prophecy not as a riddle, but had a clear and lucid vision. All the prophets (when receiving their messages) were filled with fear and consternation and became physically weak. Not so, our teacher Moses, of whom scripture says, &#x201C;As a man speaketh unto his neighbour.&#x201D; (Ex. 33:11). Just as a man is not startled when he hears the words of his fellow-man, so the mind of Moses was vigorous enough to comprehend the words of prophecy while retaining his normal state. None of the prophets could prophesy at their pleasure. It was otherwise with Moses. He was invested with the prophetic spirit and was clothed with the power of prophecy whenever he pleased. There was no need for him specially to concentrate his mind and prepare for the prophetic manifestations; since he was ever intent and in readiness like the ministering angels. He therefore prophesied at all times; as it is said, &#x201C;Stand ye still and I will hear what the Lord will command concerning you.&#x201D; (Num. 9:8). In this regard God made him a special promise, as it is said, &#x201C;Go, say unto them: &#x2018;Return ye to your tents. But as for thee, stand thou here by me&#x2019; &#x201D;. (Deut. 5:27-28). Hence it may be inferred that all the prophets, when the prophetic power left them, returned to their tents, that is, attended to the satisfaction of their physical needs. Moses, our teacher, never went back to his former tent. He accordingly permanently separated himself from his wife, and abstained from similar gratifications. His mind was closely attached to the Rock of the Universe. The Divine Glory never departed from him; the skin of his face sent forth rays of light, and he was sanctified like the angels.</p>
<p>7. The gift of prophecy may be vouchsafed to a prophet, intended for him alone, to develop his mind and increase his knowledge, so that he may know what hitherto he had not known concerning exalted themes. Sometimes the prophet is sent on a special mission to a particular people or to the inhabitants of a certain city or kingdom, to direct them aright, teach them what they are to do or restrain them from the evil courses they were pursuing. And when so sent, a sign or token may be given him, so that the people might know that God had in truth sent him. Not every one showing a sign or token is on that account to be accepted as a prophet. Only if a man, by reason of his wisdom and conduct wherein he stands preeminent among his contemporaries, is already recognised as worthy of the prophetic gift, and his life, in its sanctity and renunciation, is favourable to the prophetic calling,&#x2014;then, when he shows a sign or token and asserts that God had sent him, is it one&#x2019;s duty to listen to his message, as it is said, &#x201C;Unto him ye shall hearken&#x201D;. (Deut. 18:15). It is, however, possible that such a man may show a sign and token and yet not be a prophet. The sign may be a mystery. Nevertheless, it is a duty to listen to him, for, being a great and wise man, worthy of the prophetic gift, we give him the benefit of the presumption. For thus too are we enjoined to decide a suit on the evidence of two competent witnesses. Though it is possible that they may have given false testimony, still having accepted them as competent witnesses, we rely on their qualification. On these and such like matters, it is said, &#x201C;The secret things belong unto the Lord, our God; but the things that are revealed, belong unto us and to our children&#x201D; (Deut. 29:28). And further it is said, &#x201C;For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart&#x201D; (I. Sam. 16:7).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VIII.</h1>
<p>1. Israel did not believe in Moses, our Teacher, on account of the tokens he showed. For when one&#x2019;s faith is founded on tokens, a lurking doubt always remains in the mind that these tokens may have been performed with the aid of occult arts and witchcraft. All the signs Moses showed in the Wilderness, he performed because they were needed, and not to support his prophetic claims. Thus, when it was necessary that the Egyptians should be drowned, he divided the Red Sea and drowned them in its depths. We needed material sustenance; he brought down the Manna for us. The people thirsted; he clave the rock for them. Korah&#x2019;s company denied his authority; the earth swallowed them up. And so with all the other tokens. What then were the grounds of the faith in him ? The Revelation on Sinai which we saw with our own eyes, and heard with our own ears, not having to depend on the testimony of others, we ourselves witnessing the fire, the thunder, the lightning, Moses entering the thick darkness after which the Divine Voice spoke to him, while we heard the call, &#x201C;Moses, Moses, go, tell them thus and thus&#x201D;. And so it is said, &#x201C;The Lord spoke with you, face to face&#x201D; (Deut. 5:4); and furthermore, &#x201C;The Lord made not this covenant with our fathers only, [but with us, <italic>even us,</italic> who are all of us here alive this day&#x201D;] (Deut. 5:3). Whence do we know that the Sinaitic Revelation is the sole proof that Moses&#x2019; prophetic mission is true ? From the text, &#x201C;Lo, I come unto thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe in thee for ever.&#x201D; (Ex. 19:9). Hence the inference that before that event they did not believe with a faith that would endure for ever, but only with a faith followed by hesitating and doubting speculation.</p>
<p>2. As those to whom Moses was sent, were themselves witnesses to the truth of his prophecy, there was no need for him to show them any other sign, since they and he were witnesses to the same matter. They were like two persons who saw an event together. When giving their testimony in such a case, each of them is a witness that the other is telling the truth, and neither need bring proof of the credibility of the other. So was it with Moses, our Teacher. After the Revelation on Sinai, all Israel became witnesses for him; and there was no need for him to show them any further sign. The Almighty indicated this to Moses at the beginning of the latter&#x2019;s career, when He gave him signs which he was to perform in Egypt, and said to him, &#x201C;They shall hearken to thy voice&#x201D; (Ex. 3:18). Moses realised that belief based on signs leaves lurking doubts and is followed by musings and speculation. He therefore sought to avoid the acceptance of his mission, and said, &#x201C;But 10, they will not believe me&#x201D; (Ex. 4:1), till the Almighty informed him that these signs were only to serve till our ancestors had departed from Egypt. &#x201C;And when they will have gone forth and stand at the foot of this mountain,&#x201D; God said to Moses, &#x201C;their doubts about thee will disappear. For here, I will give thee a sign by which they will know that it was I who sent thee from the first, and no vestige of doubt will linger in their mind&#x201D;. And this is what is meant in the text, &#x201C;And this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee; when thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God at this mountain&#x201D; (Ex. 3:12). Hence one may conclude with regard to every prophet after Moses, that we do not believe in such a prophet because of the signs he shows, as much as to say that only if he shows a sign, we shall pay heed to him in all that he says, but we believe in him, because of the charge laid down by Moses in the Torah that if the prophet gives a sign &#x201C;ye shall listen to him&#x201D;; just as the Lawgiver directed that a cause is to be decided on the evidence of two witnesses even if we have no certainty as to whether they are testifying to the truth or to a falsehood. Similarly, it is our duty to listen to the prophet though we do not know if the sign he shows is genuine or has been performed with the aid of sorcery and by secret arts.</p>
<p>3. Hence too, if a prophet were to arise and perform signs and wonders, and seek to deny the prophetic character of Moses, our teacher, we would not have to listen to him and would be clearly certain that those signs were wrought by secret arts and witchcraft. For Moses&#x2019; authority as a prophet is not founded upon signs, in which case we might have weighed the signs of one prophet against those of another. But with our eyes we saw and with our ears we heard the divine Voice, even as he (the claimant to prophecy) also heard it. To what may this be compared? To persons testifying in the presence of a man concerning an incident which he saw with his own eyes and denying that it took place as he saw it. He will surely not accept their statement, but will be convinced that they are false witnesses. The Torah accordingly ordains that even if the sign or token takes place, you are not to listen to the words of such a prophet; since he shows a sign and token in order to deny what you saw with your own eyes. As we only accept signs (as a prophet&#x2019;s credentials) because we are so bidden in the commandment given us by Moses, how shall we, on the strength of such a sign, accept a man as a prophet, who seeks to repudiate Moses&#x2019; prophecy for the truth of which we have the evidence of our own eyes and ears ?</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IX.</h1>
<p>1. It is clearly and explicity set forth in the Torah that its ordinances will endure for ever without variation, diminution or addition; as it is said, &#x201C;All this word which I command you, that shall ye observe to do; thou shalt not add to it, nor take away from it&#x201D; (Deut. 13:1); and further it is said &#x201C;but the things that are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this Law&#x201D; (Deut. 29:28). Hence the inference that to fulfil all the behests of the Torah is an obligation incumbent upon us for ever, as it is said, &#x201C;It is an everlasting statute throughout your generations&#x201D;. (Lev. 23:14, Num. 18:23). It is also said, &#x201C;It is not in heaven&#x201D; (Deut. 30:12). Hence the inference that a prophet is forbidden to make innovations in the Torah. Accordingly, if any one should arise, whether among the Gentiles or among the Israelites, and, showing a sign and token, declare that God had sent him to add a precept to the Torah or take away a precept from the Torah, or give an interpretation to any of the commandments, such as we had not heard from Moses; or should assert that the commandments ordained to Israel are not of perpetual obligation for all generations but only temporary, such a man is a false prophet, because he sets out to deny the prophecy of Moses. He is to be put to death by strangling because he spoke perversely in the name of God that which God had not bidden him, for the Lord enjoined Moses that this Commandment shall be unto us and to our children after us for ever. And God is not a man that he should lie.</p>
<p>2. Since this is so, why is it said in the Torah, &#x201C;I will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee&#x201D; (Deut. 18:18)? The answer is that the prophet here referred to, will come, not to found a religion, but to charge the people concerning the words of the Torah and exhort them not to transgress it; as the last of the prophets expressed it, &#x201C;Remember ye the law of Moses, My servant&#x201D; (Malachi 3:22). And so, if the prophet gives an order in regard to things permissible, as for instance, if he says &#x201C;Go to that place&#x201D; or &#x201C;Do not go to it&#x201D;, &#x201C;Wage war today&#x201D; or &#x201C;Do not wage war&#x201D;, &#x201C;Build this wall&#x201D; or &#x201C;Do not build it&#x201D;, it is a duty to obey him. Whoever transgresses his instructions incurs the penalty of death by the hand of God, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto the words of the prophet which he shall speak in My Name, I will require it of him.&#x201D; (Deut. 18:19).</p>
<p>3. So too, a prophet who acts contrary to his own exhortations or suppresses the prophetic message he is charged to deliver, incurs the penalty of death by the hand of God. To all the above three offences applies the text &#x201C;I will require it of him&#x201D; (Deut. 18:19). So also, if one, who is known to us as a prophet, bids us transgress on a certain occasion any precept of the Torah or several such precepts&#x2014;whether minor or major&#x2014;it is our duty to obey him. For thus were we taught by the ancient sages, on the authority of tradition, that if the prophet tells you to transgress the precepts of the Torah, as Elijah did on Mount Carmel, obey him in all matters, unless the commandment be to worship idols; this is the rule however only when the prophet&#x2019;s instruction is for a single occasion. Such was the case of Elijah at Mount Carmel. He offered up burnt offerings outside the Temple, while the Sanctuary in Jerusalem was the place appointed for such sacrifices, and any one who offered them up outside the appointed place incurred the penalty of excision. But because Elijah was a prophet, it was obligatory to heed him, and even in the above case, the rule applied &#x201C;Unto him shall ye hearken&#x201D; (Deut. 18:15). If Elijah&#x2019;s contemporaries had asked him, &#x201C;How dare we abrogate the precept, &#x201C;Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy offering in any place&#x2026;.&#x201D;(Deut. 12:13), the prophet would have replied, &#x201C;This verse only refers to one who constantly offers up sacrifices outside the Sanctuary; such a person incurs the penalty of excision prescribed by Moses. But <italic>I</italic> propose to offer up sacrifices outside the Temple, this day only, by the express commandment of God, for the purpose of discrediting the prophets of Baal.&#x201D; And thus, if prophets order the violation of a precept for a set time, it is a duty to obey the direction. But if they declare that the precept is abrogated for ever, they incur the penalty of death by strangling, for the Torah said &#x201C;Unto us and to our children for ever&#x201D;. (Deut. 29:28).</p>
<p>4. So too, if a prophet attempts to rescind any of the institutions that have come down to us by tradition, or if, in reference to a moot point, he asserts that the Almighty had instructed him as to what was the decision and that the rule was according to the view of a certain teacher, he is a false prophet, and should be strangled, even if he showed a token, since he proposes to deny the Torah which has laid down the principle &#x201C;It is not in Heaven&#x201D; (Deut. 30:12). But if his direction be only for a single occasion, we obey him in all things.</p>
<p>5. These rules apply to all precepts but not to the prohibition of idolatry. If a prophet bids us worship idols even on a single occasion, we are not to listen to him. And though he performs great signs and wonders, if he says that the Almighty commanded him that an idol should be worshipped this day only or this hour only, he speaks perversely against the Eternal. Scripture charges us in such a case, &#x201C;And even if the sign or wonder come to pass&#x2026; thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet&#x2026;., because he hath spoken perversely against the Lord, your God&#x201D;. (Deut. 13:3-4-6). Since he seeks to discredit the teaching of Moses, we know for certain that he is a false prophet; and whatever he did, was done by secret arts and with the aid of witchcraft, and he is to be strangled.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER X.</h1>
<p>1. A prophet who arises and declares that God sent him, does not need to show a sign like any of the wonders performed by Moses, Elijah or Elisha,&#x2014;all of which involved changes in the ordinary course of nature. A sufficient sign for him would be if he foretold events that would happen in the world and his predictions came true, as it is said, &#x201C;And if thou say in thy heart: &#x2018;How shall we know the word which the Lord hath spoken, etc.&#x2019;&#x201D; (Deut. 18:21). Accordingly, when a man worthy to be a prophet, comes professedly as a messenger of God, and proposes neither to add to the Law nor to take aught from it, but only exhorts his hearers to serve God by obedience to the precepts of the Torah, we do not say to him &#x201C;Divide for us the sea, or restore a dead person to life, or perform similar miracles, and then we will believe in you;&#x201D; but we say to him &#x201C;Foretell coming events&#x201D;. If he does so, we wait to see whether his predictions are fulfilled or not. And if they fail of realisation in the smallest particular, he is manifestly a false prophet. But if everything he said comes true, then he must be accepted by us as trustworthy.</p>
<p>2. He is to be tested repeatedly. If all his words are found worthy of credence, he is a true prophet, as is said of Samuel &#x201C;And all Israel, from Dan even to Beersheba, knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.&#x201D; (I. Sam. 3:20).</p>
<p>3. But observers of the times and diviners also predict the future. What is the difference, then, between them and the prophet ? The answer is that in the case of the observers of the times, diviners, and their like, part of what they say comes true while part is not fulfilled, as it is said, &#x201C;Let now the astrologers, the star-gazers, prognosticators of [some] new things that shall befall thee, arise and save thee&#x201D; (Is. 47:13). &#x201C;Of [some] new things&#x201D;, but not all new things. Possibly too, none of their forecasts will come true; and they may prove wholly mistaken, as it is said, &#x201C;that frustrateth the tokens of impostors, and maketh diviners mad&#x201D; (Is. 44:25). But as for the prophet,&#x2014;all his words come true, as it is said, &#x201C;Nothing of the word of the Lord shall fall to the earth&#x201D; (II Kings 10:10), and again it is said, &#x201C;The prophet that hath My word, let him speak My word faithfully. What hath chaff to do with the wheat, saith the Lord&#x201D;. (Jer. 23:28). This means that the words of the diviners are like chaff with which a little wheat has become mixed, but the word of God is like pure wheat, wholly free from chaff. And herein Scripture gave an assurance and declared that in all those matters on which the soothsayers and the diviners, professing to instruct nations, tell falsehoods, the prophet will give you true knowledge, so that you do not need soothsayer or diviner or the like, as it is said, &#x201C;there shall not be found among you anyone that maketh his son or his daughters to pass through the fire, [or that useth divination, or soothsayer or enchanter&#x201D;] (Deut. 18:10), &#x201C;for these nations that thou art to dispossess hearkened unto soothsayers and unto diviners; but as for thee, the Lord, thy God, hath not suffered thee so to do&#x201D; (Deut. 18:14). And the text continues, &#x201C;A prophet will the Lord, thy God, raise up unto thee, from the midst of thee, of thy brethren [like unto me; unto him shall ye hearken&#x201D;] (Deut. 18:15). Hence we learn that the prophet only has to predict coming events, as to whether there will be plenty or famine, war or peace, etc. He even may instruct an individual in regard to his private affairs; as in the instance of Saul who had suffered a loss and repaired to the prophet to tell him where the strayed asses were. To tell these and such like things is among the prophet&#x2019;s functions, but not to found a new religion, add a commandment to the Law or take a commandment from it.</p>
<p>4. As to calamities predicted by a prophet, if, for example, he foretells the death of a certain individual or declares that in a particular year there will be famine or war, and so forth, the non-fulfilment of his forecast does not disprove his prophetic character. We are not to say, &#x201C;See, he spoke, and his prediction has not come to pass&#x201D;. For God is long-suffering and abounding in kindness, and repents of the evil (He threatened). It may also be that those who were threatened repented and were forgiven, as happened to the men of Nineveh. Possibly too, the execution of the sentence is only deferred, as in the case of Hezekiah. But if the prophet, in the name of God, assures good fortune, declaring that a definite event would come to pass, and the benefit promised has not been realised, he is unquestionably a false prophet; for no blessing decreed by the Almighty, even if promised conditionally, is ever revoked. We do not find that God ever revoked aught good that He had promised; except at the destruction of the First Temple, when he promised the righteous that they would not perish with the wicked and changed his purpose. The explanation is given in the Talmudical Treatise Sabbath.<xref rid="fn103">&#x002A;</xref> Hence we learn that only when he predicts good fortune can the prophet be tested. Jeremiah expressed this in his reply to Hananiah, son of Azur, when the former prophesied evil while the latter prophesied good. Jeremiah said to Hananiah: &#x201C;If my words are not confirmed by events, that will not prove that I am a false prophet. But should your predictions not be fulfilled you will be proved a false prophet; as it is said, &#x201C;Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak,&#x2026;. the prophet that prophesied of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the Lord hath truly sent him&#x201D; (Jer. 28:7-9).</p>
<p>5. A prophet whose prophetic status has been attested by another (recognised) prophet is to be accepted as such and no further investigation is needed. For Moses vouched for Joshua whom all Israel recognised as a prophet even before he had shown any sign. And so in every period, when a prophet is known, and his messages have repeatedly been accepted, or when a prophet is vouched for by another prophet, and conducts himself consistently with the prophetic calling, he must not be made the subject of speculation and misgivings in regard to the character of his prophecy. Nor may we test him excessively. We must not be continually investigating his claims, as it is said, &#x201C;Ye shall not tempt the Lord, your God, as you tempted Him at Massah&#x201D; (Deut. 6:16), where the people asked, &#x201C;Is the Lord among us or not?&#x201D; (Ex. 17:7). Once it is known that a particular individual is a prophet, they must believe and know that God is in their midst and not harbour doubt or suspicion concerning him; as it is said, &#x201C;And they shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.&#x201D; (Ezek. 2:5).</p>

<chapter>
<title>LAWS RELATING TO MORAL DISPOSITIONS AND TO ETHICAL CONDUCT.</title>
<p>These comprise eleven precepts, five of which are affirmative and six, negative; as follows: 1) to imitate the ways of God; 2) to cleave to those that know Him; 3) to love neighbours; 4) to love the strangers; 5) not to hate brothers; 6) to rebuke; 7) not to put any one to shame; 8) not to afflict the distressed; 9) not to be a tale bearer; 10) not to avenge; 11) not to bear a grudge.</p>
<p>The exposition of these precepts is in the following chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>1. Every human being is characterised by numerous moral dispositions which differ from each other and are exceedingly divergent. One man is choleric, always irascible; another sedate, never angry; or, if he should become angry, is only slightly and very rarely so. One man is haughty to excess; another humble in the extreme. One is a sensualist whose lusts are never sufficiently gratified; another is so pure in soul that he does not even long for the few things that our physical nature needs. One is so greedy that all the money in the world would not satisfy him, as it is said, &#x201C;He who loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver&#x201D;. (Eccles. 5:9). Another so curbs his desires that he is contented with very little, even with that which is insufficient, and does not bestir himself to obtain that which he really needs. One will suffer extreme hunger for the sake of saving, and does not spend the smallest coin without a pang, while another deliberately and wantonly squanders all his property. In the same way, men differ in other traits. There are, for example, the hilarious and the melancholy, the stingy and the generous, the cruel and the merciful, the timid and the stout-hearted, and so forth.</p>
<p>2. Between any moral disposition and its extreme opposite, there are intermediate dispositions more or less removed from each other. Of all the various dispositions, some belong to one from the beginning of his existence and correspond to his physical constitution. Others are such that a particular individual&#x2019;s nature is favourably predisposed to them and prone to acquire them more rapidly than other traits. Others again are not innate, but have been either learnt from others, or are self-originated, as the result of an idea that has entered the mind or, having heard that a certain disposition is good for him and should be cultivated by him, one trained himself in it till it became part of his nature.</p>
<p>3. To cultivate either extreme in any class of dispositions is not the right course nor is it proper for any person to follow or learn it. If a man finds that his nature tends or is disposed to one of these extremes, or if one has acquired and become habituated to it, he should turn back and improve, so as to walk in the way of good people, which is the right way.</p>
<p>4. The right way is the mean in each group of dispositions common to humanity; namely, that disposition which is equally distant from the two extremes in its class, not being nearer to the one than to the other. Hence, our ancient sages exhorted us that a person should always evaluate his dispositions and so adjust them that they shall be at the mean between the extremes, and this will secure his physical health. Thus a man should not be choleric, easily moved to anger, nor be like the dead without feeling; but should aim at the happy medium; be angry only for a grave cause that rightly calls for indignation, so that the like shall not be done again. He will only desire that which the body absolutely needs and cannot do without, as it is said, &#x201C;The righteous eats, to satisfy himself&#x201D; (Prov. 13:25). He will only labour at his occupation to obtain what is necessary for his sustenance, as it is said, &#x201C;A little that a righteous man hath is better [than the riches of many wicked&#x201D;] (Ps. 37:16). He will not be tight-fisted nor yet a spendthrift, but will bestow charity according to his means and give a suitable loan to whoever needs it. He will be neither frivolous and given to jesting, nor mournful and melancholy, but will rejoice all his days tranquilly and cheerfully. And so will he comport himself with regard to all his other dispositions. This is the way of the wise. Whoever observes in his dispositions the mean is termed wise.</p>
<p>5. Whoever is particularly scrupulous and deviates somewhat from the exact mean in disposition, in one direction or the other, is called a saint. For example, if one avoids haughtiness to the utmost extent and is exceedingly humble, he is termed a saint, and this is the standard of saintliness. If one only departs from haughtiness as far as the mean, and is humble, he is called wise, &#x2014;and this is the standard of wisdom. And so with all other dispositions. The ancient saints trained their dispositions away from the exact mean towards the extremes; in regard to one disposition in one direction; in regard to another in the opposite direction. This was supererogation. We are bidden to walk in the middle paths which are the right and proper ways, as it is said, &#x201C;and thou shalt walk in His ways&#x201D; (Deut. 28:9).</p>
<p>6. In explanation of the text just quoted, the sages taught, &#x201C;Even as God is called gracious, so be thou gracious; Even as He is called merciful, so be thou merciful; even as He is called holy, so be thou holy&#x201D;. Thus too the prophets described the Almighty by all the various attributes &#x201C;long-suffering and abounding in kindness, righteous and upright, perfect, mighty and powerful,&#x201D; and so forth, to teach us, that these qualities are good and right and that a human being should cultivate them, and thus imitate God, as far as he can.</p>
<p>7. How shall a man train himself in these dispositions, so that they become ingrained? Let him practise again and again the actions prompted by those dispositions which are the mean between the extremes, and repeat them continually till they become easy and are no longer irksome to him, and so the corresponding dispositions will become a fixed part of his character. And as the Creator is called by these attributes, which constitute the middle path in which we are to walk, this path is called the Way of God and this is what the patriarch Abraham taught his children, as it is said &#x201C;For I love him, because he will charge his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord&#x201D; (Gen. 18:19). Whoever walks in this way secures for himsself happiness and blessing, as the text continues, &#x201C;In order that the Lord might bring upon Abraham that which He spoke concerning him&#x201D; (Gen. 18:19).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. To those who are sick in body, the bitter tastes as if it were sweet, and the sweet as if it were bitter. Among sick folk, some long and yearn for things unfit for food, such as earth and charcoal, and have an aversion to wholesome foods, like bread and meat&#x2014;the perversity depending on the severity of the illness. Similarly, human beings whose souls are sick and love evil dispositions, and hate the way that is good and are too indolent to walk therein, and find it exceedingly irksome because of their sickness. And so Isaiah says of such people, &#x201C;O, they that say of evil that it is good, and of good that it is evil, that turn darkness into light and light into darkness, who take bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter&#x201D; (Is. 5:20). And of such it is also said, &#x201C;Who forsake the paths of integrity to walk in the ways of darkness&#x201D; (Prov. 2:13). What is the corrective for those that are sick in soul ? They should go to the wise who are physicians of the soul and they will heal their maladies by instructing them in the dispositions which they should acquire till they are restored to the right path. Of those who realise that their dispositions are bad and nevertheless do not resort to the wise to be cured, Solomon says, &#x201C;Wisdom and discipline, fools despise&#x201D; (Prov. 1:7).</p>
<p>2. What is the method of effecting their cure ? If one is irascible, he is directed so to govern himself that even if he is assaulted or reviled, he should not feel affronted. And in this course he is to persevere for a long time till the choleric temperament has been eradicated. If one is arrogant, he should accustom himself to endure much contumely, sit below every one, and wear old and ragged garments that bring the wearer into contempt, and so forth, till arrogance is eradicated from his heart and he has regained the middle path, which is the right way. And when he has returned to this path, he should walk in it the rest of his days. On similar lines, he should treat all his dispositions. If, in any of them, he is at one extreme, he should move to the opposite extreme, and keep to it for a long time till he has regained the right path which is the normal mean in every class of dispositions.</p>
<p>3. There are some dispositions in regard to which it is forbidden merely to keep to the middle path. They must be shunned to the extreme. Such a disposition is pride. The right way in this regard is not to be merely meek, but to be humble-minded and lowly of spirit to the utmost. And therefore was it said of Moses that he was &#x201C;<italic>exceedingly</italic> meek,&#x201D; (Num. 12:3), not merely that he was &#x201C;meek&#x201D;. Hence, our sages exhorted us, &#x201C;Be exceedingly, exceedingly lowly of spirit&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:4). They also said that any one who permits his heart to swell with haughtiness has denied the essential principle of our religion, as it is said, &#x201C;And thy heart will be proud, and thou wilt forget the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 8:14). Again have they said, &#x201C;Under a ban be he who is proud, even in the smallest degree&#x201D;. Anger too, is an exceedingly bad passion, and one should avoid it to the last extreme. One should train oneself not to be angry even for something that would justify anger. If one wishes to arouse fear in his children and household, or in the members of a community of which he is the head, and desires to exhibit anger, so that they may amend their ways, he should make a show of anger before them, so as to correct them, but in reality, his mind should be composed like that of a man who simulates anger and does not really feel it. The ancient sages said, &#x201C;He who is angry&#x2014;it is the same as if he worshipped idols.&#x201D; They also said, &#x201C;One who yields to anger, &#x2014;if he is a sage, his wisdom departs from him; if he is a prophet, his prophetic gift departs from him.&#x201D; Those of an irate disposition&#x2014;their life is not worth living. The sages therefore, charged us that anger should be avoided to such a degree that one should train oneself to be unmoved even by things that naturally would provoke anger; and this is the good way. The practice of the righteous is to suffer contumely and not inflict it; to hear themselves reproached, not retort; to be impelled in what they do by love, and to rejoice in suffering. Of them Scripture saith, &#x201C;And they that love Him are like the going forth of the sun in his strength.&#x201D; (Judges 5:31).</p>
<p>4. One should always cultivate the habit of silence, and only converse on topics of wisdom or on matters of moment to one&#x2019;s existence. Of Rav, disciple of our sainted teacher (R. Judah, the Prince) it was said that throughout his life he never indulged in idle conversation, of which most people&#x2019;s talk consists. And even of our material needs, we should not speak much. In this connection, our wise men charged, &#x201C;He who multiplies words causes sin&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers, 1:17). They further said, &#x201C;I have found naught of better service to the body than silence&#x201D; (ibid.). So too, in discussing Torah and Wisdom, a man&#x2019;s words should be few but full of meaning. This, the sages express in their recommendation: &#x201C;A man should always teach his disciples tersely&#x201D;. But where words are many and their meaning is small&#x2014;that is folly, of which it is said, &#x201C;For the dream cometh with much discussion, and a fool&#x2019;s voice with an abundance of words&#x201D; (Eccles. 5:2).</p>
<p>5. &#x201C;A fence to wisdom is silence&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers, 3:17). Hence, a man should not be hasty in reply, nor talk much. He should teach his pupils gently and calmly, not shouting, and avoiding prolixity. Solomon said, &#x201C;The words of the wise, spoken quietly, are heard&#x201D; (Eccles. 9:17).</p>
<p>6. It is forbidden to accustom oneself to smooth speech and flatteries. One must not say one thing and mean another. Inward and outward self should correspond; only what we have in mind, should we utter with the mouth. We must deceive no one, not even an idolater. A man, for example, must not sell to an idolater flesh from a beast that has died naturally, as if it were meat of an animal ritually slaughtered. Nor should one sell a shoe, the leather of which came from the hide of a beast that met with a natural death, allowing it to be believed that the leather had come from the hide of a ritually slaughtered animal. One must not urge another to join one at a meal, when one is aware that the invitation will not be accepted. Nor should one press upon another any marks of friendship which one knows will be declined. So too, casks of wine, which must be opened for sale, should not be broached in such a way as to deceive a guest and make him believe that they had been opened in his honour, and so forth. Even a single word of flattery or deception is forbidden. A person should always cherish truthful speech, an upright spirit and a pure heart free from all frowardness and perversity.</p>
<p>7. One should not indulge in jesting and mockery nor be melancholy and mournful, but one should be cheerful. So our sages said, &#x201C;Jesting and levity lead a man on to lewdness&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers, 3:17). They further charged that a man should not give way to immoderate laughter, nor yet be sad and mournful but should receive everyone with a cheerful countenance. One should also not cherish large desires&#x2014;hurrying to get rich, &#x2014; nor be melancholy and idle, but should be contented, engage a little in secular occupation and devote oneself to the study of the Torah, and rejoice in the little one has as his portion. One should not be quarrelsome, jealous, or sensual; nor run after honour. Thus our wise men said, &#x201C;Envy, lust and ambition take a man from the world&#x201D; (Ethics of Fathers, 4:2). In fine, in every class of dispositions, a man should choose the mean so that all one&#x2019;s dispositions shall occupy the exact middle between the extremes. This is what Solomon expressed in the text, &#x201C;Balance the course of thy steps, so that all thy ways may be right&#x201D; (Prov. 4:26).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. Possibly a person may say: &#x201C;Since envy, cupidity and ambition are evil qualities to cultivate and lead to a man&#x2019;s ruin, I will avoid them to the uttermost, and seek their contraries.&#x201D; A person following this principle, will not eat meat, nor drink wine, nor marry nor dwell in a decent home, nor wear comely apparel, but will clothe himself in sackcloth and coarse wool like the idolaters&#x2019; priests. This too, is the wrong way, not to be followed. Whoever persists in such a course is termed a sinner. Of the Nazirite, it is said &#x201C;He (the priest) shall make atonement for him, for the sin that he committed against the soul.&#x201D; (Num. 6:11). On this text, the Sages comment, &#x201C;If the Nazirite who only abstained from wine stands in need of an atonement, how much more so one who deprives himself of all legitimate enjoyments.&#x201D; The Sages accordingly enjoined us that we should only refrain from that which the Torah has expressly withdrawn from our use. And no one should, by vows and oaths, inhibit to himself the use of things permitted. &#x201C;Do not the prohibitions of the Torah&#x201D;, say our sages, &#x201C;suffice thee, that thou addest others for thyself ?&#x201D; In this condemnation, those are included, who make a practice of fasting; they too are not walking in the right way; our wise men prohibited self-mortification by fasting. And concerning this and similar excesses Solomon exhorts us, &#x201C;Be not overrighteous, nor excessively wise. Wherefore shouldst thou be desolate?&#x201D; (Eccles. 7:16).</p>
<p>2. A man should direct all his thoughts and activities to the knowledge of God, alone. This should be his aim in sitting, rising and conversation. How should this be caried out ? Whether engaged in commerce or in manual labour for profit, one&#x2019;s heart should not be solely set on the accumulation of wealth, but he should do these things in order to obtain therewith his bodily needs&#x2014;food, drink, shelter, the demands of married life. So too, when he eats, drinks, or cohabits, his purpose should not be to secure physical gratification, in which case he would only eat and drink that which was pleasing to the palate, and cohabit for the sake of sensual pleasure, but he should have it in mind that he eats and drinks solely to maintain his body and its organs in health and vigour. He will then not partake of everything which the palate craves, like a dog or an ass, but will choose foods that are wholesome to the body, whether these be sweet or bitter; and will avoid eating things that are injurious to the body, even though they taste sweet. One, for instance, who is of a hot humour, will not eat flesh-meat or honey, nor drink wine, as Solomon said in a metaphorical sense, &#x201C;It is not good to eat much honey&#x201D;. (Prov. 25:27). Such a person should rather drink an infusion of chicory, even though it is bitter. And so, since life is impossible without eating and drinking, he will be guided in his choice of food and drink by hygienic considerations, to recover and maintain sound health. Thus too, in married life, his purpose in cohabitation will be to preserve health or propagate his species. He will consequently not indulge in intercourse whenever the desire seizes him, but only when he is conscious that emission is hygienically necessary or when his purpose is to continue his race.</p>
<p>3. He who regulates his life in accordance with the laws of hygiene, with the sole motive of maintaining a sound and vigorous physique and begetting children to do his work and labour for his benefit, is not following the right course. A man should aim to maintain physical health and vigour, in order that his soul may be upright, in a condition to know God. For it is impossible for one to understand sciences and meditate upon them, when he is hungry or sick, or when any of his limbs is aching. And in cohabitation, one should set one&#x2019;s heart on having a son who may become a sage and a great man in Israel. Whoever throughout his life follows this course will be continually serving God, even while engaged in business and even during cohabitation, because his purpose in all that he does will be to satisfy his needs. so as to have a sound body with which to serve God. Even when he sleeps and seeks repose, to calm his mind and rest his body, so as not to fall sick and be incapacitated from serving God, his sleep is service of the Almighty. In this sense, our wise men charged us, &#x201C;Let all thy deeds be for the sake of God.&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 2: 17). And Solomon, in his wisdom, said, &#x201C;In all thy ways know Him, and He will make thy paths straight.&#x201D; (Prov. 3:6).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. Since, by keeping the body in health and vigour, one walks in the ways of God&#x2014;it being impossible during sickness to have any understanding or knowledge of the Creator&#x2014;it is a man&#x2019;s duty to avoid whatever is injurious to the body, and cultivate habits conducive to health and vigour. These are as follows: One should not take food except when one is hungry; nor drink unless one is thirsty. One should not neglect the calls of nature for a single moment, but respond to them immediately.</p>
<p>2. Food should not be taken to repletion; during a meal, about one-third less should be eaten than the quantity that would give a feeling of satiety, and only a little water should be drunk&#x2014;and that mixed with wine. After the process of digestion has commenced, water may be taken as needed. But even after food has been digested, it should not be drunk copiously. Before eating, careful attention should be paid to the functions of excretion. No meal should be taken without previously walking till the body begins to get warm, or engaging in manual labour, or tiring oneself with other activities. In short, strenuous exercise should be taken every day in the morning, till the body is in a glow. Then, there should be an interval of rest till one has recovered composure. The meal may then be taken. If the exercise is followed by a bath of warm water, so much the better. In this case too, there should be an interval for repose before the meal.</p>
<p>3. During a meal, one should sit or recline on the left side; but not walk, ride, take violent exercise, sway the body, or engage in sport, till the food is digested. Any one who engages in sport or violent exercise immediately after a meal, subjects himself to grave disorders.</p>
<p>4. The day and night consist of twenty-four hours. It is sufficient to sleep for a third of that period, namely eight hours. And these hours should be in the latter part of the night; that is to say, the period from retirement to dawn should be eight hours so that one will rise from his bed before dawn.</p>
<p>5. One should not sleep, face downwards, nor on one&#x2019;s back, but lying on the side; at the beginning, on the left side, and at the close of one&#x2019;s rest, on the right side. One should not go to sleep immediately after a meal, but only when three or four hours have elapsed. One should not sleep during the day.</p>
<p>6. Laxative foods, such as grapes, figs, mulberries, pears, watermelons, the various kinds of cucumbers or gherkins, should be taken before the meal. These, however, should not be mixed with the main dish that constitutes the meal. An interval should elapse till these have passed out of the stomach before the meal is taken. Immediately after, foods that tone up the digestive organs, should be eaten, such as pomegranates, quinces, apples and small pears;<xref rid="fn104">&#x002A;</xref> but even these fruits must not be indulged in too freely.</p>
<p>7. When it is desired to eat at the same meal poultry and the meat of cattle, the poultry should be eaten first. When eggs and poultry form part of the same meal, the eggs should be consumed first. When the meat of large and of small cattle are eaten at the same meal, the latter should come first. The lighter should always precede the heavier diet.</p>
<p>8. In the summer time, cold food should be consumed; one should be sparing with condiments; vinegar should be used. During winter, warm foods should be eaten; condiments should be liberally used with a little mustard and assafoetida. A similar plan should be followed in cold and warm countries. The diet, in every district, should be chosen to suit the climate.</p>
<p>9. Some foods are very injurious and ought never be eaten. For example, large salted stale fish; salted stale cheese; truffles and mushrooms; stale salted meat; <italic>must</italic> (fresh wine taken from the wine press); cooked food kept so long that it has lost its savour; any food that is malodorous or very bitter&#x2014;all these are like deadly poison to the body. There are other kinds of food that are injurious but not to the same extent as those just mentioned. A little of them at a time may therefore be taken, but only at intervals of several days. One should not accustom oneself to make a meal of them or to eat them regularly with the meal. Examples of this class are large fish; cheese; milk, twenty-four hours after milking; the meat of big steers and big goats; beans, lentils, peas; barley bread; unleavened bread; cabbage; leeks, onions, garlic; mustard and raddish. All these are bad foods. They should be eaten very sparingly and only during winter. In the summer, they should not be eaten at all. Neither in summer nor in winter should beans or lentils be eaten as a separate dish. Gourds may be eaten in summer.</p>
<p>10. There are other kinds of food that are also bad, but not to the extent of those just mentioned. These are waterfowl, small young pigeons, dates, bread fried in oil or the dough of which was kneaded with oil, fine meal so completely sifted that not a trace of bran remained, meat juice, and brine of salted fish. These should not be freely used. A man who is wise and exercises self-control, who does not yield to his appetite and never partakes of the above named foods, unless he needs them as a medicine, is indeed a hero &#x0021;</p>
<p>11. One should always be abstemious in regard to fruits which grow on trees. These should not be eaten freely, even when dried, and, needless to add, when they are fresh. Before they are quite ripe, thy are like daggers to the body. So too locust (St. John&#x2019;s bread) is always bad. All sour fruits are bad and should be eaten sparingly, and only during summer or in hot climates. But figs, grapes and almonds are always good to eat&#x2014;whether fresh or dried and may be eaten as much as one needs; but they should not be eaten constantly, even though they are the best of the tree-fruits.</p>
<p>12. Honey and wine are bad for young children, but good for the aged, particularly in the winter. The quantity taken in the summer should be two-thirds of that consumed in the winter.</p>
<p>13. At every period of life, it should be one&#x2019;s care to secure free action of the bowels, approximating to a relaxed condition. It is a leading principle in medicine that if there is constipation or if the bowels move with difficulty, grave disorders result. How is a slight costive condition to be remedied ? If the patient is a youth, he should eat, every morning, salty foods well cooked and seasoned with olive oil, fish brine and salt, without bread. Or he should drink the liquid of boiled spinach or, St. John&#x2019;s bread, mixed with olive oil, fish brine and salt. An old man should drink, in the morning, honey diluted with warm water, and wait about four hours before taking his breakfast. This regimen should be observed for one day, or, if necessary, for three or four successive days till the bowels move freely.</p>
<p>14. Another great principle of hygiene, physicians say, is as follows: As long as a person takes active exercise, works hard, does not over-eat and keeps his bowels open, he will be free from disease and will increase in vigour, even though the food he eats is coarse.</p>
<p>15. But if one leads a sedentary life and does not take exercise, neglects the calls of nature, or is constipated&#x2014;even if he eats wholesome food and takes care of himself in accordance with medical rules&#x2014;he will, throughout his life, be subject to aches and pains and his strength will fail him. Over-eating is like a deadly poison to any constitution and is the principal cause of all diseases. Most maladies that afflict mankind result from bad food or are due to the patient filling his stomach with an excess of food that may even have been wholesome. Thus, Solomon, in his wisdom, said, &#x201C;He who keeps his mouth and tongue, keeps his soul from troubles.&#x201D; (Prov. 21:23)&#x2014;which text can be applied to the individual who guards his mouth from bad food and over-eating, and keeps his tongue from all speech except that which is necessary to obtain his needs.</p>
<p>16. The correct procedure in bathing is to take a bath once a week. One should not step into the bath directly after a meal nor when hungry, but only after digestion has begun. The entire body should be bathed in water that is warm but not scalding. The head alone may be washed with water hot enough to scald the body. The body should then be washed in tepid water, then in lukewarm water, and so on, gradually reducing the temperature, till the water finally used is quite cold. Water, either lukewarm or cold, should not be poured upon the head. In the rainy season cold baths should not be taken. Nor should one rinse the body before it has perspired and become supple. Nor should one stay too long in the bath, but as soon as one perspires and the body has become supple, one should complete the ablutions and leave. Before and after bathing, attention should be paid to the excretory functions, as also before and after eating a meal, before and after sexual intercourse, before and after physical exercise, before going to bed and on rising. There are thus altogether ten occasions on which this rule should be followed.</p>
<p>17. When one has come out of the bath, he should put on his clothes and cover his head in the outer chamber, so as to avoid catching cold. Even in summer, this precaution should be taken. After leaving the bath, a person should wait a while till he has recovered his composure, and his body is rested and cool. Then a meal may be taken. A little sleep, after leaving the bath and before the meal, is excellent. Cold water should not be drunk after bathing and certainly not while taking the bath. If, after the bath, one feels thirsty and cannot resist the desire to drink, the water should be mixed with wine or honey and then it may be drunk. During the winter, anointing the body with oil, after the final ablution, is beneficial.</p>
<p>18. One should not accustom oneself to being frequently bled. Recourse to this procedure should only be had in case of special need. One should not be bled in summer or in winter, and only to a slight extent in the month of Nissan and Tishri. After the age of fifty, this treatment should be entirely discontinued. A person should not be bled and take a bath on the same day or set out on a journey on the same day; nor should one be bled on the day when he has returned from a journey. On the day when one is bled, less food and drink should be taken than usual. On that day, he should rest, avoid exertion and violent physical exercise, and not take part in sport.</p>
<p>19. <italic>Semen</italic> constitutes the strength of the body, its life and the light of the eyes. Its emission to excess causes physical decay, debility and diminished vitality. Thus, Solomon, in his wisdom, said: &#x201C;Give not thy strength unto women&#x201D;. (Prov. 31:3). Whosoever indulges in sexual dissipation becomes prematurely aged; his strength fails; his eyes become dim; a foul odour proceeds from his mouth and armpits; the hair of his head, eye-brows and eye-lashes drop our; the hair of his beard, armpits and legs grow abnormally; his teeth fall out; and besides these, he becomes subject to numerous other diseases. Medical authorities have stated that for each one who dies of other maladies, a thousand are the victims of sexual excess. A man should, therefore, be careful in this regard if he wishes to lead a happy life. He should only cohabit when he finds himself in good health and vigour, experiences involuntary erections which persist after he has diverted his mind to other things, is conscious of a heaviness from the loins downwards as if the spermatic cords were being drawn and his flesh is hot. Such a condition calls for cohabitation which then is conducive to health. One should not cohabit, when sated with food, nor when one is hungry but only after a meal has been digested. Before and after coition, attention should be paid to the excretory functions. Coition should not take place in a standing or sitting posture, nor in a bath house, nor on the day when one takes a bath or is bled, nor on the day when one sets out on a journey or has returned from a journey, nor on the day previous to any of such days or subsequent to them.</p>
<p>20. Whoever lives in accordance with the directions I have set forth, has my assurance that he will never be sick till he grows old and dies; he will not be in need of a physician, and will enjoy normal health as long as he lives&#x2014;unless his constitution be congenitally defective, or he has acquired bad habits from his early childhood, or if the world should be visited by pestilence or drought.</p>
<p>21. All the useful rules here recommended are suitable to those who enjoy good health. But a person who is generally ailing or suffers from a local disorder, or has for several years been addicted to an evil habit, needs special treatment, according to the nature of his sickness&#x2014;as is expounded in medical literature. &#x201C;Change of mode of living is the beginning of sickness&#x201D;.</p>
<p>22. In a place where there is no physician, both those that are well and those that are ailing should not diverge from the methods prescribed in this chapter. The observance of every one of them will yield beneficial results.</p>
<p>23. No disciple of the wise may live in a city that is unprovided with the following ten officials and institutions, namely: a physician, a surgeon, a bath-house, a lavatory, a source of water supply such as a stream or a spring, a synagogue, a school teacher, a scribe, a treasurer of charity funds for the poor, a court that has authority to punish with stripes and imprisonment.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>
<p>1. Even as a sage is recognized by his wisdom and moral principles which distinguish him from the rest of the people, so ought he to be recognized in all his activities, in his food and drink, in the fulfillment of his marital obligations, in attention to his excretory functions, in his talk, walk, dress, management of his affairs and business transactions. All these activities should bear the mark of exceeding refinement and orderliness. For example, a scholar will not be a glutton but will eat food conducive to health; and of such food he will not eat to excess. He will not be eager to fill his stomach, like those who gorge themselves with food and drink till the body swells. Concerning such people, the Scripture saith, &#x201C;I will spread dung on your faces&#x201D; (Malachi 2:3). This text, our wise men say, refers to those who eat and drink and spend all their days as if they were holidays. They are the people who exclaim, &#x201C;Eat and drink, for tomorrow we die&#x201D;. (Is. 22:13). This is how the wicked eat. They are reprobated in the verse, &#x201C;For all tables are full of filthy vomit, and no place is clean&#x201D; (Is. 28:8). The wise man, on the contrary, will only partake of one or two courses, of which he will consume as much as he needs to sustain him. Thus, Solomon said, &#x201C;The righteous eateth to satisfy himself&#x201D; (Prov. 13:25).</p>
<p>2. When the wise man eats the modest meal that is proper for him, he will consume it nowhere else than at home, at his own table. Except in extreme emergencies, he will not eat in a restaurant or in the street, so as not to incur popular contempt. He will not accept invitations to take meals with unrefined people, nor will he sit down at tables that are not clean. He will not make it a practice to take his meal in all sorts of places, even in the company of scholars. He will not eat at banquets where there is a large crowd. It is indeed improper for a scholar to accept an invitation to any banquet unless it partakes of a religious character, as for example, on the occasion of a betrothal or a marriage, and then only when the bridegroom is a scholar, and the bride, a scholar&#x2019;s daughter. The righteous and saints in ancient times never ate anywhere but at home.</p>
<p>3. When a sage drinks wine, he will only take enough to moisten the food which he has eaten. Any one who allows himself to become inebriated is a sinner and despicable, and loses his wisdom. If he becomes intoxicated in the presence of the ignorant, he has profaned the Name (of God). It is forbidden to drink wine at noon, in however small a quantity, unless it forms part of a meal; for, if it is then taken, it does not intoxicate. We have to be on our guard only in respect to wine drunk after the meal is over.</p>
<p>4. Although connubial intercourse with one&#x2019;s wife is always permitted, still this relation too should be invested by the scholar with sanctity. He should not be always with his spouse, after the manner of a rooster, but should fulfill his marital obligation on Friday nights, if he is in a physically vigorous condition. Cohabitation should take place not at the beginning of the night when one is satiated and the stomach is full, nor towards the close of the night when one feels hungry, but at midnight, when the food is digested. He should not indulge in excessive frivolity, nor defile his mouth with lewd talk, even when he is alone with his wife. For the text, &#x201C;He declareth to a man what is his discourse&#x201D; (Amos 4:13), was interpreted by our sages traditionally to mean that &#x201C;a man will be called to account even for light conversation between him and his wife&#x201D;. When cohabiting, neither husband nor wife should be in a state of intoxication, lethargy or melancholy. The wife should not be asleep at the time. The husband is not to force her, if she is unwilling. Coition should take place with the consent of both, and while they are full of desire and joyousness. The husband should converse and jest with his wife for a little while, so as to put her in a pleasant frame of mind and then cohabit modestly and not shamelessly. After the completion of the act, he should at once separate from her.</p>
<p>5. Whoever observes this procedure not only hallows his soul, purifies his heart and refines his mind, but if he has children, they will be comely, modest, and disposed to wisdom and saintliness. One who follows the customs of the common people who walk in darkness, will have children like theirs.</p>
<p>6. Extreme modesty is cultivated by scholars. They will not do aught that might expose them to contempt. They will not bare their heads or body. Even when responding to a call of nature, the scholar will behave decently; not bare himself till he sits down, nor dry himself with his right hand; he will withdraw from all people to the most private part of his dwelling or of a cave; or if he relieves himself behind a fence, he will withdraw to a distance so that others may not hear him. If he relieves himself in an open plain, he will go so far away that nobody can see his bare body. While relieving himself, he will not talk, even if there be great need. And as he conducts himself decently by day, so will he behave at night. One should get into the habit of relieving oneself in the morning and the evening, so as not to have to traverse long distances.</p>
<p>7. A scholar, when speaking, will not shout or scream, like domestic cattle or wild beasts. He will not raise his voice unduly. His speech with all men will be gentle. But while speaking gently, he will be careful to avoid exaggeration which would make his speech sound affected, like the speech of the haughty. He will be the first to greet every one he meets, so that they will be well disposed towards him. He will judge every one favourably. He will dwell on the merits of others and never speak disparagingly of anybody. He loves peace and ensues it. If he feels that his words will be effective and heeded, he will speak; otherwise, he will remain silent. For instance, he will not attempt to appease his neighbour when the latter is exasperated, nor question him concerning his vows immediately after he has made them, but will wait till the man&#x2019;s mind has become cool and composed. He will not attempt to console the mourner while the dead still lies unburied; for till the body is interred, the mourner&#x2019;s mind is preoccupied. And thus he will behave in circumstances of a similar kind. He will not show himself in his neighbour&#x2019;s presence when that person is in disgrace, but will avoid meeting him. He will not deviate from the truth; neither add to it nor detract from it, except in the interest of peace or similar worthy aims. In short, he will limit his speech to topics of wisdom, benevolence, and the like. He will not enter into conversation with a woman on the street, not even with his wife, sister, or daughter.</p>
<p>8. The scholar will not walk with proud mien and outstretched neck&#x2014;attitudes condemned in the text &#x201C;They walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes&#x201D; (Is. 3:16). He will not walk mincingly and with short steps after the fashion of women and the haughty, as it is said &#x201C;Walking mincingly as they go and making a tinkling noise with their feet&#x201D; (Is. 3:16). He will not run in the street, after the manner of madmen, nor will he stoop, bent double like a hunchback, but will look towards the ground as one does when praying and will walk at the pace of a man busy with his affairs. A person&#x2019;s gait indicates whether he is wise and sensible or a foolish idiot. Thus Solomon, in his wisdom, said &#x201C;Yea also, when a fool walketh by the way, his understanding faileth him, and he proclaimeth to every one that he is a fool&#x201D; (Eccles. 10:3); that is, by his behaviour he advertises himself as a fool.</p>
<p>9. A scholar&#x2019;s dress will be becoming and clean. It is an offence for such a man if a stain or grease or the like is found on his garment. He should not put on robes befitting royalty, such as those embroidered with gold or purple, which attract universal attention; nor, on the other hand, shabby garments such as are worn by the poor, which bring contempt upon the wearer, but he will wear apparel suitable to the middle classes and that is neat. His flesh should not show under the clothing, as is the case with the extremely light linen fabrics manufactured in Egypt. His garments should not drag on the ground like those worn by the arrogant, but should only reach to the heels, while the sleeves may extend to the finger-tips. He should not let down his fringed garment&#x2014;this being a mark of arrogance&#x2014;except on Sabbaths, if he has no other change of garments. He should not, in summer, wear clouted shoes, with patch upon patch; but in winter, this is permitted if one is poor. He should not go forth into the street with his person or garments perfumed; nor should he apply perfume to his hair; but if he anoints his body with perfume, in order to remove unpleasant effluvium&#x2014;this is permitted. So too, he should not go out at night alone, unless at the fixed hour when he has to attend a course of study. The object of all these rules is to save one from being suspected (of following evil courses).</p>
<p>10. The scholar manages his affairs with judgment and prudence; spends on food, drink, and maintenance of his household, in accordance with his income and the state of his finances. He will not put himself to excessive trouble (to be considered wealthy). The wise men recommended in their rules for right living, that a man should not eat flesh meat, unless he longs for it, as it is said &#x201C;Because thy soul desireth to eat flesh&#x201D; (Deut. 12:20). For a healthy individual it is enough to eat meat once a week, on Friday evenings. But, if one is rich enough to eat meat every day, he may do so. The sages charged that a person should eat less than he can afford; dress in accordance with his means and as befits his station in life; and spend on his wife and children more than he can afford in order to secure respect for them.</p>
<p>11. The sensible course is for a man first to choose an occupation that will give him a livelihood, then buy himself a home; and after that, take a wife; as it is said &#x201C;And what man is there that hath planted a vineyard and not redeemed it ?&#x2026;. What man is there that has built a new house and hath not dedicated it ?&#x2026;. and what man is there that hath betrothed a woman and not taken her?&#x2026;. (Deut. 20:6-5-7). But the foolish first marry; then if one of this sort can afford it, he purchases a house; and, last of all, towards the end of his life, he sets about seeking a trade or lives on charity. Thus it is said in <italic>the Imprecations,</italic> &#x201C;A wife shalt thou betroth&#x2026; a house shalt thou build&#x2026; a vineyard shalt thou plant&#x201D; (Deut. 28:30); that is, all your activities shall be in the reverse order of what they should be, so that you will not prosper in your ways. And a blessing is conveyed in the Scriptural text &#x201C;And David had success in all his ways; and the Lord was with him&#x201D; (1. Sam. 18:14).</p>
<p>12. A person is forbidden to declare all his property derelict or devote it to the sanctuary and thus become a public charge. He should not sell a field and buy a house with the proceeds; or sell a house and buy movables, or use the money in trade; but he may sell movables and buy a field. To sum up, he should make it his aim to employ his capital successfully (and convert the perishable into the durable<xref rid="fn105">&#x002A;</xref>); and not to snatch a little pleasure for a while, or gain a little enjoyment and thereby incur a great loss.</p>
<p>13. The scholar conducts his business affairs honestly and in good faith. His nay is nay; his yea, yea. In his accounts, he is strict (in meeting his obligations). At the same time, when buying, he is liberal and does not drive a hard bargain. He pays promptly for his purchases. He declines to act as a surety or trustee; nor will he accept a power of attorney. In commercial matters, he acknowledges liability even where the law would not hold him liable; his principle being to keep his word and not change it. If others have been adjudged liable to him, he is considerate, and even forgives them the amount due. He grants benevolent<xref rid="fn106">&#x002A;</xref> loans and does favours. He will not encroach on another man&#x2019;s business, and throughout his life will not vex a human being. In short, he belongs to the class of those who are persecuted but do not persecute, who are reviled but do not revile. A man who acts thus is commended in the Scriptural text &#x201C;And He said unto me, thou art my servant, Israel, in whom I glory&#x201D; (Is. 49:3).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI.</h1>
<p>1. It is natural to be influenced, in sentiments and conduct, by one&#x2019;s neighbours and associates, and observe the customs of one&#x2019;s fellow citizens. Hence, a person ought constantly to associate with the righteous and frequent the company of the wise, so as to learn from their practices, and shun the wicked who are benighted, so as not to be corrupted by their example. So Solomon saith &#x201C;He that walketh with the wise, shall be wise; but the companion of fools shall smart for it&#x201D; (Prov. 13:20). And it is also said &#x201C;Happy is the man that hath not walked in the counsel of the wicked&#x201D; (Psalms 1:1). So too, if one lives in a country where the customs are pernicious, and the inhabitants do not go in the right way, he should leave for a place where the people are righteous and follow the ways of the good. If all the countries of which he has personal knowledge, or concerning which he hears reports, fellow a course that is not right&#x2014;as is the case in our times&#x2014;or if military campaigns or sickness debar him from leaving for a country with good customs, he should live by himself in seclusion, as it is said, &#x201C;Let him sit alone and keep silence&#x201D; (Lam. 3:28). And if the inhabitants are wicked reprobates who will not let him stay in the country unless he mixes with them and adopts their evil practices, let him withdraw to caves, thickets or deserts, and not habituate himself to the ways of sinners, as it is said &#x201C;O that I were in the wilderness, in a lodging place of wayfaring men&#x201D; (Jerem. 9:1).</p>
<p>2. It is an affirmative precept to attach oneself to sages and their disciples, so as to learn from their example; as it is said, &#x201C;And unto Him shalt thou cleave&#x201D; (Deut. 10:20). But can a human being cleave to the <italic>Shechinah</italic> ? Our wise men explained this text thus: &#x201C;Attach thyself to sages and their disciples&#x201D;. A man should, accordingly, strive to win a scholar&#x2019;s daughter for a wife, and should give his daughter in marriage to a scholar. He should eat and drink in the company of scholars; give them opportunities to do business, and cultivate their society in every relation, as it is said &#x201C;And to cleave unto Him&#x201D; (Deut. 11:22). So too, our sages exorted us &#x201C;Sit in the dust of their feet, and drink their words thirstily&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 1:4).</p>
<p>3. It is incumbent on every one to love each individual Israelite as himself, as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt love they neighbour, as thyself&#x201D; (Lev. 19:18). Hence, a person ought to speak in praise of his neighbour and be careful of his neighbour&#x2019;s property as he is careful of his own property and solicitous about his own honour. Whoever glorifies himself by humilitating another person, will have no portion in the world to come.</p>
<p>4. To love the proselyte who comes to take refuge beneath the wings of the <italic>Shechinah</italic> is the fulfilment of two affirmative precepts. First, because he is included among neighbours (whom we are commanded to love) (Lev. 19:18). And secondly, because he is a stranger, and the Torah said &#x201C;Love ye therefore the stranger&#x201D; (Deut. 10:19). God charged (us) concerning the love of the stranger, even as He charged us concerning love of Himself, as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt love the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 6:5). The Holy One, blessed be He, loves strangers, as it is said &#x201C;And He loveth the stranger&#x201D; (Deut. 10:18).</p>
<p>5. Whoever entertains in his heart hatred of any Israelite, transgresses a prohibition, as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart&#x201D; (Lev. 19:17). The violation of this precept is however not punished with stripes, as no overt act is involved. The Torah, in this text, only warned against hatred in the heart. But any one who smites or reviles his neighbour, although he is not permitted to do so, is not infringing the precept &#x201C;Thou shalt not hate thy brother&#x201D;.</p>
<p>6. When a man sins against another, the injured party should not hate the offender and keep silent, as it is said concerning the wicked &#x201C;And Absalom spake to Amnon neither good nor evil, for Absalom hated Amnon&#x201D; (2. Sam. 13:22). But it is his duty to inform the offender and say to him &#x201C;Why did you do this to me ? Why did you sin against me in this matter ?&#x201D; And thus it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour&#x201D; (Lev. 19:17). If the offender repents and pleads for forgiveness, he should be forgiven. The forgiver should not be obdurate, as it is said &#x201C;And Abraham prayed unto God&#x201D; (for Abimelech) (Gen. 20:17).</p>
<p>7. If one observes that a person committed a sin or walks in a way that is not good, it is a duty to bring the erring man back to the right path and point out to him that he is wronging himself by his evil courses, as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt surely rebuke thy neighbour&#x201D; (Lev. 19:17). He who rebukes another, whether for offences against the rebuker himself or for sins against God, should administer the rebuke in private, speak to the offender gently and tenderly, and point out that he is only speaking for the wrongdoer&#x2019;s own good, to secure for him life in the world to come. If the latter accepts the rebuke, well and good. If not, he should be rebuked a second, and a third time. And so one is bound to continue the admonitions, till the sinner assaults the admonisher and says to him &#x201C;I refuse to listen&#x201D;. Whoever is in a position to prevent wrongdoing and does not do so, is responsible for the iniquity of all the wrongdoers whom he might have checked.</p>
<p>8. He who rebukes another must not at first speak to the offender harshly so as to put him to shame, as it is said &#x201C;And thou shalt not suffer sin because of him&#x201D; (Lev. 19:17). Our Rabbis explained this text as follows: &#x201C;Since it might have been supposed that you are to rebuke the sinner till he changes colour, therefore it is said &#x201C;And thou shalt not bear sin because of him&#x201D;. Hence, the inference that it is forbidden to put an Israelite to shame, especially in public. Although one who puts another to shame is not punished with stripes, still it is a grave offence. And thus the sages said, &#x201C;He who shames another in public has no portion in the world to come&#x201D;. One ought therefore to beware of publicly shaming anyone, whether he be young or old. One should not call a person by a name of which he feels ashamed, nor relate anything in his presence which humiliates him. This applies to matters between man and man. But in regard to duties to God, if an individual, after having been privately rebuked, does not repent, he should be shamed in public; his sin should be openly declared; he is to be reviled, affronted and cursed till he returns to the right course. This was the method followed by all the prophets of Israel.</p>
<p>9. If one who has been wronged by another, does not wish to rebuke or speak to the offender because the latter is a very common person or mentally defective, and if he has sincerely forgiven him, and neither bears him ill-will nor rebukes him&#x2014;he acts according to the standard of saints. All that the Torah objects to is harbouring ill-will.</p>
<p>10. A man ought to be especially heedful of his behaviour towards widows and orphans, for their souls are exceedingly depressed and their spirits low. Even if they are wealthy, even if they are the widow and orphans of a king, we are specifically enjoined concerning them, as it is said &#x201C;Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child&#x201D; (Ex. 22:21). How are we to conduct ourselves towards them? One must not speak to them otherwise than tenderly. One must show them unvarying courtesy; not hurt them physically with hard toil, nor wound their feelings with harsh speech. One must take greater care of their property than of one&#x2019;s own. Whoever irritates them, provokes them to anger, pains them, tyrranizes over them, or causes them loss of money, is guilty of a transgression, and still more so, if one beats them or curses them. Though no stripes are inflicted for this transgression, its punishment is explicitly set forth in the Torah (in the following terms) &#x201C;My wrath shall wax hot, and I will slay you with the sword&#x201D; (Ex. 22:23). He who created the world by His word made a covenant with widows and orphans that when they will cry out because of violence, they will be answered; as it is said, &#x201C;If thou afflict them in any wise&#x2014;for if they cry at all unto Me, I will surely hear their cry&#x201D; (Ex. 22:22). This only applies to cases where a person afflicts them for his own ends. But if a teacher punishes orphan children in order to teach them Torah or a trade, or lead them in the right way&#x2014;this is permissible. And yet he should not treat them like others but make a distinction in their favour. He should guide them gently, with the utmost tenderness and courtesy, whether they are bereft of a father or mother, as it is said &#x201C;For the Lord will plead their cause&#x201D; (Prov. 22:23). To what age are they to be regarded in these respects as orphans ? Till they reach the age when they no longer need an adult on whom they depend to train them and care for them, and when each of them can provide for all his wants, like other grown-up persons.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>
<p>1. Whoever tells tales about another person violates a prohibition, as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people&#x201D; (Lev. 19:16). And although no stripes are inflicted, it is a grave offence, and leads to the death of many souls in Israel. Hence, this precept is followed immediately by the sentence &#x201C;Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour&#x201D; (Lev. 19:16). For an example of the tragic consequence of this transgression, read what happened after Doeg&#x2019;s report concerning the priests of Nob. (I. Sam. 22:6-19).</p>
<p>2. Who is a tale-bearer ? One who carries reports, and goes about from one person to another and says &#x201C;So-and-so said this&#x201D;; &#x201C;Such and such a statement have I heard about so-and so&#x201D;. Even if what he says or repeats may be true, the tale-bearer ruins the world. There is a still graver offence that comes within this prohibition, namely, the evil tongue.<xref rid="fn107">&#x002A;</xref> This means talking disparagingly of anyone, even though what one says is true; but he who utters falsehood is called a slanderer. A person with an evil tongue is one who, sitting in company, says &#x201C;That person did such a thing&#x201D;; &#x201C;So and so&#x2019;s ancestors were so and so&#x201D;; &#x201C;I have heard this about him&#x201D;; and then proceeds to talk scandal. Of such a person, Scripture says &#x201C;May the Lord cut off all smooth lips, the tongue that speaketh proud things&#x201D;. (Ps. 12:4).</p>
<p>3. The sages say &#x201C;There are three offences for which one is punished in this world and forfeits his portion in the world to come. These are idolatry, incest and murder; but the evil tongue is equal to all the three put together&#x201D;. The sages further said &#x201C;To indulge in evil speech is like a denial of the fundamental principle of religion, as it is said &#x201C;Who said &#x2018;our tongue will we make mighty; our lips are with us; who is lord over us ?&#x2019; &#x201D; (Ps. 12:5). The sages also said &#x201C;The evil tongue slays three persons: the utterer of evil, the listener, the one spoken about; and the listener will be punished worse than the speaker&#x201D;.</p>
<p>4. There are modes of speech that may be styled &#x201C;dust of the evil tongue&#x201D;. Such are remarks like the following: &#x201C;Who would have thought of so-and-so that he would be as he is now.<xref rid="fn108">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> Or &#x201C;be silent about so-and-so. I do not wish to tell what happened, etc.&#x201D; To speak in a person&#x2019;s favour in the presence of his enemies, savours of the evil tongue. For it will provoke them to speak of him disparagingly. Referring to this, Solomon said &#x201C;He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse unto him&#x201D; (Prov. 27:14). For out of what had been said to his good, proceedeth evil. Such too is the case of one who indulges in evil speech jokingly and frivolously, and not out of hatred. And so, Solomon, in his wisdom, says &#x201C;As one who mockingly casteth firebrands, arrows and death, and saith, am I not jesting?&#x201D; (Prov. 26:18). Equally reprehensible is one who indulges in evil speech deceitfully, that is, speaks as it were in all innocence, as if unaware that what he says is an evil utterance, and when a protest is made, replies, &#x201C;I do not know that this is evil speech, or that such is the conduct of so-and-so&#x201D;.</p>
<p>5. Whether one indulges in evil speech about a person in his presence, or in his absence, or makes statements which, if repeated, would tend to hurt him physically or injure him financially, distress or alarm him&#x2014;all this is evil speech. If a statement of this character had been made in the presence of three persons, the subject matter is regarded as public and generally known, and if one of the three repeats it, he is not guilty of evil speech, provided he had no intention to give the story wider currency.</p>
<p>6. All such persons are scandal-mongers in whose neighbourhood it is forbidden to reside; and still more is it forbidden to cultivate their society and listen to them. The sentence passed upon our forefathers in the wilderness was confirmed, only because they were guilty of the sin of the evil tongue.</p>
<p>7. He who takes revenge, violates a prohibition, and it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt not take vengeance&#x201D; (Lev. 19:18). And although he is not punished with stripes, still such conduct indicates an exceedingly bad disposition. One should rather practise forbearance in all secular matters. For the intelligent realise that these are vain things and not worth taking vengeance for. What is &#x201C;taking vengeance&#x201D;? The following is a case. A neighbour says to one, &#x201C;Lend me your axe&#x201D;. He replies &#x201C;I will not lend it to you&#x201D;. The next day, the latter needs a similar favour from the neighbour and says to him &#x201C;Lend me <italic>your</italic> axe&#x201D;, and receives the reply &#x201C;I will not lend it to you, for you did not lend me your axe when I asked it of you&#x201D;. Any one who acts in this way is &#x201C;taking vengeance.&#x201D; But when he comes to borrow aught, one should give what is asked cheerfully, and not repay discourtesy with discourtesy. And so in similar cases. Thus David, expressing his excellent sentiments, said &#x201C;If I have requited him that did evil unto me, or despoiled mine adversary&#x201D; &#x2026;(Ps. 7:5).</p>
<p>8. So too, one who bears a grudge against a fellow-Israelite violates a prohibition, as it is said, &#x201C;Nor bear a grudge against the children of thy people&#x201D; (Lev. 19:18). What is &#x201C;bearing a grudge ?&#x201D; A said to B, &#x201C;Let this house to me, or let me borrow this ox&#x201D;. B refuses. After a time, B comes to A to borrow or hire something. A replies &#x201C;Here it is. I lend it to you. I am not like you. I will not treat you as you treated me&#x201D;. One who acts thus, transgresses the commandment &#x201C;Thou shalt not bear a grudge&#x201D;. One should blot the thing out of his mind and not bear a grudge. For as long as one nurses a grievance and keeps it in mind, one may come to take vengeance. The Torah, accordingly, emphatically warns us not to bear a grudge, so that the impression of the wrong shall be quite obliterated and be no longer remembered. This is the right principle. It alone makes civilized life and social intercourse possible.</p>

<chapter>
<title>LAWS CONCERNING THE STUDY OF THE TORAH</title>
<h2>BLESSED BE GOD WHO HATH AIDED US.</h2>
<p>Comprising two affirmative precepts, namely:</p>
<p>1) to study the Torah; 2) to honour its teachers and those versed in it.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>Women, slaves and the young (under the age of puberty) are exempt from the obligation of studying Torah. But it is a duty of the father to teach his young son Torah; as it is said, &#x201C;And ye shall teach them, to your children, talking of them&#x201D; (Deut. 11:19). A woman is under no obligation to teach her son, since only one whose duty it is to learn has a duty to teach.</p>
<p>2. Just as it is a man&#x2019;s duty to teach his son, so it is his duty to teach his grandson, as it is said, &#x201C;Make them known unto thy children and thy children&#x2019;s children&#x201D; (Deut. 4:9). This obligation is to be fulfilled not only towards a son and grandson. A duty rests on every scholar in Israel to teach all disciples (who seek instruction from him), even if they are not his children, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children&#x201D; (Deut. 6:7). On traditional authority, the term &#x201C;thy children&#x201D; includes disciples, for disciples too are called children, as it is said &#x201C;And the sons of the prophets came forth&#x201D; ((II Kings 2:3). This being so, why does the precept (concerning instruction) specifically mention (Deut. 4:9) a man&#x2019;s son and son&#x2019;s son ? To impress upon us that the son should receive instruction in preference to a grandson, and a grandson in preference to another man&#x2019;s son.</p>
<p>3. A father (who cannot teach his son) is bound to engage a paid teacher for him. But the only obligation one owes to a neighbour&#x2019;s son is to teach him when it involves no expense. If a father has not had his son taught, it is the duty of the latter, as soon as he realises his deficiencies, to acquire knowledge for himself, as it is said, &#x201C;That ye may learn them and observe to do them&#x201D; (Deut. 5:1). And so too, you will find that study in all cases takes precedence of practice, since study leads to practice, but practice does not lead to study.</p>
<p>4. If a man needs to learn Torah and has a son who needs instruction, his own requirements are to be satisfied first. But if his son has better capacity and greater ability to grasp what he learns, then the son&#x2019;s education takes precedence. Still, even in this case, the father must not wholly neglect the study of the Torah. For, just as it is incumbent on him to have his son taught, so is he under an obligation to obtain instruction for himself.</p>
<p>5. A man should always first study Torah and then marry; for if he takes a wife first, his mind will not be free for study. But if his physical desires are so overpowering as to preoccupy his mind, he should marry and then study Torah.</p>
<p>6. When should a father commence his son&#x2019;s instruction in Torah ? As soon as the child begins to talk, the father should teach him the text &#x201C;Moses commanded us a law&#x201D; (Deut. 33:4), and the first verse of the <italic>Shema</italic> (&#x201C;Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One&#x201D;) (Deut. 6:4). Later on, according to the child&#x2019;s capacity, the father should teach him a few verses at a time, till he attains the age of six or seven years, when he should take him to a teacher of young children.</p>
<p>7. If it is the custom of the country for a teacher of children to receive remuneration, the father is to pay the fee, and it is his duty to have his son taught, even if he has to pay for the instruction, till the child has gone through the whole of the Written Law. Where it is the custom to charge a fee for teaching the Written Law, it is permissible to take payment for such instruction. It is forbidden however to teach the Oral Law for payment, for it is said &#x201C;Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as the Lord, my God, commanded me&#x201D; (Deut. 4:5). This means: &#x201C;Even as I (Moses) learnt (from God) without payment, so have ye learnt from me, gratuitously. And throughout the generations, whenever you teach, do so gratuitously, even as you learnt from me&#x201D;. If a person cannot find any one willing to teach him without remuneration, he should engage a paid teacher, as it is said &#x201C;Buy the truth&#x201D; (Prov. 23:23). It should not however be assumed that it is permissible to take pay for teaching. For the verse continues &#x201C;And sell it not&#x201D;, the inference being, that even where a man had been obliged to pay for instruction (in the Oral Law), he is nevertheless forbidden to charge, in his turn, for teaching it.</p>
<p>8. Every Israelite is under an obligation to study Torah, whether he is poor or rich, in sound health or ailing, in the vigour of youth or very old and feeble. Even a man so poor that he is maintained by charity or goes begging from door to door, as also a man with a wife and children to support, are under the obligation to set aside a definite period during the day and at night for the study of the Torah, as it is said &#x201C;But thou shalt meditate therein day and night&#x201D; (Joshua 1:8).</p>
<p>9. Among the great sages of Israel, some were hewers of wood, some, drawers of water, while others were blind. Nevertheless, they devoted themselves by day and by night to the study of the Torah. They are included among the transmitters of the tradition in the direct line from Moses.</p>
<p>10. Until what period in life ought one to study Torah ? Until the day of one&#x2019;s death, as it is said, &#x201C;And lest they (the precepts) depart from thy heart all the days of thy life&#x201D; (Deut. 4:9). Whenever one ceases to study, one forgets.</p>
<p>11. The time allotted to study should be divided into three parts. A third should be devoted to the Written Law; a third to the Oral Law; and the last third should be spent in reflection, deducing conclusions from premises, developing implications of statements, comparing dicta, studying the hermeneutical principles by which the Torah is interpreted, till one knows the essence of these principles, and how to deduce what is permitted and what is forbidden from what one has learnt traditionally. This is termed Talmud.</p>
<p>12. For example, if one is an artizan who works at his trade three hours daily and devotes nine hours to the study of the Torah, he should spend three of these nine hours in the study of the Written Law, three in the study of the Oral Law, and the remaining three in reflecting on how to deduce one rule from another. The words of the Prophets are comprised in the Written Law, while their exposition falls within the category of the Oral Law. The subjects styled <italic>Pardes</italic> (Esoteric Studies), are included in <italic>Talmud.</italic> This plan applies to the period when one begins learning. But after one has become proficient and no longer needs to learn the Written Law, or continually be occupied with the Oral Law, he should, at fixed times, read the Written Law and the traditional dicta, so as not to forget any of the rules of the Torah, and should devote all his days exclusively to the study of Talmud, according to his breadth of mind and maturity of intellect.</p>
<p>13. A woman who studies Torah will be recompensed, but not in the same measure as a man, for study was not imposed on her as a duty, and one who performs a meritorious act which is not obligatory will not receive the same reward as one upon whom it is incumbent and who fulfills it as a duty, but only a lesser reward. And notwithstanding that she is recompensed, yet the Sages have warned us that a man shall not teach his daughter Torah, as the majority of women have not a mind adequate for its study but, because of their limitations, will turn the words of the Torah into trivalities. The sages said &#x201C;He who teaches his daughter Torah&#x2014;it is as if he taught her wantonness&#x201D; This stricture refers only to instruction in the Oral Law. With regard to the Written Law, he ought not to teach it to her; but if he has done so, it is not regarded as teaching her wantonness.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. Teachers of young children are to be appointed in each province, district and town. If a city has made no provision for the education of the young, its inhabitants are placed under a ban, till such teachers have been engaged. And if they persistently neglect this duty, the city is excommunicated, for the world is only maintained by the breath of school children.</p>
<p>2. Children are to be sent to school at the age of six or seven years, according to the strength of the individual child and its physical development. But no child is to be sent to school under six years of age. The teacher may chastise his pupils to inspire them with awe. But he must not do so in a cruel manner or in a vindictive spirit. Accordingly, he must not strike them with whips or sticks, but only use a small strap. He is to teach them the whole day and part of the night, so as to train them to study by day and by night. And there is to be no holiday except on the eve of the Sabbath or festival, towards the close of the day, and on festivals. On Sabbaths, pupils are not taught a new lesson, but they repeat what they had already learnt previously, even if only once. Pupils must not be interrupted at their studies, even for the re-building of the Temple.</p>
<p>3. A teacher who leaves the children and goes out (when he should be teaching them), or does other work while he is with them, or teaches lazily, falls under the ban &#x201C;Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord with a slack hand&#x201D; (Jer. 48:10). Hence, it is not proper to appoint any one as teacher unless he is God-fearing and well versed in reading and in grammar.</p>
<p>4. An unmarried man should not keep school for the young because the mothers come to see their children. Nor should any woman keep school, because the fathers come to see them.</p>
<p>5. Twenty-five children may be put in charge of one teacher. If the number in the class exceeds twenty-five but is not more than forty, he should have an assistant to help with the instruction. If there are more than forty, two teachers must be appointed.</p>
<p>6. A child may be transferred from one teacher to another who is more competent in reading or grammar, only however, if both the teacher and the pupil live in the same town and are not separated by a river. But we must not take the child to school in another town nor even across a river in the same town, unless it is spanned by a firm bridge, not likely soon to collapse.</p>
<p>7. If one of the residents in an alley or even in a court wishes to open a school, his neighbours cannot prevent him. Nor can a teacher, already established, object to another teacher opening a school next door to him, either for new pupils or even with the intention of drawing away pupils from the existing school, for it is said, &#x201C;The Lord was pleased for His righteousness&#x2019; sake, to make the Torah great and glorious&#x201D; (Is. 42:21).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. With three crowns was Israel crowned &#x2014; with the crown of the Torah, with the crown of the priesthood and with the crown of sovereignty. The crown of the priesthood was bestowed upon Aaron, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall be unto him and unto his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood&#x201D; (Num. 25:13). The crown of sovereignty was conferred upon David, as it is said, &#x201C;His seed shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before Me&#x201D; (Ps. 89:37). The crown of the Torah however is for all Israel, as is it said, &#x201C;Moses commanded us a law, an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob&#x201D; (Deut. 33:4). Whoever desires it can win it. Do not suppose that the other two crowns are greater than the crown of the Torah, for it is said, &#x201C;By me, kings reign and princes decree justice. By me, princes rule&#x201D; (Prov. 8:15-16). Hence the inference, that the crown of the Torah is greater than the other two crowns.</p>
<p>2. The sages said &#x201C;A bastard who is a scholar takes precedence of an ignorant High Priest; for it is said &#x201C;More precious it is than rubies&#x201D; (Prov. 3:15), that is (more to be honoured is the scholar) than the High Priest who enters the Innermost sanctuary.<xref rid="fn109">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>3. Of all precepts, none is equal in importance to the study of the Torah. Nay, study of the Torah is equal to them all, for study leads to practice. Hence, study always takes precedence of practice.</p>
<p>4. If the opportunity of fulfilling a specific precept would interrupt the study of the Torah and the precept can be performed by others, one should not intermit study. Otherwise, the precept should be performed and then the study be resumed.</p>
<p>5. At the Judgment hereafter, a man will first be called to account in regard to his fulfilment of the duty of study, and afterwards concerning his other activities. Hence, the sages said, &#x201C;A person should always occupy himself with the Torah, whether for its own sake or for other reasons. For study of the Torah, even when pursued from interested motives, will lead to study for its own sake.</p>
<p>6. He whose heart prompts him to fulfil this duty properly, and to be crowned with the crown of the Torah, must not allow his mind to be diverted to other objects. He must not aim at acquiring Torah as well as riches and honour at the same time. &#x201C;This is the way for the study of the Torah. A morsel of bread with salt thou must eat, and water by measure thou must drink; thou must sleep upon the ground and live a life of hardship, the while thou toilest in the Torah&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 6:4). &#x201C;It is not incumbent upon thee to complete the task; but neither art thou free to neglect it&#x201D; (ibid 2:21). &#x201C;And if thou hast studied much Torah, thou hast earned much reward. The recompense will be proportionate to the pains&#x201D; (ibid 5:26).<xref rid="fn110">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>7. Possibly you may say: When I shall have accumulated money, I shall resume my studies; when I shall have provided for my needs and have leisure from my affairs, I shall resume my studies. Should such a thought enter your mind, you will never win the crown of the Torah. &#x201C;Rather make the study of the Torah your fixed occupation&#x201D; (ibid 1:15) and let your secular affairs engage you casually, and do not say: &#x201C;When I shall have leisure, I shall study; perhaps you may never have leisure&#x201D; (ibid 2:5).</p>
<p>8. In the Torah it is written, &#x201C;It is not in heaven&#x2026;. neither is it beyond the sea&#x201D; (Deut. 30:12-13). &#x201C;It is not in heaven&#x201D;, this means that the Torah is not to be found with the arrogant; &#x201C;nor beyond the seas&#x201D;, that is, it is not found among those who cross the ocean. Hence, our sages said &#x201C;Nor can one who is engaged overmuch in business grow wise&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 2:6). They have also exhorted us &#x201C;Engage little in business and occupy thyself with the Torah&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:12).</p>
<p>9. The words of the Torah have been compared to water, as it is said, &#x201C;O every one that thirsteth, come ye for water&#x201D; (Is. 55:1); this teaches us that just as water does not accumulate on a slope but flows away, while in a depression it stays, so the Words of the Torah are not to be found in the arrogant or haughty but only in him who is contrite and lowly in spirit, who sits in the dust at the feet of the wise and banishes from his heart lusts and temporal delights; works a little daily, just enough to provide for his needs, if he would otherwise have nothing to eat, and devotes the rest of the day and night to the study of the Torah.</p>
<p>10. One however who makes up his mind to study Torah and not work but live on charity, profanes the name of God, brings the Torah into contempt, extinguishes the light of religion, brings evil upon himself and deprives himself of life hereafter, for it is forbidden to derive any temporal advantage from the words of the Torah. The sages said &#x201C;Whoever derives a profit for himself from the words of the Torah is helping on his own destruction&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:17). They have further charged us &#x201C;Make not of them a crown wherewith to aggrandise thyself, nor a spade wherewith to dig&#x201D; (ibid 4:7). They likewise exhorted us &#x201C;Love work, hate lordship&#x201D; (ibid. 1:10). &#x201C;All study of the Torah, not conjoined with work, must, in the end, be futile, and become a cause of sin&#x201D; (ibid 2:2). The end of such a person will be that he will rob his fellow-creatures.</p>
<p>11. It indicates a high degree of excellence in a man to maintain himself by the labour of his hands. And this was the normal practice of the early saints. Thus, one secures all honour and happiness here and hereafter, as it is said &#x201C;When thou eatest of the labour of thine hands, happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee&#x201D; (Ps. 128:2). Happy shalt thou be in this world, and it shall be well with thee in the world to come, which is altogether good.</p>
<p>12. The words of the Torah do not abide with one who studies listlessly, nor with those who learn amidst luxury, and high living, but only with one who mortifies himself for the sake of the Torah, constantly enduring physical discomfort, and not permitting sleep to his eyes nor slumber to his eyelids. &#x201C;This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent&#x201D; (Num. 19:14). The sages explained the text metaphorically thus: &#x201C;The Torah only abides with him who mortifies himself in the tents of the wise.&#x201D; And so Solomon, in his wisdom, said &#x201C;If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small indeed&#x201D; (Prov. 24:10). He also said &#x201C;Also my wisdom stood unto me&#x201D; (Eccles 2:9). This is explained by our wise men thus, &#x201C;The wisdom that I learnt in wrath,<xref rid="fn111">&#x002A;</xref>&#x2014;this has remained with me.&#x201D; The sages said &#x201C;There is a solemn covenant that anyone who toils at his studies in the Synagogue,<xref rid="fn112">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> will not quickly forget.&#x201D; He who toils privately in learning, will become wise, as it is said &#x201C;With the lowly (literally, <italic>the reserved</italic>) is wisdom&#x201D; (Prov. 11:2). If one recites aloud while studying, what he learns will remain with him. But he who reads silently soon forgets.</p>
<p>13. While it is a duty to study by day and by night, most of one&#x2019;s knowledge is acquired at night. Accordingly, when one aspires to win the crown of the Torah, he should be especially heedful of all his nights and not waste a single one of them in sleep, eating, drinking, idle talk and so forth, but devote all of them to study of the Torah and words of wisdom. The sages said &#x201C;That sound of the Torah has worth, which is heard by night, as it is said &#x2018;Arise, cry out in the night&#x2019; (Lam. 2:19): and whoever occupies himself with the study of the Torah at night&#x2014;a mark of spiritual grace distinguishes him by day, as it is said, &#x2018;By day the Lord will command His loving kindness, and in the night His song shall be with me, even a prayer unto the God of my life&#x2019; (Ps. 42:9). A house wherein the words of the Torah are not heard at night will be consumed by fire, as it is said &#x2018;All darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not blown by man shall consume him&#x201D; (Job 20:26). &#x2018;Because he hath despised the word of the Lord&#x2019; (Num. 15:31)&#x2014;this refers to one who has utterly neglected (the study of) the words of the Torah.&#x201D;. And, so too, one who is able to occupy himself with the Torah and does not do so, or who had read Scripture and learnt <italic>Mishnah</italic> and gave them up for wordly inanities, and abandoned and completely renounced this study, is included in the condemnation, &#x201C;Because he hath despised the Word of the Lord&#x201D;. The sages said, &#x201C;Whoever neglects the Torah because of wealth, will, at last be forced to neglect it owing to poverty. And whoever fulfills the Torah in poverty, will ultimately fulfill it amidst wealth&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:11, with order of sentences reversed). And this is explicitly set forth in the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;Because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things, therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy&#x201D; (Deut. 28:47-48). It is also said &#x201C;That He might afflict thee&#x2026;. to do thee good at thy latter end&#x2026;.&#x201D; (Deut. 8:16).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. Torah should only be taught to a worthy pupil whose conduct is exemplary or whose disposition is simple. One however who walks in a way that is not good should first be reclaimed, trained in the right way and tested (as to his sincerity); then he is admitted into the <italic>Beth Hamidrash</italic> (College) and given instruction. The sages say: &#x201C;To teach a pupil who is unworthy is like casting a stone to Mercury (the idol), as it is said, &#x201C;As one puts a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool&#x201D;<xref rid="fn113">&#x002A;</xref> (Prov. 26:8). There is no honour but the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;The wise shall inherit honour&#x201D; (Prov. 3:35). So too, if a teacher does not walk in the right way&#x2014;even if he is a great scholar and all the people are in need of him&#x2014;instruction is not to be received from him till he reforms; as it is said, &#x201C;For the priest&#x2019;s lips shall keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts&#x201D; (Mal. 2:7). Our sages applied this text thus: &#x201C;If the teacher is like an angel of the Lord of Hosts, they may seek the Law from his mouth. But if he is not, then they shall not seek the Law from his mouth.&#x201D;</p>
<p>2. How is instruction to be imparted ? The teacher is seated in the schoolroom facing the class, with the pupils around him like a crown, so that they can all see him and hear his words. The teacher is not to sit on a stool while his pupils are seated on the floor. Either all sit on the floor, or all on stools. Formerly the teacher used to be seated, while the pupils stood. But before the destruction of the Second Temple, it already had become the universal custom that pupils, while being taught, should be seated.</p>
<p>3. If it was his custom to teach the pupils personally, he may do so. If however, he taught through a <italic>Meturgeman</italic> (an interpreter), the latter stands between him and his pupils. The teacher addresses the interpreter, who declaims what he has just heard to all the pupils. And when they put questions to the interpreter, he asks the teacher. The teacher replies to the interpreter who addresses the answer to the one who put the question. The teacher should not raise his voice above the interpreter&#x2019;s voice. Nor should the latter raise his voice above that of the teacher, when he addresses a question to him. The interpreter may not detract aught from the teacher&#x2019;s words, nor add to them nor vary them&#x2014;unless he is the teacher&#x2019;s father or instructor. In addressing the interpreter, the teacher uses the introductory formula: &#x201C;Thus my revered preceptor said to me&#x201D; or &#x201C;Thus my revered father said to me&#x201D;. But when the interpreter repeats the words to the listener, he recites them in the name of the sage quoted, and mentions the name if he were the teacher&#x2019;s father or teacher, and says &#x201C;Thus said our Master so-and-so&#x201D; (naming him). He does so, even if the teacher abstained from naming the sage on the ground that it is forbidden to mention one&#x2019;s teacher or father by name.</p>
<p>4. If the teacher taught and his pupils did not understand, he should not be angry with them or fall into a rage, but should repeat the lesson again and again till they have grasped the full meaning of the Halacha (rule) he is expounding. So also, the pupil should not say &#x201C;I understand&#x201D; when he has not understood, but should ask again and again. And if the master is angry with him and storms at him, he should say &#x201C;Master, it is Torah. I need to learn, and my intellectual capacities are deficient.&#x201D;</p>
<p>5. A disciple should not feel ashamed before his fellow-students who grasp the lesson after hearing it once or twice, while he needs to hear it several times before he knows it. For if this makes him feel ashamed, he will go through college without having learnt anything. The ancient sages accordingly said, &#x201C;A bashful man cannot learn, nor a passionate man teach&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 2:6). These observations only apply when the students&#x2019; lack of understanding is due to the difficulty of the subject or to their mental deficiency. But if the teacher clearly sees that they are negligent and indolent in their study of the Torah and that this is the cause of their failure to understand, it is his duty to scold them and shame them with words of reproach, and so stimulate them to be keen. And in this regard, the sages said &#x201C;Arouse awe in the pupils&#x201D;. It is thus improper for a teacher to indulge in frivolity before his pupils, or to jest in their presence, or eat and drink with them&#x2014;so that the fear of him be upon them, and they will thus learn from him quickly.</p>
<p>6. Questions are not to be put to the teacher immediately on his entering the school, but only after his mind is composed. Nor should a pupil put a question as soon as he has come in, but only after he himself is composed and rested. Two pupils are not to put questions at one time. The teacher is not to be questioned on a topic not pertaining to the lesson, but only on the subject that is being treated, so as not to embarrass him. The teacher however should set &#x201C;pitfalls&#x201D; before his pupils, both in his questions and in what he does in their presence, in order to sharpen their wits, and ascertain whether they remember what he had taught them or do not remember it. Needless to add, that he has the right to question them on a subject other than that on which they are at the moment engaged, in order to stimulate them to be diligent in study.</p>
<p>7. No questions should be asked standing, nor answers given standing; nor should they be addressed by any one from an elevation, or from a distance, or when one is behind the elders. The teacher may only be questioned on the topic that is being studied. The questions are to be put in a respectful manner. One should not ask concerning more than three Halachoth (rules) in the topic.</p>
<p>8. Two individuals put questions. One of these questions is germane to the subject under discussion, while the other is not. Heed is given to the question that is germane. One question refers to a legal rule, the other to exegesis; the former receives attention. One question is exegetical; the other homiletical; the former is taken up. One question is homiletical <italic>;</italic> the other appertains to an inference a <italic>fortiori;</italic> the latter is answered. One question refers to an <italic>a fortiori</italic> inference, the other to an inference from similarity of phrases; the former is dealt with. Questions are put by two person, one of whom is a graduated scholar, the other a disciple; attention is paid to the scholar. One of them is a disciple, the other is unlettered; heed is given to the disciple. Where both are graduated scholars, disciples or unlettered, and the questions of both concern two legal rules, or two responses, or two practical issues, the interpreter may in these cases give the preference to either.</p>
<p>9. No one should sleep in the Beth Hamidrash (House of Study). If a student dozes there, his knowledge becomes a thing of shreds. Thus Solomon, in his wisdom, said, &#x201C;And drowsiness shall clothe one in rags&#x201D; (Prov. 23:21). No conversation may be held in the House of Study, except in reference to the words of the Torah. Even if one sneezes there, the others do not wish him &#x2018;good health&#x2019;. Needless to add, other topics must not be discussed. The sanctity of a Beth Hamidrash is greater than that of synagogues.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>
<p>1. Just as a person is commanded to honour and revere his father, so is he under an obligation to honour and revere his teacher, even to a greater extent than his father; for his father gave him life in this world, while his teacher who instructs him in wisdom, secures for him life in the world to come. If he sees an article that his father had lost and another article that his teacher had lost, the teacher&#x2019;s property should be recovered first, and then the father&#x2019;s. If his father and his teacher are loaded with burdens, he should first relieve his teacher and then his father. If his father and teacher are in captivity, he should first ransom his father. But, if his father is a scholar, even though not of the same rank as his teacher, he should first recover his father&#x2019;s lost property and then his teacher&#x2019;s. There is no honour higher than that which is due to the teacher; no reverence profounder than that which should be paid him. The sages said &#x201C;Reverence for thy teacher shall be like the fear of Heaven&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:15). They further said, &#x201C;Whoever distrusts the authority of his teacher&#x2014;it is as if he disputes with the <italic>Shechinah</italic> &#x0021;; as it is said, &#x201C;When they strove against the Lord&#x201D; (Num. 26:9). Whoever starts a quarrel with his teacher, it is as if he started a quarrel with the <italic>Shechinah;</italic> as it is said, &#x201C;Where the children of Israel strove with the Lord, and He was sanctified in them&#x201D; (Num. 20:13). And whoever cherishes resentment against his teacher&#x2014;it is as if he cherishes resentment against the Lord, as it is said, &#x201C;Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord&#x201D; (Ex. 16:8). Whoever harbours doubts about his teacher&#x2014;it is as if he harbours doubts about the <italic>Shechinah;</italic> as it is said, &#x201C;And the people spoke against God and against Moses&#x201D; (Num. 21:3).</p>
<p>2. Who is to be regarded as disputing his teacher&#x2019;s authority ? One who sets up a college, holds sessions, discourses and instructs without his teacher&#x2019;s permission, during the latter&#x2019;s lifetime, and even if he be a resident in another country. To give decisions in his teacher&#x2019;s presence is forbidden at all times. Whoever gives a decision in his teacher&#x2019;s presence is deserving of death.</p>
<p>3. If there was a distance of twelve <italic>mils</italic><xref rid="fn114">&#x002A;</xref> between him and his teacher and a question was put to him concerning a rule of practice, he may give the answer; and, to save a man from doing what is forbidden, he may give a decision even in his teacher&#x2019;s presence. For instance, if he sees one committing a violation of the Law, because that person did not know that it is prohibited, or out of sheer wickedness, it is his duty to check the wrongdoer and say to him &#x201C;This is forbidden&#x201D;. He should do so, even in the presence of his master, and even if the latter has not given him permission. For to save God&#x2019;s name from being profaned, we forego the honour due to the teacher. This however is only permitted casually. But to assume the function of a decisionist and give decisions regularly to all enquirers, even if he and his teacher live at opposite ends of the earth, is forbidden to a disciple, during his teacher&#x2019;s lifetime, unless he has his teacher&#x2019;s permission. Nor even after his teacher&#x2019;s death, may any disciple regularly give decisions, unless he has attained a standard of knowledge qualifying him to do so.</p>
<p>4. A disciple who is not thus qualified and nevertheless gives decisions is &#x201C;wicked, foolish and of an arrogant spirit&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:9). And of him it is said, &#x201C;For she hath cast down many wounded&#x201D; (Prov. 7:26). On the other hand, a sage, who is qualified and refrains from rendering decisions, withholds knowledge of the Torah and puts stumbling blocks before the blind. Of him it is said &#x201C;Even the mighty are all her slain&#x201D; (Prov. 7:26). The students of small minds who have acquired an insufficient knowledge of the Torah, and yet seek to aggrandise themselves before the ignorant and among their townsmen by impertinently putting themselves forward and presuming to judge and render decisions in Israel&#x2014;these are the ones who multiply strife, devastate the world, quench the light of the Torah and spoil the vineyard of the Lord of hosts. Of such, Solomon, in his wisdom, said &#x201C;Seize for us the foxes, the little foxes that spoil the vineyard&#x201D; (Song of Songs 2:15).</p>
<p>5. A disciple is forbidden to call his teacher by his name, even when the latter is not present. This rule only applies if the name is unusual, so that any one hearing it knows who is meant. In his presence, the pupil must never mention his teacher&#x2019;s name, even if he desires to call another person who bears the same name; the same is the rule with his father&#x2019;s name. In referring to them even after their death, he should use a descriptive title, (&#x201C;my honoured father&#x201D;, or &#x201C;my honoured teacher&#x201D;). A disciple may not greet his teacher or return his greeting in the same manner as people are wont to greet their companions and return their greetings. But he should bow to his teacher and address him with reverence and deference &#x201C;Peace be unto thee, my teacher&#x201D;. If the teacher greeted him first, he should respond &#x201C;Peace to thee, my teacher and master&#x201D;.</p>
<p>6. So too, he should not remove his phylacteries in his teacher&#x2019;s presence, nor recline in his presence, but should sit respectfully, as one sits before a king. He should not recite his prayers, while standing in front of his teacher, or behind him, or at his side; needless to add, that he must not step (backward or forward) side by side with the teacher, but should stand at a distance in the rear, not however, exactly behind his teacher, and then he can offer up his devotions. He must not go with his teacher into the same bath room. He must not sit in his teacher&#x2019;s seat. When his teacher and a colleague dispute with one another, he must not, in his teacher&#x2019;s presence, interpose his opinion as to who is right. He must not contradict his teacher&#x2019;s statements. He may not sit down in his teacher&#x2019;s presence, till he is told &#x201C;be seated&#x201D;, nor stand up, till he is told to stand up, or till he obtains permission to stand up. And when he quits, he must not turn his back, but should retire with his face to his teacher.</p>
<p>7. It is his duty to rise before his teacher, from the moment he sees him at a distance, (and keep standing) till he disappears from view and is no longer visible; then the disciple may resume his seat. It is a person&#x2019;s duty to visit his teacher on the festivals.</p>
<p>8. Courtesy must not be shown to a pupil in the teacher&#x2019;s presence, unless the teacher himself is wont to show courtesy to that pupil. The various offices that a slave performs for his master, a pupil performs for his teacher. If however he is in a place where he is unknown, and has no phylacteries with him<xref rid="fn115">&#x002A;</xref>, and fears that people will say that he is a slave, he does not help his teacher to put on or remove his shoes. Whoever refuses his pupil&#x2019;s services, withholds kindness from him and removes from him the fear of Heaven<xref rid="fn116">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref>. A pupil who neglects any of the courtesies due to his master causes the <italic>Schechinah</italic> to depart from Israel.</p>
<p>9. If a pupil saw his teacher violating the ordinances of the Torah, he should say to him, &#x201C;Our master, thus and thus, hast thou taught us&#x201D;. Whenever a pupil recites a dictum in his teacher&#x2019;s presence, he should say &#x201C;Thus, our master, hast thou taught us&#x201D;. He should never quote a dictum that he has not heard from his teacher, without giving the authority for it. When his teacher dies, he rends all the garments he wears till he bares his breast. These rents he nver sews up. These rules only apply to the chief teacher from whom one has learnt most of what he knows. But his relation to one from whom he did not acquire most of his knowledge is that of a junior to a senior fellow-student. Towards such a senior student (who was at the same time his teacher), the disciple is not required to observe all the above-mentioned points of courtesy. But the junior has to stand up before him, and, on his demise, has to rend his garments, just as he does for a deceased relative for whom he mourns. Even if one learnt from a person one thing only, be it great or small, one has to stand up before that person and rend one&#x2019;s garments at his demise.</p>
<p>10. No scholar who possesses good manners will speak before his superior in knowledge, even if he has learnt nothing from him.</p>
<p>11. If one&#x2019;s chief teacher desires to excuse all his pupils or any one of them from all or any of these observances, he may do so. But even then, the disciple must show courtesy to him, even at the moment when he explicitly dispenses with it.</p>
<p>12. As pupils are bound to honour their teacher, so a teacher ought to show courtesy and friendliness to his pupils. The sages said &#x201C;Let the honour of thy disciples be as dear to thee as thine own&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 4:15). A man should take an interest in his pupils and love them, for they are his spiritual children who will bring him happiness in this world and in the world hereafter.</p>
<p>13. Disciples increase the teacher&#x2019;s wisdom and broaden his mind. The sages said, &#x201C;Much wisdom I learnt from my teachers, more from my colleagues; from my pupils, most of all&#x201D;. Even as a small piece of wood kindles a large log, so a pupil of small attainments sharpens the mind of his teacher, so that by his questions, he elicits glorious wisdom.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI.</h1>
<p>1. It is a duty to honour every scholar, even if he is not one&#x2019;s teacher, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face of the old man&#x201D; (Lev. 19.32). The word <italic>Zaken</italic> (rendered &#x201C;old man&#x201D; refers to one who has acquired wisdom. When ought people to rise up before him ? At the moment that he has approached within four cubits, (and they should keep standing) till he has passed out of sight.</p>
<p>2. This courtesy is not to be observed in a bath-house nor in a latrine, for it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt rise up and <italic>honour</italic>&#x201D; (Lev. 19:32); the courtesy of rising must be such as to express honour. Labourers, at the time when they are working, need not rise up before scholars, as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt rise up and honour&#x201D;; even as the &#x201C;honouring&#x201D; enjoined does not involve a monetary loss, so the courtesy of rising before the scholar is only required when it does not involve a monetary loss. And whence do we know that one should not shut one&#x2019;s eyes when a scholar passes, so as not to see him and thus evade the obligation of standing up before him ? It is inferred from the text &#x201C;And thou shalt fear thy God&#x201D; (Lev. 19:32); wherever the fulfilment of a duty is left to the conscience, the exhortation is added &#x201C;Thou shalt fear thy God&#x201D;.</p>
<p>3. It is improper for a sage to put the people to inconvenience by deliberately passing before them, so that they should have to stand up before him. He should use a short route and endeavour to avoid notice so that they should not be troubled to stand up. The sages were wont to use circuitous and exterior paths, where they were not likely to meet those who might recognise them, so as not to trouble them.</p>
<p>4. The same rule applies to riding as to walking. As it is a duty to rise up before the sage when he walks, so this courtesy should be shown when he rides by.</p>
<p>5. Where three are walking on a road, the teacher should be in the middle, the senior (of his disciples) at his right, the junior on his left.</p>
<p>6. On seeing a <italic>Chacham</italic> (a sage or religious authority), one does not rise till he has approached within four cubits; and as soon as he has passed, one resumes one&#x2019;s seat. On seeing the <italic>Ab-beth-Din</italic> (head of a Court; in ancient times, Vice-President of the Great Synhedrion), one stands up as soon as he comes within sight, and does not sit down till he has passed on to a distance of four cubits beyond the observer. On seeing the <italic>Nasi,</italic> (the Patriarch of Palestine, in ancient times, President of the Great Synhedrion), one rises as soon as he is seen, and does not sit down till he is seated in his place or has passed out of sight. If the <italic>Nasi</italic> desires to dispense with the courtesy due to him, he may do so. When the <italic>Nasi</italic> enters an assembly, all present rise and do not sit down till he says to them &#x201C;sit&#x201D;. When the <italic>Ab-beth-Din</italic> enters, two rows are formed. Those forming these rows on either side stand up while he passes between them till he is seated in his place. The rest of the people remain seated in their places.</p>
<p>7. When a <italic>Chacham</italic> enters, each person stands up as he approaches him within four cubits, and then resumes his seat, and so does the next one till the <italic>Chacham</italic> has reached his place and is seated. Sons of sages and their disciples, when the public requires their services, make their way over the heads of the people, to reach their places. It is however not praiseworthy for the disciples of the sages to be the last to enter. If one needs to withdraw (from the room)&#x2014;when he returns, he goes back to his place. Young children, of sages who have enough intelligence to follow the discourse, face their father (when he is lecturing). If they are too young to understand, they face the people.</p>
<p>8. A pupil, in regular attendance, may only rise before his teacher in the morning and in the evening, so that the honour paid to the teacher shall not be more than that shown to God.</p>
<p>9. One rises up before an old man, advanced in years, even if he is not a sage. Even a learned man who is young rises up before an old man of advanced age. He is not obliged however to rise to his full height but need only raise himself sufficiently to indicate courtesy. Even a gentile who is aged should be shown courtesy in speech; and one should extend a hand to support him, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head&#x201D;, without qualification.</p>
<p>10. Scholars do not go out to take part with the rest of the community in building, digging or similar work for the state, so as not to lose the respect of the common people. Nor are they assessed for the cost of building the walls, repairing the gates, paying the watchmen&#x2019;s wages, etc., or making a gift to the king. Nor are they obliged to pay a tax, jointly or severally levied upon the inhabitants of a city, as it is said, &#x201C;Yea, though they hire<xref rid="fn117">&#x002A;</xref> among the nations, now will I gather them up, and they begin to be diminished by reason of the burden of kings and princes&#x201D; (Hos. 8:10). So too, if a scholar has goods for sale, he is to be given the opportunity of disposing of them first; and no one else in the market is to be permitted to sell, till the scholar has first sold his stock. Similarly, if he has a cause pending and he is standing among a large number of suitors, his cause is taken first, and (during the hearing) he is seated.</p>
<p>11. It is exceedingly iniquitous to contemn sages or hate them. Jerusalem was only destroyed when its scholars were treated with contumely, as it is said &#x201C;But they mocked the messengers of God and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets&#x201D; (II Chron. 36; 16); this means that they &#x201C;despised those who taught His words&#x201D;. So too, the text &#x201C;And if ye shall abhor My statutes (Lev. 26:15) means &#x201C;if ye abhor the teachers of My statutes&#x201D;. Whoever contemns the sages will have no portion in the world to come, and is included in the censure &#x201C;For the word of the Lord hath he despised&#x201D; (Num. 15:31).</p>
<p>12. Although one who contemns the sages forfeits his portion in the world to come, yet if witnesses came forward and testified that a certain individual reviled a sage, even if only in words, the offender has incurred the penalty of excommunication. The Court (if he is found guilty) publicly excommunicates him and also imposes upon him a fine of one <italic>litra</italic><xref rid="fn118">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> in gold, a penalty of uniform amount in all places, and this is given to the sage. Whoever reviles a <italic>Chacham</italic> in words, even after the latter&#x2019;s decease, is excommunicated by the Court, which lifts the ban after he repents. If the sage who has been reviled is living, the offender is only released with the concurrence of the person on whose account the ban had been imposed. To safeguard his honour, the <italic>Chacham</italic> may himself excommunicate a boor who treated him disrespectfully. For this, neither witnesses nor a previous warning are necessary. The ban is not removed till the offender has appeased the <italic>Chacham.</italic> If he died before this was done, three men constitute themselves a quorum and remove the ban. If the <italic>Chacham</italic> desires to forgive the offender, and does not excommunicate him, he is at liberty to do so.</p>
<p>13. When a teacher, to safeguard the honour due to him, excommunicated any person, it is the duty of all his disciples to treat that person as under the ban. But when a disciple excommunicated anyone, for his own honour&#x2019;s sake, the teacher is not bound to respect the ban, but the people must do so. Similarly, anyone whom the <italic>Nasi</italic> (Patriarch of Palestine) excommunicated is to be treated by all Israel as under the ban. But if all Israel excommunicated a person, the <italic>Nasi</italic> need not treat him as excommunicated. Whoever has been placed under a ban of excommunication in his own city, is to be so regarded in another city. But one, who has been placed under such a ban in another city than his own, is not under a ban in his own city.</p>
<p>14. The foregoing rules only apply to one who was excommunicated because he reviled scholars. But if one was excommunicated for other transgressions, the penalty for which is excommunication, even if the ban was pronounced by the humblest individual in Israel, the <italic>Nasi</italic> and all Israel are bound to respect it till the offender repents of the transgression for which he had been excommunicated and is released from the ban. There are twenty-four offences for which the ban is pronounced on an individual, irrespective of sex. The category is as follows:</p>
<p>1) Whoever reviles a <italic>Chacham,</italic> even after his decease; 2) Insults the messenger of a Court; 3) calls another person, a slave; 4) receives a citation from a Court to appear at its sessions, on a date fixed by the Court, and fails to attend; 5) slights any ordinance instituted by the Scribes, or, needless to add, any precept of the Torah; 6) whoever refuses to accept the decision of a Court, is placed under the ban of excommunication till judgment is satisfied; 7) whoever keeps on his premises anything noxious, such as a vicious dog or an unsafe ladder, is put under a ban till he removes the nuisance; 8) whoever sells any of his real property to an idolater, is excommunicated till he assumes liability for all injuries that may accrue from the idolater to his Israelite neighbour who owns adjacent property; 9) whoever testifies concerning an Israelite before the idolaters&#x2019; courts and the effect of his testimony is to force the Israelite to make a payment for which, he would not, according to Jewish Law, have been liable, is placed under a ban till he makes restitution; 10) a butcher, who is a <italic>Cohen</italic> (priest descended in the male line of Aaron), and who does not separate the portions of a slaughtered beast due to the priest and give them to another priest, is placed under a ban till he does so; 11) whoever violates the sanctity of the second days of the Festivals, notwithstanding that the observance of these days is due to custom; 12) whoever does manual labour on the Eve of Passover, after midday; 13) takes God&#x2019;s name in vain; or takes it with an oath, in matters of no importance; 14) causes the public to profane God&#x2019;s name; 15) causes the public to eat sacrifices outside the prescribed bounds; 16) calculates, outside of Palestine, the annual calendar, and appoints dates for the beginning of the month; 17) causes the blind to stumble; 18) keeps the public from fulfilling a religious duty; 19) a slaughterer who permits forbidden meat to leave his premises as fit for Jewish consumption; 20) or who has not examined his slaughtering knife in the presence of the <italic>Chacham</italic> (religious head of the community); 21) whoever deliberately practises priapism; 22) whoever divorces his wife and then enters into a partnership with her, or engages in other commercial transactions which bring them into close relations&#x2014;when they come into Court (i.e. when they come under the notice of the Court) they are placed under a ban; 23) a religious leader of evil repute; 24) whoever unjustly excommunicates one who has not incurred the ban.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>
<p>1. If a sage grown old in wisdom, a <italic>Nasi,</italic> or <italic>Ab-beth-Din,</italic> committed a grave offence, he is, under no circumstances, to be publicly excommunicated, unless he acted like Jeroboam, the son of Nebat and his confederates. But if he committed other sins less heinous, he is punished with stripes privately, as it is said &#x201C;Therefore shalt thou stumble in the day, and the prophet also shall stumble with thee in the night&#x201D; (Hosea 4:5); this means that even if he stumbled, conceal it as in the darkness of the night. And we also say to him &#x201C;Save your self-respect and stay at home&#x201D; (II Kings 14:6). So too, if any scholar rendered himself liable to excommunication, the Court is forbidden to act precipitately and hastily put him under the ban. The members of the Court should flee from such a procedure, and take no part in it. The saints among the sages gloried in the fact that they never sat in a quorum of judges, to excommunicate a scholar, though they might sit as judges in a court that sentenced a scholar to be punished with stripes, if he had incurred that penalty, and even if the sentence was for contumacy.</p>
<p>2. What is the form used for <italic>Niddui</italic> (the lighter ban of excommunication)? (The authority who excommunicates) says &#x201C;So-and-so (naming him) shall be under a ban&#x201D;. If the excommunication took place in the offender&#x2019;s presence, he says to him &#x201C;This person, (naming him) is under a ban. For <italic>Cherem</italic> (the severer excommunication), he says to him &#x201C;So-and-so (naming him) is under <italic>Cherem</italic> and accursed; he is under an imprecation with Oath and Ban&#x201D;.</p>
<p>3. How is the lighter or severer excommunication removed ? The authority says to the person excommunicated &#x201C;Thou art released; thou art forgiven&#x201D;. If the person is released in his absence, the formula is &#x201C;So-and-so (naming him) is released and forgiven&#x201D;.</p>
<p>4. How should a person under the milder ban conduct himself, and how should others conduct themselves towards him ? During the whole of the term for which he has been excommunicated, he is, like a mourner, forbidden to have his hair cut or to bathe. He is not counted in the quorum of three or ten, required for reciting the special introduction to the Grace after Meals. He is not included in the congregation of ten men for any function that requires that number. No one may sit down within four cubits of where he is. He may however teach and be taught. He may be hired and hire others. If he dies, while under the ban, the Court orders a stone to be put on his coffin, as much as to say that he is stoned because he is separated from the community. Needless to state that no funeral eulogy is delivered, and his bier is not followed.</p>
<p>5. One who is in <italic>Cherem</italic> (under the severer ban of excommunication) suffers the additional severities that he may neither instruct nor receive instruction, but he studies privately, so as not to forget what he had learnt. He may neither be hired nor may he hire others. No one engages in commercial transactions with him, except to a slight extent, as much as is sufficient to provide him with a livelihood.</p>
<p>6. If a person has been for thirty days under <italic>Niddui</italic> (the milder ban) and made no request to be released, the ban is imposed for a second term of thirty days. If this period also passed without his seeking to have the ban removed, he is placed under the severer ban.</p>
<p>7. How many persons are needed to remove the milder or severer ban ? Three, even if they are private individuals. A qualified scholar can by himself remove the lighter or graver ban. A disciple has the right to do so, even in the locality where his teacher resides.</p>
<p>8. If three persons pronounced a ban of excommunication and left the place, and the offender renounced the practice for which he had been excommunicated, three others may proceed to release him.</p>
<p>9. If one does not know who it was that imposed the ban upon him, he should go to the <italic>Nasi</italic> and he will release him from the ban.</p>
<p>10. A ban that is conditional, even if self-imposed, requires annulment. A scholar who excommunicated himself, may himself annul the ban, even when he had added to it the clause, &#x201C;According to the view of So-and-so&#x201D;, and even though the excommunication was for a transgression for which he had incurred that penalty.</p>
<p>11. A man who dreamt that he had been excommunicated, even if he knows who it was that had (in his dream) excommunicated him, requires ten men who study <italic>Halachoth</italic> (legal rules) to release him from the ban. If he does not find them, he must go as far as a <italic>Parsah</italic> (four <italic>mils</italic>) to seek them. If he fails to find ten men with these qualifications, ten men who study <italic>Mishna</italic> may release him. Failing these, he may be released by ten who can read Scripture. If such are not accessible, he may be released by ten men even if they are unable to read Scripture. If he cannot find ten men in his locality, three individuals may release him.</p>
<p>12. If the ban was imposed on a person in his presence, it can only be removed in his presence. If it was imposed in his absence, it may be removed in his presence or absence. No interval of time need elapse between the imposition of a ban and its annulment, but the pronouncement of a ban may be immediately followed by its removal if the individual under the ban reforms. The Court may, at its discretion, leave a man under the ban for many years, according to the extent of his wickedness. If the Court see fit straightway to impose upon a person the <italic>Cherem</italic> (severer ban), and the same ban on any one who eats or drinks with him or stays near him within the distance of four cubits, they may do so in order to punish the offender and build a fence round the Torah, so that sinners shall not break bounds. Although a  <italic>Chacham</italic> has the right to pronounce the ban to safeguard his honour, it is not creditable for a scholar to accustom himself to this procedure. He should rather close his ears to remarks of the illiterate and take no notice of them, as Solomon, in his wisdom, said &#x201C;Also pay not heed to all the words that are spoken&#x201D; (Eccles. 7:21). Such too, was the way of the ancient saints. They heard themselves reviled and made no reply. Yet more, they forgave the reviler and pardoned him. Great sages, glorying in their commendable practices, said that they never, for the sake of personal honour, imposed on any one the lighter or severer ban. This is the way of scholars, which it is right to follow. It however only applies to cases where one has been reviled in private. But a scholar, who has been treated with contumely or been reviled in public, may not forgive the wrong done to his honour. If he does so, he is punished, for this is contempt of the Torah. We should relentlessly pursue the matter, till the offender begs his pardon, after which he should be forgiven.</p>

<p>These precepts are expounded in the following chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>1. In the days of Enosh, the people fell into gross error, and the counsel of the wise men of the generation became foolish. Enosh himself was among those who erred. Their error was as follows: &#x201C;Since God&#x201D;, they said, &#x201C;created these stars and spheres to guide the world, set them on high and allotted unto them honour, and since they are ministers who minister before Him, they deserve to be praised and glorified, and honour should be rendered them; and it is the will of God, blessed be He, that men should aggrandise and honour those whom He aggrandised and honoured&#x2014;just as a king desires that respect should be shown to the officers who stand before Him, and thus honour is shown to the king.&#x201D; When this idea arose in their minds, they began to erect temples to the stars, offered up sacrifices to them, praised and glorified them in speech, and prostrated themselves before them&#x2014;their purpose, according to their perverse notions, being to obtain the Creator&#x2019;s favour. This was the root of idolatry, and this was what the idolaters, who knew its fundamentals, said. They did not however maintain that there was no God except the particular star (which was the object of their worship). Thus Jeremiah said &#x201C;Who would not fear thee, O king of nations ? For it befitteth Thee; for as much as among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdom, there is none like unto Thee. But in one thing they are brutish and foolish. The vanities by which they are instructed are but a stock&#x201D; (Jerem. 10:7-8). This means that all know that Thou alone art God; their error and folly consists in imagining that this vain worship is Thy desire.</p>
<p>2. In course of time, there arose among men false prophets who asserted that God had commanded and expressly told them, &#x201C;Worship that particular star, or worship all the stars. Offer up to it such and such sacrifices. Pour out to it such and such libations. Erect a temple to it. Make a figure of it, to which all the people&#x2014;the women, children, and the rest of the folk&#x2014;shall bow down&#x201D;. The false prophet pointed out to them the figure which he had invented out of his own mind, and asserted that it is the figure of that particular star, which had been shown him in his prophetic vision. And then, they began to make figures in temples, under the trees, on the mountain-tops and the hills. There they would assemble, bow down to the figures, and tell all the people that this particular figure conferred benefits and inflicted injuries, and that it was proper to worship and fear it. Their priests would say to them, &#x201C;Through this worship, shall ye increase and prosper. Do this, and do not do that&#x201D;. Other imposters then sprang up, who declared that the star, celestial sphere or angel, had communed with them, and said to them &#x201C;Worship me in such and such fashion&#x201D;, had taught them a definite ritual and said to them &#x201C;Do this, and do not do that&#x201D;. So gradually the custom spread throughout the world of worshipping figures with various modes of worship, such as offering up sacrifices to them, and bowing down to them. As time passed, the honoured and revered Name of God was forgotten by mankind, vanished from their lips and hearts, and was no longer known to them. All the common people and the women and children knew only the figure of wood and stone, and the temple edifice in which they had, from their childhood, been trained to prostrate themselves to the figure, worship it and swear by its name. Even their wise men, such as priests and men of similar standing, also fancied that there was no other god but the stars and spheres, for whose sake and in whose similitude these figures had been made. But The Creator of the Universe was known to none, and recognised by none, save a few solitary individuals, such as Enosh, Methuselah, Noah, Shem and Eber. The world moved on in this fashion, till that Pillar of the World, the Patriarch Abraham, was born. After he was weaned, while still an infant, his mind began to reflect. By day and by night he was thinking and wondering: &#x2018;How is it possible that this (celestial) sphere should continuously be guiding the world and have no one to guide it and cause it to turn round; for it cannot be that it turns round of itself&#x2019;. He had no teacher, no one to instruct him in aught. He was submerged, in Ur of the Chaldees, among silly idolaters. His father and mother and the entire population worshipped idols, and he worshipped with them. But his mind was busily working and reflecting till he had attained the way of truth, apprehended the correct line of thought and knew that there is One God, that He guides the celestial Sphere and created everything, and that among all that exist, there is no god beside Him. He realised that the whole world was in error, and that what had occasioned their error was that they worshipped the stars and the images, so that the truth perished from their minds. Abraham was forty years old when he recognised his Creator. Having attained this knowledge, he began to refute the inhabitants of Ur of the Chaldees, arguing with them and saying to them, &#x201C;The course you are following is not the way of truth&#x201D;. He broke the images and commenced to instruct the people that it was not right to serve any one but the God of the Universe, to Whom alone it was proper to bow down, offer up sacrifices and make libations, so that all human creatures might, in the future, know Him; and that it was proper to destroy and shatter all the images, so that the people might not err like these who thought that there was no god but these images. When he had prevailed over them with his arguments, the king (of the country) sought to slay him. He was miraculously saved, and emigrated to Haran. He then began to proclaim to the whole world with great power and to instruct the people that the entire Universe had but one Creator and that Him it was right to worship. He went from city to city and from kingdom to kingdom, calling and gathering together the inhabitants till he arrived in the land of Canaan. There too, he proclaimed his message, as it is said &#x201C;And he called there on the name of the Lord, God of the Universe&#x201D; (Gen. 21:33). When the people flocked to him and questioned him regarding his assertions, he would instruct each one according to his capacity till he had brought him to the way of truth, and thus thousands and tens of thousands joined him. These were the persons referred to in the phrase, &#x201C;men of the house of Abraham&#x201D;. He implanted in their hearts this great doctrine, composed books on it, and taught it to Isaac, his son. Isaac settled down, instructing and exhorting. He imparted the doctrine to Jacob and ordained him to teach it. He, too, settled down, taught and morally strengthened all who joined him. The patriarch Jacob instructed all his sons, set apart Levi, appointed him head (teacher) and placed him in a college to teach the way of God and keep the charge of Abraham. He charged his sons to appoint from the tribe of Levi, one instructor after another, in uninterrupted succession, so that the doctrine might never be forgotten. And so it went on with ever increasing vigour among Jacob&#x2019;s children and their adherents till they became a people that knew God. When the Israelites had stayed a long while in Egypt, they relapsed, learnt the practices of their neighbours, and, like them, worshipped idols, with the exception of the tribe of Levi, which steadfastly kept the charge of the Patriarch. This tribe of Levi never practised idolatry. The doctrine implanted by Abraham would, in a very short time, have been uprooted, and Jacob&#x2019;s descendants would have relapsed into the error and perversities universally prevalent. But because of God&#x2019;s love for us and because He kept the oath made to our ancestor Abraham, He appointed Moses to be our teacher and the teacher of all the prophets, and charged him with his mission. After Moses had begun to exercise his prophetic functions and Israel had been chosen by the Almighty as His heritage, he crowned them with precepts, and showed them the way to worship Him and how to deal with idolatry and with those who go astray after it.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. The essential principle in the precepts concerning idolatry is that we are not to worship any thing created&#x2014;neither angel, sphere, star, none of the four elements, nor whatever has been formed from them. Even if the worshipper is aware that the Eternal is God, and worships the created thing in the sense in which Enosh and his contemporaries did, he is an idolater. It is against this that the Torah warns us when it says &#x201C;And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and seest the sun&#x2026;. which the Lord, thy God hath alloted unto all the peoples&#x201D; (Deut. 4:19). This means that when your mind roams and you observe that the world is guided by these spheres and that God placed them in the world, as beings that live, endure permanently, and do not disintegrate, like all other things, you may say that it is proper to bow down to these spheres and worship them. Concerning this tendency, God commanded and said, &#x201C;Take heed lest your heart be deceived&#x201D; (Deut. 11:16); that is to say, do not be led astray by the fancies of your mind, to worship these beings as intermediaries between yourselves and the Creator.</p>
<p>2. Many volumes have been composed by idolaters on idolatry, dealing with its essential principle, rites and rules. The Holy One, blessed be He, has enjoined us not to read these books, nor to meditate upon idol-worship, nor upon anything appertaining to it. It is even forbidden to gaze upon the picture of an idolatrous figure, as it is said &#x201C;Turn ye not unto the idols&#x201D; (Lev. 19:4). In this connection it is further said &#x201C;And that thou inquirest not after their gods, saying &#x2018;How do these nations serve&#x2019;&#x201D; (Deut. 12:30). That means that you shall not enquire in regard to an idol, as to the mode of its worship, even if you are not worshipping it. For this would cause you to turn after it and do as the idolaters do, as the text continues &#x201C;Even so will I do likewise&#x201D; (Deut. 12:30).</p>
<p>3. All these prohibitions come under one category&#x2014;not to turn to idolatry. Whoever turns towards it, by an overt act, is punished with stripes. It is not only idolatry to which we must not turn in thought. We are likewise warned not to permit any thought to enter our minds, that might cause one to reject a fundamental principle of the Torah. We must not turn our minds to such a thought and thus be drawn after the imaginations of our hearts. For the mind is limited; not every mind is capable of attaining knowledge of the truth in its purity. If every man were to follow after the vagaries of his heart, the result would be universal ruin, ensuing from the limitations of the human intellect. How so ? Sometimes one will be drawn to idolatry. Sometimes he will waver in his mind concerning the Unity of God, as to whether He is One or He is not One. He will speculate on what is above (the visible universe), what below it, what existed before the Creation, what will exist after the world comes to an end. Sometimes he will muse concerning Prophecy, and say to himself &#x2018;Perhaps it is true, perhaps it is not&#x2019;. Sometimes he will harbour similar doubts concerning the Torah as to whether it is of divine origin, or not. And such a person, being ignorant of the logical principles which need to be applied in order to attain positive truth, will lapse into heresy. In this regard, the Torah exhorted us &#x201C;And that ye go not about after your heart nor after your eyes, after which ye use to go astray&#x201D; (Num. 15:39). This means &#x201C;You shall not allow yourselves to be drawn, each one after his own limited intelligence, and imagine that his mind is attaining truth.&#x201D; The sages thus explained the text quoted above (Num. 15:39); &#x201C;After your heart&#x201D; refers to heresy. &#x201C;After your eyes&#x201D; refers to lechery.&#x201D; Although the violation of this prohibition may result in forfeiture of life hereafter, it is not punished with stripes. This is in accordance with the principle that an infraction which does not involve a physical act does not render one liable to that penalty.</p>
<p>4. The precept relating to idolatry is equal in importance to all the other precepts put together, as it is said, &#x201C;And when ye shall err and not observe all these commandments&#x201D; (Num. 15:22). This text has traditionally been interpreted as alluding to idolatry; hence the inference that acceptance of idolatry is tantamount to repudiating the whole Torah, the prophets and everything that they were commanded, from Adam to the end of time, as it is said &#x201C;From the day that the Lord gave commandment and onward, throughout your generations&#x201D; (Num. 15:23). And whoever denies idolatry confesses his faith in the whole Torah, in all the prophets and all that the prophets were commanded, from Adam to the end of time. And this is the fundamental principle of all the commandments.</p>
<p>5. An Israelite who worshipped an idol is regarded as an idolater in all respects and not as an Israelite who committed a transgression, the penalty for which is death by stoning. A pervert to idolatry is regarded as having renounced the whole of the Torah. So too, the infidels in Israel are in no wise to be regarded as Israelites; as it is said, &#x201C;None that go unto her return, neither do they attain the paths of life&#x201D; (Prov. 2:19). Infidels are those who, in respect to the follies of which we have spoken, go after the fancies of their hearts, till at last they become transgressors of the fundamental precepts of the Torah, in a spirit of defiance and arrogance, asserting that there is nothing wrong in what they do. It is forbidden to hold converse with them or give them any reply, as it is said, &#x201C;And come not nigh the door of her house&#x201D; (Prov. 5:8). The mind of the infidel tends towards idolatry.</p>
<p>6. Whoever acknowledges that idolatry is true, even if he does not worship an idol, reviles and blasphemes the honoured and revered Name of God. The idolater and the blasphemer are in the same class, as it is said, &#x201C;But the soul that doeth aught with a high hand, whether he be home-born or a stranger, the same blasphemeth the Lord&#x201D; (Num. 15:30). Hence, the idolater is hanged, just as the blasphemer is hanged, both being previously stoned. I have accordingly included the law of the blasphemer among the laws of idolatry, since both the blasphemer and the idolater deny the fundamental principles of our religion.</p>
<p>7. The following are the rules concerning the blasphemer. The blasphemer does not incur the penalty of death by stoning till he has pronounced the proper Name of God which is written <italic>Aleph, Daleth Nun, Yod,</italic> and cursed it, invoking one of the names of the Deity that may not be erased, as it is said &#x201C;And he that blasphemeth the name of the Lord (shall be put to death) (Lev. 24:16). Blaspheming the Proper Name of God is punished by stoning; but one who blasphemes any of the attributive names of God, only violates a prohibition. One authority declares that the extreme penalty is incurred only when the Tetragrammaton (J.H.V.H.) is blasphemed. I am of the opinion that the blasphemer is stoned, who uses either of the Proper Names.</p>
<p>8. Whence is the prohibition of blasphemy derived ? From the text &#x201C;Thou shalt not revile God&#x201D; (Ex. 22:27). The witnesses are examined day after day, using allusive terms such as the phrase &#x201C;Let Jos&#x00E9; smite Jos&#x00E9;&#x201D;. When the trial is concluded, the Court is cleared and the senior witness is again questioned. The judges say to him &#x2018;declare what thou didst hear, explicitly&#x2019;. He makes the declaration. The judges rise and rend their garments; these rents are never sewn up. The second witness then says &#x2018;I heard the same as he did&#x2019;. If there were many witnesses, each of them has to declare, &#x2018;I heard the same as the previous witness&#x2019;.</p>
<p>9. If the blasphemer retracts the blasphemy, even immediately after it has been uttered, it is of no avail. One who blasphemed in the presence of witnesses is put to death by stoning. If one blasphemed the Name of God, invoking the name of an idol, zealots attack him and put him to death. If they have not slain him, and he appears before the Court, he is not stoned unless he has blasphemed, invoking one of the Proper Names of God.</p>
<p>10. Whoever hears the Name of God blasphemed&#x2014;even if it be one of the attributive Names&#x2014;must rend his garments, provided that he hears the blasphemy uttered by an Israelite. Whether he hears it directly from the blasphemer, himself, or hears it reported by one who heard it from the blasphemer, he has to rend his garments. But one who hears a blasphemy uttered by an idolater is not obliged to rend his garments. The reason why Eliakim and Shebna rent their garments (when they heard Rabshakeh blaspheming) (II Kings ch. 18), was because Rabshakeh was an apostate. All the witnesses and judges place their hands, one after another, upon the head of the blasphemer and say to him &#x2018;Thy blood be upon thy head, for thou hast brought it on thyself&#x2019;. Of all those, who are condemned to death by the Court, the blasphemer is the only one in whose case imposition of hands is required, as it is said, &#x201C;And let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head&#x201D; (Lev. 24:14).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. Whoever worships an idol of his own free will and wilfully, incurs the (divine) penalty of excision. If witnesses were present and there had been previous warning, he is stoned. If one worshipped an idol in error, he brings the prescribed sin-offering.</p>
<p>2. Several modes of worship were instituted by the idolaters for each image and figure. The mode of worship for one idol is not the same as that for another idol. For example, the worship of Peor consists in indecent exposure of the person before the idol; the worship of Mercury consists in casting stones towards the idol or removing stones from before it. Many modes of worship, similar to these, were instituted for other idols. Hence, he who exposes his person in worship of Mercury or casts a stone before Peor, does not incur the penalty for idolatry. He is only liable, if he worships an idol in accordance with its special ritual, as it is said, &#x201C;How do these nations serve their gods ? Even so will I do likewise&#x201D; (Deut. 12:30). The Court must therefore be acquainted with the diverse idolatrous rituals, for no Israelite, (charged with worshipping an idol), is stoned, unless the Court knows that he observed the ritual appropriate to that idol.</p>
<p>3. The prohibition of these and similar modes of worship is inferred from the text &#x201C;Nor serve them&#x201D; (Ex. 20:5). This refers to all modes of worship with the exception of bowing down, sacrificing, offering incense or libation. He who uses any of these modes in the worship of any idol is liable to the penalty for idolatry, even if such is not the mode of worship peculiar to the particular idol worshipped. For example, if one pours forth a libation to Peor, or sacrifices to Mercury, he is liable, as it is said &#x201C;He that sacrificeth unto the gods, save unto the Lord only, shall be utterly destroyed&#x201D; (Ex. 22:19). Since sacrifice is included in the modes of worship, why is it especially mentioned in this text? To indicate that even as sacrifice is a mode of worship appropriate to the service of God, and one who offers up sacrifices to another deity incurs the penalty of stoning, irrespective of whether sacrifice is or is not the special mode of worshipping that particular deity, so every mode of worship appropriate to the service of God, if used in the worship of an idol,&#x2014;whether that is or is not its special mode or worship&#x2014;renders the worshipper liable as an idolater. It is therefore said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not bow down to another god&#x201D; (Ex. 34:14), in order to render one who bows down to an idol liable, even if such an act is not its mode of worship. The same rule applies to the offering of incense or libation. Sprinkling (of blood) and Pouring out Libations are regarded as identical.</p>
<p>4. If one offers ordure to an idol, or makes a libation to it of a pot filled with urine, he is liable to the penalty for idolatry. One who slays a grasshopper (to an idol) is not liable, unless such is its mode of worship. Thus also, to slay a beast that is short of a limb (as a sacrifice to an idol), does not render the slayer liable unless this was its special mode of worship. If an idol is worshipped by means of a stick, one who broke a stick before it, is liable and the stick may not be used. But if one threw a stick before it, he is liable, but the stick is not inhibited from use. The reason for the distinction is that throwing a stick is not analogous to sprinkling blood; because the stick, after being thrown, is unimpaired, while the blood, after it had been sprinkled, has been dispersed. Whoever accepts any one of the various classes of idols as a god, incurs the penalty of stoning. Even if a man takes up a brick and addresses it thus: &#x2018;Thou art my god&#x2019;, or words of similar import, he is liable. And though he retracts immediately and adds &#x2018;This is not my god&#x2019;, his retraction is of no avail and he is stoned.</p>
<p>5. Whoever worships an idol in accordance with its special ritual, even if he does so contemptuously, is liable. For example, if one exposes his person before Peor, in order to show contempt for it, or casts a stone towards Mercury to show his contempt for it, he is liable&#x2014;these being the respective modes of worshipping those idols&#x2014;and he should accordingly bring a sacrifice in atonement for his error.</p>
<p>6. If one worships an idol, out of love, as for instance, if a particular image fills him with delight by its beautiful craftmanship, or, if one worships an idol, out of fear of it, because he apprehends that it might do him harm&#x2014;like the idolaters who imagine that the idol has power to benefit or injure&#x2014;he is liable to stoning, provided that he accepted it as a god. But if he worshipped it with the ritual peculiar to it, or with one of the four modes appropriate to the worship of God, and his motive is only love of the idol or fear of it, he is not liable. He who embraces an idol, kisses it, sweeps the ground or lays the dust in front of it, washes it, anoints it, clothes it, puts shoes on its feet, or performs similar offices of respect, violates a prohibition, for it is said, &#x201C;Nor serve them&#x201D; (Ex. 20:5). These acts come under the category of worship, but stripes are not inflicted for any of them, since they do not constitute worship explicitly. If any of these acts is a ritual peculiar to an idol, and one performs it with intent to worship, he is liable for idolatry.</p>
<p>7. If a thorn lodged in a person&#x2019;s foot while he was standing in front of an idol, he is not to bend down in order to remove it, because it would look as if he were bowing down to the idol. If coins, belonging to a person, had been scattered in front of it, he is not to bend down to pick them up, because it would look as if he were bowing down to the idol. But he is to sit down and then extract the thorn or pick up the coins.</p>
<p>8. Where there are figures in front of an idol, which discharge water, one may not place his mouth over the opening of any of them and drink, because it would look as if he were kissing an idol.</p>
<p>9. If one acquires an idol for himself, he is punished with stripes, even though he did not make it with his own hand and did not worship it, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image nor any manner of likeness&#x201D; (Ex. 20:4). So too, if one makes an idol with his hands for others, even if he makes it for an idolater, he is punished with stripes, as it is said, &#x201C;Nor make unto yourselves molten gods&#x201D; (Lev. 19:4). Hence, one who makes an idol with his own hand and for himself, is punished with stripes twice.</p>
<p>10. It is forbidden to make figures for purposes of ornament, even if they are not idolatrous, as it is said, &#x201C;Ye shall not make with Me gods of gold and silver&#x201D; (Ex. 20:23); that is to say, figures of gold and silver which only serve as ornaments; so that those likely to err shall not err and imagine that these figures serve idolatrous purposes. The prohibition of making ornamental figures only applies to representation of the human form. Hence, a figure of a human being must not be made in wood, clay or stone; provided that the figure is in high relief like sculptures and figures in palaces and the like places; and whoever makes such is punished with stripes. But if a figure is in bas-relief or painted, such as pictures on boards and tablets, or woven in tapestry&#x2014;it is permitted.</p>
<p>11. If a signet ring has a human figure on it, and the figure is in high-relief, it is forbidden to wear the ring, but it may be used as a seal. If the figure is in bas-relief, the ring may be worn but may not be used for sealing, because the impression it would make would be in high-relief. It is also forbidden to make figures of the sun, moon, stars, constellations, or angels, for it is said, &#x201C;Ye shall not make with Me&#x201D; (Ex. 20:20); that is, &#x2018;ye shall not make figures representing My ministers that minister before Me on high&#x2019;; and such figures may not be made even on tablets. Figures of quadrupeds and of other animals&#x2014;with the exception of Man,&#x2014;and of trees and plants, etc., may be made, even if the figures are in relief.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. Those who seduce a city of Israel to idolatry are put to death by stoning, even if they themselves did not worship an idol but only seduced the inhabitants of their city to do so. The seduced inhabitants are put to death by the sword, provided that they worshipped an idol or accepted it as a god. Whence is the prohibition of seduction to idolatry inferred ? From the text &#x201C;Neither let it be heard out of thy mouth (Ex. 23:13).</p>
<p>2. A city does not become a seduced city unless those who have led it astray belong to it and are of the same tribe as the rest of its inhabitants, as it is said, &#x201C;From the midst of thee, and they have drawn away the inhabitants of their city&#x201D; (Deut. 13:14); unless the seducers are two or more than two, as it is said &#x201C;Certain base <italic>fellows</italic> are gone out&#x2026;. and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city&#x201D; (ibid 13:14); and unless those seduced are the majority of its inhabitants and number from one hundred up to the majority of the tribe. But if the majority of a tribe has been led astray, they are judged individually, as it is said, &#x201C;the inhabitants of that city&#x201D; (Deut. 13:16), that is, not of a small village nor of a large capital. A population of less than a hundred forms a small village and the majority of a tribe constitutes a large capital. So too, if women or children have seduced it, or a single male adult has done so, or a minority only of its inhabitants have been led astray, or if they have gone astray of themselves, or the seducers came from outside&#x2014;in all these cases, the law of the seduced city is not applied to it; the inhabitants are regarded as individuals who have worshipped idolatry. Whoever has transgressed is put to death by stoning, while the transgressors&#x2019; property passes to their heirs, as in the case of other malefactors, executed by sentence of a judicial court.</p>
<p>3. A seduced city may only be tried by a Court of seventy-one judges, as it is said &#x201C;Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman who have done this evil thing unto thy gates&#x201D; (Deut. 17:5), which means that individual offenders are executed by the sentence of a court at the gate (Tribal court of twenty-three judges); but majorities of cities are only executed if tried and sentenced by the Supreme Court (Seventy-one judges).</p>
<p>4. None of the Cities of Refuge (Num. 35:10-15), can ever become a seduced city, as it is said, &#x201C;in one of thy cities&#x201D; (Deut. 13:13). Nor can Jerusalem be condemned as a seduced city, since it had never been assigned to (any of) the tribes. A frontier town is never condemned as a seduced city, so that idolaters might not invade the Holy Land of Israel and destroy it. One court cannot declare three cities, adjacent to each other, to be seduced cities. But it may so declare them if they are at a distance from each other.</p>
<p>5. A city is not declared a seduced city unless the seducers used the plural number and said to the inhabitants &#x2018;let us go and worship&#x2019;, &#x2018;let us go and sacrifice&#x2019;, &#x2018;let us go and pour out libations&#x2019;, &#x2018;let us go and bow down&#x2019;, or &#x2018;let us go and accept the idol as a god&#x2019;; and the people gave heed and worshipped it with its special ritual; or in one of the four modes appropriate to the worship of God, or accepted the idol as a god. In a city where all these conditions have not been fulfilled by it and its seducers, how are the inhabitants to be treated ? Those who have worshipped idols are to be warned separately, and after testimony has been given of their persisting in idolatry, they are put to death by stoning as individuals who worshipped idols. Their property passes to their heirs.</p>
<p>6. What is the procedure in the case of a seduced city, when it is in a condition to be declared a seduced city ? The Supreme Court sends a Commission, through whom it institutes an enquiry and inquisition, till the Judges are convinced on clear evidence that all or the greater part of that city&#x2019;s population have been led astray and relapsed into idolatry. Then they send to them two scholars to warn them and try to bring them back to the right path. If they repent, it is well. But if they persist in their folly, the Court charges all Israel to organise an expedition against them. They lay siege to, and wage war upon them till the city is taken by storm. After it has been taken, a large number of tribunals is set up to try the inhabitants. Any one against whom two witnesses come and testify that he worshipped idols, after having been warned, is set apart. If all who worshipped idols are found to be a minority of the inhabitants, they are stoned, and the rest are saved. If those who worshipped idols are found to be the majority, they are brought before the Supreme Court, where their trial is completed. All those who worshipped idols are put to death by decapitation. If it is found that all the inhabitants had worshipped idols, all human beings in the city, including women and children, are put to the sword. If a majority of the inhabitants had worshipped idols, the wives and children of the idolaters are slain with the sword. Whether the whole city or a majority of its inhabitants had been seduced, those who seduced them are put to death by stoning. All the property in the city is gathered into its broadway. If it has no broadway, a broadway is constructed for it. If its broadway is situated outside the city, an exterior wall is built, so as to enclose it within the city, as it is said, &#x201C;into the midst of the broad place thereof&#x201D; (Deut. 13:17). All living creatures in the city are slain and all other property, together with the district itself, is burnt. This destruction by fire is an affirmative precept, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof&#x201D; (Deut. 13:17).</p>
<p>7. Property belonging to the righteous men in the city, that is, those inhabitants who were not led astray with the majority, is burnt with the rest of the goods in the city; because they lived there, their property is destroyed. Whoever converts any portion of it, however small, to his use, is punished with the statutory (39) stripes; as it is said &#x201C;And there shall cleave naught of the devoted thing to thy hand&#x201D; (Deut. 13:18).</p>
<p>8. If the witnesses, on whose evidence a city has been declared a seduced city, are found to have given false testimony, one who has taken possession of any portion of its property acquires the right to the same, and may convert it to his use&#x2014;the reason being that the witnesses&#x2019; testimony was refuted.<xref rid="fn119">&#x002A;</xref> Why, however, did he acquire the right to the property ? The answer is that every owner of property in that city, immediately after conviction, divested himself of his ownership, by dereliction. The city is never rebuilt, and whoever rebuilds it, is punished with stripes, as it is said &#x201C;It shall not again be built&#x201D; (Deut. 13:17). But the site may be converted into gardens and parks, as it is said &#x201C;It shall not be built again&#x201D;&#x2014;which means that it may not be rebuilt as an inhabited district, such as it formerly had been.</p>
<p>9. When a caravan, travelling from place to place, passed through a city that had been seduced and was also seduced with it, the members of the caravan are put to death by decapitation and their property is destroyed&#x2014;provided that the caravan stayed in the city at least thirty days. Otherwise, they are put to death by stoning, and their property passes to their heirs.</p>
<p>10. Property belonging to residents in another district, but deposited in the seduced city&#x2014;even when responsibility for its safekeeping was assumed by citizens of the condemned city&#x2014;is not burnt but reverts to the owners, as it is said, &#x201C;The spoil thereof&#x201D; (Deut. 13:17)&#x2014;not the spoil of another district. Property owned by the wicked who were seduced, and which was deposited in another district, if it had been collected and placed with the property in the condemned city, is burnt with it. Otherwise it is not destroyed but passes to the heirs.</p>
<p>11. A beast, half interest in which belongs to a seduced city (or a resident in it), while the other half is the property of another city, if found in the seduced city, may not be converted to private use. A mass of dough, similarly owned, may be used, because it is capable of partition.</p>
<p>12. A beast owned by a seduced city, even after it had been ritually slaughtered, may not be converted to private use, as is the rule with an ox condemned to be stoned (Ex. 21:28-32) that had been ritually slaughtered. Natural hair of the men or women of the seduced city may be used. But the hair of a wig found there, comes within the category of &#x201C;the spoil thereof&#x201D; and may not be used.</p>
<p>13. Fruits (of the field or orchard), not yet severed and found in the seduced city, may be enjoyed, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt gather&#x2026;. and shalt burn&#x201D; (Deut. 13:17). The text refers to that which only needs to be gathered and burnt, but not to fruits still attached (to the soil or tree), for these must be severed before they can be gathered and burnt. The same principle applies to the hair of the head, and, needless to add, to trees which are permitted to be used and become the property of the heirs. In regard to sanctified property, cattle set apart to be sacrificed on the altar are suffered to die a natural death, for &#x201C;the sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination&#x201D; (Prov. 21:27). If they had been contributed to defray the cost of repairing the sacred edifice, they are to be redeemed, and then are burnt, as it is said &#x201C;The spoil thereof&#x201D; (Deut. 13:17), but not the possessions of God.</p>
<p>14. The first born (of cattle) and the tithe of cattle found in the city, if without blemish, are treated like sacrifices for the altar, and suffered to die. If blemished, they are treated like the ordinary cattle of the city and are slain. Heave-offerings (Num. 18:11), found in it, which have passed into the possession of a priest, are to be left to rot, being his property. If they are still in the possession of the Israelite (owner of the produce) they should be given to a priest resident in another district, for they are God&#x2019;s property and intrinsically sacred.</p>
<p>15. The Second Tithe (Deut. 14:22-23) and the money into which it has been converted (ibid. 14:24-26), and likewise sacred scriptures, found in a seduced city, must be put away in a place of concealment.</p>
<p>16. Whoever executes judgment on a seduced city performs a meritorious act, as much as one who offers up a burnt offering that is wholly consumed, as it is said, &#x201C;Every whit unto the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 13:18). Yea more, he averts fierce wrath from Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;that the Lord may turn from the fierceness of his anger&#x201D; (ibid. 13:18); and brings blessing and mercy upon Israelites, as it is said &#x201C;And show thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and multiply thee&#x201D; (ibid. 13:18).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>
<p>1. He who entices an Israelite man or woman to idolatry is stoned, even though neither the enticer nor the enticed worshipped an idol, but because he gave instruction to worship an idol. And whether the enticer was a layman or a prophet, or whether only one person&#x2014;male or female&#x2014;was enticed or a number of persons were enticed, the punishment is death by stoning.</p>
<p>2. He who entices the majority of the inhabitants of a city to idolatry is a seducer and is not styled an enticer. If the seducer of the majority of a city was a prophet, he is put to death by stoning, and those who were seduced are dealt with individually and not as inhabitants of a seduced city, unless there were at least two seducers. Whether one says &#x201C;The idol said to me &#x2018;worship ye it&#x2019; &#x201D; or says &#x201C;the Holy One, blessed be He, said to me &#x2018;worship ye the idol&#x2019; &#x201D;, in either case, he is regarded as a prophet who seduced. And if the majority of the inhabitants of a city went astray after him, he is put to death by stoning. The enticer, whether he used the plural or singular number, is put to death by stoning. For instance, if one says to another, &#x201C;I will worship an idol&#x201D;; &#x201C;I will go and worship&#x201D;; let us go and worship with the ritual especially used for that particular idol&#x201D;; &#x201C;I will sacrifice&#x201D;; &#x201C;I will go and sacrifice&#x201D;; &#x201C;let us go and sacrifice&#x201D;; &#x201C;I will burn incense&#x201D;; &#x201C;I will go and burn incense&#x201D;; &#x201C;let us go and prostrate ourselves&#x201D;;&#x2014;in uttering any of these phrases, he is an enticer. If he enticed two persons, they act as the witnesses. They bring him to the Court and testify concerning him that he had so spoken to them, and he is put to death by stoning.</p>
<p>3. For the conviction of an enticer, no previous warning is required. If he spoke to a single individual, that person should reply &#x201C;I have friends who desire this&#x201D;. And it should be so contrived that the enticer shall make his attempt at seduction before two witnesses, which is necessary to secure his condemnation to death. If the enticer will not consent to entice two persons, it is a duty to secure the evidence of concealed witnesses. In no other class of capital offences but this, is recourse had to this method. What is the procedure ? The one whom he attempted to entice, brings two men, and stations them in a dark place where they can see the enticer and hear his words, while the enticer cannot see them. He then says to the enticer, &#x201C;Say again what you said to me privately&#x201D;. After the enticer has done so, the one whom he sought to entice replies, &#x201C;How can we give up our God who is in Heaven, and go and and worship blocks of wood and stones ?&#x201D; If the enticer retracts or keeps silent, he is not liable. But if he says &#x201C;This is our duty, and this, it is right for us to do&#x201D;, then those who stood at a distance bring him to the Court and he is put to death by stoning.</p>
<p>4. The execution of the enticer devolves upon the one he attempted to entice, as it is said, &#x201C;Thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death&#x201D; (Deut. 13:10). The latter is forbidden to love the enticer, as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt not consent unto him&#x201D; (Deut. 13:9). Since, in reference to an enemy, it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt surely release it with him&#x201D; (Ex. 23:5), it might be supposed that this person (the enticer) should also be helped. It is therefore said &#x201C;Nor hearken unto him&#x201D; (Ibid. 13:9). Since it is said, &#x201C;Neither shalt thou stand idly by the blood of thy neighbour&#x201D; (Lev. 19:16), it might be supposed that you are not to stand idly by the blood of this man. It is therefore said &#x201C;Neither shall thine eye pity him&#x201D; (Deut. 13:9). The enticed must not seek to exculpate the enticer, as it is said &#x201C;Neither shalt thou spare&#x201D; (Deut. 13:9). And if he is aware of a ground for the enticer&#x2019;s condemnation, he must not refrain from declaring it, as it is said, &#x201C;Neither shalt thou conceal him&#x201D; (ibid. 13:9). Whence is the prohibition inferred, forbidding a layman to entice to idolatry ? From the text &#x201C;And all Israel shall hear and fear&#x201D;<xref rid="fn120">&#x002A;</xref> (Deut. 13:12).</p>
<p>5. If one enticed others to worship him, and said to them &#x201C;worship me&#x201D;, and they worshipped him, he is stoned; but he is not stoned if they did not worship him, even though they accepted his statement and said &#x201C;yes&#x201D;.<xref rid="fn121">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> But if he enticed people to the worship of another person or to any other form of idolatry, and the one he addressed accepted his teaching and said &#x201C;yes, let us go and worship&#x201D;, even though the latter did not yet carry out his intention, both the enticer and the enticed are stoned, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not consent unto him nor hearken unto him&#x201D; (Deut. 13:9), implying that one who does consent and hearken is liable to punishment.</p>
<p>6. What is meant by a prophet who prophesies in the name of idolatry ? He is one who asserts &#x201C;This particular idol or particular star told me that it is a duty to do this and this or not to do it&#x2019;. Even if his statement coincided with the law, so that he declared unclean that which is actually unclean and pronounced clean that which is clean, he is put to death by strangling, provided that he had been warned in the presence of two witnesses, as it is said, &#x201C;or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die&#x201D; (Deut. 18:20). The prohibition is implied in the text &#x201C;And make no mention of the name of other gods&#x201D; (Ex. 23:13).</p>
<p>7. It is forbidden to engage in a controversy with, or refutation of, one who prophesies in the name of idolatry. Nor is he asked for a sign or token. Should he, on his own initiative, perform such a sign, we pay no heed to it nor reflect upon it. Whoever gives consideration to such signs, (thinking) that possibly they are true, violates a prohibition, as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt not hearken to the words of that prophet&#x201D; (Deut. 13:4). A false prophet is put to death by strangling, even though he prophesied in the name of the Lord, and neither added to, nor took aught away from His commandments, as it is said, &#x201C;But the prophet that shall speak a word presumptuously in My name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die&#x201D; (Deut. 18:20).</p>
<p>8. Whether one prophesies what he has not received in a prophetic vision, or, having heard the words of another prophet, declares that the message was directly communicated to himself&#x2014;in either case, he is a false prophet and is put to death by strangling.</p>
<p>9. Whoever refrains from slaying a false prophet because of his high standing, his mode of life being consistent with the prophetic calling, violates a prohibition, as it is said, &#x201C;the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously; thou shalt not be afraid of him&#x201D; (Deut. 18:22). Likewise, whoever refrains from declaring grounds for his condemnation, or stands in fear and awe of his words, is included among those who transgress the prohibition &#x201C;Thou shalt not be afraid of him&#x201D; (Deut. 18.22). The false prophet may only be tried by the Court of seventy-one judges.</p>
<p>10. He who makes a vow in the name of an idol or swears by it, is punished with stripes, as it is said, &#x201C;And make no mention of the name of other gods&#x201D; (Ex. 23:13); and this is so, irrespective of whether he swore by it for himself<xref rid="fn122">&#x002A;</xref> or for an idolater<xref rid="fn123">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref>. It is also forbidden to cause an idolater to take an oath by his object of worship. The mention of the name of an idol, not by way of oath, is also forbidden, as it is said, &#x201C;Make no mention&#x201D; (Ex. 23:13).</p>
<p>11. A person should not say to another &#x201C;wait for me beside that idol&#x201D;, or give a similar direction. The names however of any idol mentioned in the Scriptures may be uttered, such as Peor, Bel, Nebo, Gad, etc. It is forbidden to give others an occasion to make vows or confirm them in the name of an idol. That person only is punished with stripes who himself makes or confirms a vow in the name of an idol, that is, swears by its name.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI.</h1>
<p>1. One who practises communion with ghosts or familiar spirits of his own free will and presumptuously, incurs the penalty of excision. And if witnesses were present and a warning had been previously given, he is put to death by stoning. If the offence had been committed unwittingly, he brings the appointed sin-offering. How is communing with ghosts practised ? The practitioner stands up, offers a certain kind of incense, holds in his hand a myrtle twig, and waves it. He pronounces softly certain words known to the practitioners of this art, till the one who consults him fancies that someone is conversing with him, and answering his questions in words that sound as if they came from beneath the ground in exceedingly low tones almost inaudible to the ear and only apprehended by the mind. Or he takes a dead man&#x2019;s skull, burns incense to it and uses arts of divination till one hears a sound as if a voice, exceedingly low, came from under his armpit and replied to him&#x2014;all acts of such nature constitute communion with ghosts. Whoever does any of these things is put to death by stoning.</p>
<p>2. How is communion with spirits practised ? The practitioner puts the bone of a bird called <italic>Yadua</italic> into his mouth, offers up incense and performs other acts till he falls down like an epileptic and utters predictions of future events. All these are species of idolatry. Whence is it inferred that they are prohibited ? From the text &#x201C;Turn ye not unto the ghosts nor unto familiar spirits&#x201D; (Lev. 19:31).</p>
<p>3. He who, of his own free will and presumptuously, offers any of his offspring to Molech, incurs the penalty of excision. If he does so unwittingly, he brings the appointed sin-offering. If the offence was committed in the presence of witnesses and after warning, he is put to death by stoning, as it is said &#x201C;Whosoever&#x2026;. that giveth of his seed unto Molech shall surely be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones&#x201D; (Lev. 20:2). Whence is it inferred that this is prohibited ? From the text &#x201C;And thou shalt not give any of thy seed to make pass to Molech&#x201D; (Lev. 18:21), and it is further said, &#x201C;There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter pass through the fire&#x201D; (Deut. 18:10). What is the procedure ? A great fire is kindled. The father takes anyone of his offspring and delivers him to the priests who are fire worshippers. Those priests give back the son to the father, after he had been delivered into their hands, that he may be passed through the fire with his father&#x2019;s consent. The father it is who passes his son over the fire with the priest&#x2019;s permission. He makes his son walk through the flames on his feet, from one side to the other. Not that he burns the child in honour of Molech, as sons and daughters were burnt in the worship of another species of idolatry, but merely passing (the child) through the fire constituted the service of the idol called Molech. Therefore, he who performs this ritual to an idol other than Molech, is not liable.</p>
<p>4. The penalty of excision or stoning is not incurred unless the father delivers his son to Molech and makes him pass through the fire on his feet, leading him through. If he delivered him to Molech but did not make him pass through the fire, or if he made him pass without having delivered him to Molech, or if he delivered him to Molech and made him pass through the fire but did not lead him through, he is not liable. Nor is he liable unless he delivers some of his offspring only and leaves the others, as it is said, &#x201C;Because he hath given of his seed to Molech&#x201D;; &#x201C;of his seed&#x201D;, but not all his seed.</p>
<p>5. One is liable for leading any of his descendants through the fire to Molech, whether they are legitimate or illegitimate, whether sons or daughters, their children or grand-children, or any descendants&#x2014;all these being included in one&#x2019;s offspring. But if he led his brothers, sisters, ancestors, or himself, through the fire to Molech, he is not liable; or if he led his offspring, while asleep or blind, he is not liable.</p>
<p>6. The pillar, which the Torah forbids is a structure at which all gather, even if the purpose is to worship God, for such was the custom of the idolaters; as it is said, &#x201C;Neither shalt thou set thee up a pillar&#x201D; (Deut. 16:22). Whoever sets up such a pillar, is punished with stripes. So too, in regard to the &#x201C;figured stone&#x201D; mentioned in the Torah&#x2014;any one who prostrates himself on it, even to worship the Lord, is punished with stripes, as it is said &#x201C;Neither shall ye place a figured stone in your land to bow down yourselves upon it&#x201D; (Lev. 26:1)&#x2014;it having been the custom of idolaters to place a stone before an idol that the worshipers might prostrate themselves upon it. We may not do the like unto the Lord. One is however not punished with stripes unless he spreads out his hands and feet on the stone so that he lies completely stretched out across it. This is the prostration mentioned in the Torah.</p>
<p>7. This rule applies to all territories except the Temple, where it is permitted to prostrate oneself on the stones, as it is said, &#x201C;in your land&#x201D; (Deut. 26:1), which means that in your land you may not prostrate yourself, but you may do so on the cut stones in the Temple. Hence, all Israelites have the custom to spread mats, or any kind of straw or stubble over the stone floors of synagogues, to serve as a partition between their faces and the stones. If a worshipper was unable to procure anything which would separate him from the stone, he should go elsewhere to prostrate himself, or turn on his side and incline, so that his face will not touch the stone.</p>
<p>8. Whoever prostrates himself to God on cut stones without extending his hands and feet is not punished with the statutory stripes (for violating a scriptural prohibition) but receives stripes for contumacy. If however he prostrates himself to an idol, whether with hands and feet extended or not, he incurs the penalty of death by stoning, as soon as he put his face to the ground.</p>
<p>9. He who plants a tree near the Altar or in any part of the Temple Court, whether the tree belongs to a species that does not bear fruit or is one that produces edible fruit, and even if he had planted it to adorn the Temple and enhance its beauty, is punished with stripes, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not plant thee an <italic>Asherah</italic> of any tree near unto the altar of the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 16:21). The reason for the prohibition is that it had been the custom of idolaters to plant trees by the side of an idolatrous altar, so that people might assemble there.</p>
<p>10. It is forbidden to erect wooden colonnades within the Temple, like those in courtyards, although they are built structures and not planted trees. The prohibition is an extreme precaution grounded on the terms of the phrase &#x201C;any wood&#x201D; (Deut. 16-21). All the colonnades and cornices projecting from the Temple walls were of stone and not of wood.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>
<p>1. An affirmative precept enjoins the destruction of any idol, articles subsidiary to its worship, and everything made for its sake, as it is said, &#x201C;Ye shall surely destroy all the places (wherein the nations that ye are to dispossess served their gods) (Deut. 12:2); and it is further said &#x201C;but thus shall ye deal with them, (ye shall break down their altars&#x201D;) (ibid. 7:5). In the land of Israel, it is a duty actively to pursue idolatry till we have exterminated it from the whole of our country. Outside the Holy Land, however, we are not so commanded; but only that whenever we acquire any territory by conquest, we should destroy all the idols found there, as it is said, &#x201C;And ye shall destroy their name out of that place&#x201D; (Deut. 12:3); that is, in the Land of Israel, thou art enjoined actively to pursue them but not outside the Holy Land.</p>
<p>2. An idol, articles subsidiary to its worship, sacrifices offered to it, and anything made for its sake, are forbidden to be used, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house&#x201D; (ibid. 7:26). Whoever makes use of any of these things is punished with stripes twice; once, for violating the prohibition &#x201C;thou shalt not bring etc.&#x201D; (ibid. 7:26), and once, for violating the prohibition &#x201C;and there shall cleave naught of the devoted thing to thy hand&#x201D; (ibid. 13:18).</p>
<p>3. No use may be made of a beast that has been wholly offered up to an idol. This prohibition applies to its dung, bones, horns, hoofs and hide, and every part of it. Hence, if a mark on the hide indicates that it came off a beast that had been offered up to an idol&#x2014;as, for example, a circular perforation which idolaters used to make over the heart, through which that organ was extracted&#x2014;all the hides with this characteristic are forbidden to be used. And so with all similar indications.</p>
<p>4. What are the distinctions between an idol belonging to an idolater and one belonging to an Israelite ? An idol belonging to an idolater is forthwith prohibited to be used: as it is said, &#x201C;the graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire&#x201D; (Deut. 7:25); as soon as it has been made, it becomes his god. But an idol, the property of an Israelite, is not prohibited till it has been worshipped, as it is said, &#x201C;and setteth it up in secret,&#x201D; (Deut. 27:15); that is, performs mysterious rites that constitute its mode of worship. Articles used in idolatrous worship, whether belonging to an idolater or to an Israelite, only become forbidden after they have been so used.</p>
<p>5. Whoever makes an idol for others, although he is punished with stripes, is nevertheless permitted to use the remuneration for his labour&#x2014;and this is so, even if he made the idol for an idolater, in which case it becomes forthwith prohibited. The reason is that an idol does not become forbidden till it is completed; and the last tap of the hammer is worth less than a <italic>perutah</italic> (the smallest coin). If one purchased broken metal from an idolater and found an idol among the pieces&#x2014;even if the purchaser had already paid the price, provided that he has not yet taken possession of the article&#x2014;he returns it to the idolater. The same is the rule if he had taken possession but had not paid the price; for, although taking possession affects transfer of property from a gentile, the case here is analogous to a purchase under error. If, however, he had paid the price and also taken possession, he should cast the idol into the Dead Sea. So where an idolater and a proselyte inherited the property of their father who had been an idolater, the proselyte may say to the idolater: &#x201C;Do thou take the idol and I will take money; do thou take the prohibited wine and I will take fruit.&#x201D; Once, however, these (prohibited articles) have come into the proselyte&#x2019;s possession, they are forbidden to be used.</p>
<p>6. Figures made by gentiles as ornaments are permitted to be used, but those which they made for worship are forbidden. For example, all figures found in villages are forbidden, on the presumption that they were made for worship. But as for those in a city, if they are placed at the city gates, and the hand of the figure holds the form of a staff, bird, globe, sword, crown or ring, the presumption is that such a figure was erected for worship, and its use is forbidden. Otherwise, the figure is presumed to be ornamental and its use is permitted.</p>
<p>7. Images, found discarded in the streets or among broken metal, may be used; needless to add, this is the rule also in the case of fragments. But if one finds a hand of an idol or its foot or any of its limbs, discarded, it is forbidden to be used. For as it is known for certain that the limb was part of a figure that had been worshipped, its prohibited status continues till one is sure that the gentiles annulled it as an object of worship.</p>
<p>8. If one finds articles bearing the figure of the sun, moon, or dragon, whether they are gold or silver vessels or robes of scarlet embroidered with any such figure, or earrings or finger rings so engraved, they are forbidden to be used. Other articles with these figures are permitted, the presumption being that the figures are ornamental. Other figures than those enumerated, on any vessels, are presumed to be ornamental, and the vessels may be used.</p>
<p>9. An idol, anything subsidiary to its service, or anything offered to it, however small, inhibits the use of objects with which it had become so completely mixed up that its identity is lost. For example, if an idol became mixed up with ornamental figures, even if it be but one idol among many thousands of such figures, all have to be destroyed<xref rid="fn124">&#x002A;</xref>. So, if a cup used in idolatry had become mixed up with a large number of cups, or a piece of meat of an idolatrous sacrifice has become mixed up with several pieces of other meat, they must all be destroyed.<xref rid="fn124">&#x002A;</xref> So too, if a hide that had been perforated over the heart, had been mixed up with many hides (and cannot be identified), all the hides are forbidden. If one transgressed and sold an idol or any of its utensils, or anything offered to it, the monetary proceeds received are forbidden to be used; and, as in the case of the idol itself, any portion of those proceeds, however small it is, renders all monies with which it is mixed up, likewise forbidden; as it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house and be accursed like unto it&#x201D; (Deut. 7:26). Whatever thou obtainest from an idol, or from its utensils or from its offerings is forbidden like the idol itself.</p>
<p>10. When an idol or an idolatrous tree has been burnt, its ashes are forbidden to be used. The live ember of an idol is forbidden, but the flame may be used, because it is without substance. Where it is doubtful whether an object is idolatrous, it may not be used. But where there is a double doubt,<xref rid="fn125">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> it may be used. For example, a cup used in idolatrous worship was inadvertently dropped into a store full of cups (and cannot be identified);&#x2014;all the cups are forbidden to be used, on the principle that an idol or any one of its subsidiary articles, however small, renders everything with which it has become mixed up, forbidden. But if one of these cups was afterwards removed and became mixed up with two other cups, all three are permitted. If a ring belonging to an idol became mixed up with several rings, and two of these fell into the ocean, all the rest are permitted to be used, on the assumption that the idolatrous ring was one of the two that were lost. If it was mixed up with one hundred rings which were subsequently divided into two lots&#x2014;forty in one, sixty in the other&#x2014;and the forty accidentally became mixed up with other rings, all in this lot are permitted to be used&#x2014;it being assumed that the idolatrous ring was in the larger original lot. If the sixty rings became mixed up with other rings, all are prohibited.</p>
<p>11. Whether an idolatrous tree was itself worshipped or an idol was placed beneath it&#x2014;in either case it is forbidden to sit in the shadow cast by its trunk. It is however, permitted to sit in the shadow of its twigs and leaves. If there is another way by which to travel, one must not pass under such a tree. But if there is no other way, one may pass beneath it, running.</p>
<p>12. Young birds that nest on an idolatrous tree and no longer need the mother-bird&#x2019;s care are permitted to be taken for use. But eggs as well as unfledged birds that still need the mother-bird, are forbidden to be taken and used, because the idolatrous tree is, as it were their &#x201C;base&#x201D;. The nest itself, situated on the tree top, is permitted, because the bird has brought its constituents from elsewhere.</p>
<p>13. If one took wood from such a tree, it may not be used. An oven heated with such wood must be allowed to get cold. Then it should be heated with other wood that is lawful, after which, bread may be baked in it. Bread baked in it before it had cooled, may not be used. If it became mixed up with other loaves, the price of the forbidden bread must be cast into the sea, so that one does not enjoy any of it, while the loaves are permitted to be used.</p>
<p>14. If a weaver&#x2019;s shuttle had been made from the wood of an idolatrous tree, cloth woven on that shuttle is forbidden to be used. If such cloth became mixed up with other pieces of cloth, its price is to be cast into the sea and all the pieces of cloth may be used. Vegetables may be planted beneath an idolatrous tree, whether in summer, when they need shade, or in the rainy season; the reason being that both the forbidden shade of the idolatrous tree, and the soil which has not become forbidden, cause the vegetables to grow, and a product of two factors, of which one is forbidden while the other is permitted, is always permitted. Accordingly, a field fertilised with manure belonging to an idol, may be sown. A cow, fattened with vetches belonging to an idol, may be used for food. And so, in similar cases.</p>
<p>15. Meat, wine or fruit, set aside to be offered up to an idol, does not become forbidden, even after having been brought into the idolatrous temple, till it has been actually presented to the idol. Once this has been done, it is regarded as an idolatrous offering; and even if it is again taken out, it remains for ever forbidden. Any thing found in an idolatrous temple, even water or salt, is, by scriptural enactment, forbidden to be used, and one who partakes of it, in the minutest quantity, is punished with stripes.</p>
<p>16. A garment, utensils or coins on the hand of an idol, if found in a position betokening contempt, may be used; if the position indicates respect, they are forbidden to be used. For instance, a purse found suspended about its neck, a garment folded and lying upon its head or a vessel leaning over its head, may be used, because the position indicates contempt, and so in similar cases. If the article found on its head is such that the like of it is offered up on the altar, it is forbidden to be used. These distinctions only apply to things found outside the place of worship. But if one found any such thing within an idolatrous place of worship, whether in a position indicating respect or contempt, whether it is suitable to be offered up on the altar or not&#x2014;in short, whatever is found within such a place, even if it be only water or salt, is forbidden to be used. In the case of Peor and Mercury, anything found with them, within or without their respective places of worship, is forbidden to be used. This too is the rule with regard to the stones of Mercury; a stone that evidently belongs to it is forbidden to be used.</p>
<p>17. A bath or a garden belonging to an idol may be used, if no gratuity need be given, but may not be so used, if such has to be given. If it is the joint property of the idol and others, it may be used, even if a gratuity has to be given to the priests, provided that no fee is paid.</p>
<p>18. One may bathe in a bathhouse where there is an idol; because it has been set up there as an ornament and not to be worshipped, as it is said, &#x201C;their gods&#x201D; (Deut. 7:16); that is, when they are honoured as gods, not however, when they are treated with contempt, as in this case where the idol stands over the drains, and everyone urinates before it. But if such constituted its mode of worship, it is forbidden to enter such a place.</p>
<p>19. If a knife belonging to an idol had been used to slaughter a beast, the carcase is permitted, because the act of slaughtering caused the beast to depreciate in value. But if the animal had been dangerously ill, the carcase is forbidden, because the value of the beast has been enhanced, and this enhancement is due to the use of a utensil belonging to an idol. So too, one may not cut meat with such a knife. But if the meat is cut in such a way as to spoil and destroy it, it is permitted.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VIII.</h1>
<p>1. Anything which cannot be handled or made by a human being, even though it is worshipped, is permitted to be used. Hence, mountains and hills, trees originally planted for their fruit, public springs and cattle, though worshipped by idolaters, are permitted to be used. Fruits that had been worshipped, while they were unsevered, may be eaten as also flesh of a beast that had been worshipped. Needless to add, a beast that had only been set apart for idolatrous purposes may be eaten, whether it had been set apart to be worshipped or to be offered up as a sacrifice. The rule that the beast does not become forbidden to be used, applies if one had done nothing to it for the sake of idolatry. But if one has done anything to it, however insignificant, he renders it forbidden. For example, if one slaughters a beast and severs either of its vessels (the trachea or oesophagus) for the sake of idolatry, or exchanges it for an object of idolatrous worship, he renders it forbidden. Such is also the rule if one exchanges it for something for which an idolatrous object had been exchanged; for all the things successively exchanged have become monetary equivalents of an idolatrous object. These rules only apply to a beast that is the property of the individual who did these acts. But if one slaughters, with idolatrous intent, a beast belonging to another person, or exchanges it for an object of idolatrous worship, it does not become forbidden, since a person cannot cause that which is not his property to become forbidden. A man who prostrates himself to the soil in its natural state does not render in forbidden. But he renders it forbidden, if he digs in it pits, ditches or caves.</p>
<p>2. If one prostrates himself to water carried by a wave, he does not render it forbidden. But if one took water in his hand and prostrated himself to it, he renders it forbidden. Mountain rocks that have become loosened and have been worshipped while still in their original situation, are permitted to be used, because they have not been handled by a human being.</p>
<p>3. If an Israelite set up a brick, in order to worship it, but did not do so, and a gentile came and prostrated himself before it, he renders it forbidden to be used, the setting up constituting the act (requisite to show the Israelite&#x2019;s intent that is should be worshipped).<xref rid="fn126">&#x002A;</xref> So too, if he set up an egg and a Gentile came and prostrated himself before it, he renders it forbidden to be used. If he cut a pumpkin or any thing similar, and worshipped it, he renders it forbidden to be used. If he worshipped half a pumpkin while the other half is still attached to it, the latter is forbidden to be used; because it is uncertain whether it is to be regarded as accessory to the half that was worshipped. A tree that was planted, from the outset, for the purpose of being worshipped, is forbidden to be used. This is the <italic>Asherah,</italic> mentioned in the Torah. If a tree had already been planted, and then was cut down and trimmed to serve as an idol, or even if a branch of it was forced into the ground and covered with soil or if it was grafted on another tree, and in either case produced twigs, these twigs are to be severed and are forbidden to be used, but the rest of the tree is permitted. So too, if any one worships a tree, although its trunk does not become forbidden, all twigs, leaves, shoots, and fruit which it produces, during the time that it is worshipped, are forbidden to be used. If Gentiles guard the fruit of a tree, declaring that it is intended to be converted into strong drink for a certain idolatrous temple, and they actually do make a strong drink of the fruit and drink it on their feast, the tree is forbidden to be used, because it is assumed to be an <italic>Asherah</italic> (idolatrous tree) and they deal thus with its fruit, because such is the ordinance of the <italic>Asherah.</italic></p>
<p>4. A tree, beneath which an idol was set up, may not be used, as long as the idol is there. Once the idol has been removed, the tree is permitted to be used, because it is not the object worshipped. A house which a gentile erected, with the original intent that it be worshipped, or a house already erected, that anyone worships, is forbidden to be used. If it had already been erected and was, for idolatrous purposes, plastered and ornamented so that it was renovated, the renovation is to be removed and may not be used, because it was made for idolatrous worship, but the rest of the structure is permitted to be used. If an idol was brought into a house&#x2014;as long as it is there, the house is forbidden to be used; after it has been removed, the house may again be used. A stone, originally hewed to be worshipped, is forbidden to be used. If it had already been hewed and was then painted and decorated, that it might be worshipped, even if the decorations are in the stone itself and, needless to say, if these are only superficial, the added decorations are to be removed and are forbidden, since they were made for worship, but the rest of the stone is permitted to be used.</p>
<p>5. A stone upon which an idol was set may not be used as long as the idol is on it. After the idol had been removed, it may be used. If one owned a house adjoining an idolatrous temple, and the house fell down, it may not be rebuilt. How should the owner act ? He should withdraw within the bounds of his own property and there rebuild the dwelling. The intervening empty space should be filled up with thorns or dirt, so that the area of the idolatrous temple will not be enlarged. If there was a party wall belonging to him and to the idol, he should consider the wall as divided in halves. The half on his side may be used. That on the side of the idol is wholly forbidden. Its stones, wood and earth are all forbidden to be used.</p>
<p>6. How are idols and other things such as its utensils and offerings, that are forbidden on its account, to be destroyed ? They are to be ground to powder and then scattered to the winds, or burnt and cast into the Dead Sea.<xref rid="fn127">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>7. Objects, in the making of which human hands have had no part, such as mountains, cattle, trees, though worshipped, may nevertheless be used. The covering of any such objects, however, is forbidden to be used. Whoever makes the least use of such covering is punished with stripes, as it is said, &#x201C;Thou shalt not covet the silver or the gold that is on them&#x201D; (Deut. 7:25). Any cover of an idol comes within the category of its appurtenances.</p>
<p>8. An idol belonging to idolaters which they had annulled (repudiated as an object of worship), before it passed into an Israelite&#x2019;s possession, may be used, as it is said &#x201C;the images of their gods ye shall burn with fire&#x201D; (Ibid. 7:25); that it is to say, only if they are treated as divine at the time when they come into our hands, are they to be destroyed, but if the idolaters had already declared them null, they are permitted to be used.</p>
<p>9. An idol belonging to an Israelite can never be nullified. Even if an idolater is part-owner, the latter&#x2019;s nullification is of no avail, but it remains for ever forbidden to be used and must be concealed. So too, if an idol belonging to an idolater came into an Israelite&#x2019;s possession and was subsequently nullified by the idolater, the nullification is of no avail; the idol remains for ever forbidden. An Israelite cannot nullify an idol even with the idolater&#x2019;s permission. An idolater, who is a minor or mentally defective, cannot nullify an idol. If an idolater nullified an idol, belonging to him or to other idolaters, even if he did so under duress, and even if it was an Israelite that forced him, the object loses its idolatrous character, provided that the gentile who annulled it is actually an idol-worshipper. Nullification by one not actually an idol-worshipper is of no avail. The nullification of an idol nullifies its accessories. If the accessories were nullified, they may be used, but the idol itself remains forbidden as hitherto, until it has been nullified. Offerings to an idol can never be nullified.</p>
<p>10. How does one nullify an idol ? If one chipped the tip of its ear, the tip of its nose, or its finger-tip, hammered in its face, even without loss of substance, or sold it to an Israelite who is a worker in metals, it is nullified. But if one pledged it or sold it to an idolater, or to an Israelite who is not a metal worker, or if <italic>d&#x00E9;bris</italic> fell upon it which the owner did not clear away, or if it had been stolen by robbers and no attempt has been made to reclaim it, or if one expectorated or urinated before it, or dragged it or threw ordure at it, it is not nullified.</p>
<p>11. An idol abandoned by its worshippers during a time of peace is permitted to be used, because it has been nullified (by the abandonement). If this has taken place in wartime, it remains forbidden, because the abandonment was on account of the war. If an idol had got broken of itself, its fragments are forbidden to be used, until the idol is nullified. Hence, if one finds fragments of an idol, they may not be used, for possibly the idolaters had not nullified it. If it consisted of parts that an unskilled person can put together, each of them must be separately nullified. If an unskilled person cannot put them together, the nullification of any limb of the idol makes all the fragments null.</p>
<p>12. An idolatrous altar that was damaged remains forbidden to be used till the larger part of it has been shattered by idolaters. A sacrificial hearth<xref rid="fn128">&#x002A;</xref> that was damaged is permitted to be used. What is the distinction between a hearth and an altar ? A hearth consists of a single stone; an altar, of many stones. How are the stones of the idol Mercury nullified ? As soon as an idolater has used them in erecting a building or in paving a road, and so forth, they are permitted to be used. How is the <italic>Asherah</italic> (an idolatrous tree) nullified ? As soon as the idolater plucked a leaf from it, cut off one of its shoots, took from it a stick or rod, or removed the bark when this was not necessary, it loses its idolatrous character. If this procedure was needed by the tree, it remains prohibited, but the shavings are permitted to be used. If the tree belonged to an Israelite, whether the scraping was necessary or not, the tree as well as the shavings are for ever forbidden to be used, because the idol of an Israelite can never lose its idolatrous character.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IX.</h1>
<p>1. Three days before the idolaters&#x2019; feast, it is forbidden to buy of them or sell to them anything durable; likewise to borrow of them or lend to them; repay to them money that had been borrowed or exact from them payment of a loan, secured by deed or pledge; but the payment of a personal loan (for which there is no pledge or deed) may be exacted, as it is equivalent to recovering from them what might otherwise be lost. Perishable products, such as vegetables or cooked food, may be sold to them, up to the day of their feast. These restrictions apply to Palestine. In other countries, they are only enforced on the feast day. If these rules were violated, and one engaged in commercial transactions with them during these three days, the proceeds may be used. But the proceeds of transactions with them on their feast day are forbidden to be used.</p>
<p>2. A gift may not be sent to a gentile on his feast day, unless the sender knows that the recipient neither professes nor practises idolatry. So too, if a gentile sent a gift to an Israelite, on his feast day, the latter should not accept it. If he apprehends that this might cause ill-will, he should accept it in the sender&#x2019;s presence, but not use it till he has ascertained that the gentile neither practises idolatry nor professes it.</p>
<p>3. If the gentiles&#x2019; feast lasts several days&#x2014;three, four or ten&#x2014;all of them are counted as one day, and the restrictions apply to them all as well as to the three preceding days.</p>
<p>4. The Nazarenes are idolaters.<xref rid="fn129">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> The first day of the week is their festival. Hence it is forbidden in Palestine to have commercial intercourse with them on the fifth and sixth day in each week; and obviously on the first day itself, this is everywhere forbidden. A similar rule applies to all their feasts.</p>
<p>5. The day on which idolaters meet to appoint a king, when they offer up sacrifices and sing hymns to their idols, is a feast day for them, just like their other feasts. But if an idolater institutes a personal feast day, an which he thanks his idol and lauds it, such as on his birthday, or the day when he trims his beard or the locks of his head, lands after a sea voyage, leaves prison, or gives a banquet in honour of his son, and so forth, commercial and social intercourse is only prohibited on that day, and only with that individual. So too, if idolaters, who have suffered a bereavement, keep the day of death as a solemn day, the prohibition only applies to intercourse with the individuals who so observe it, and is limited to the day. Whenever, in connection with a death, utensils are burnt and incense is offered up, it is certain that idolatry forms an element in the obsequies. Commercial and social intercourse on a feast day is prohibited with those only who worship an idol on that day, but is permitted with those who make merry and eat and drink on it, observing the day as a custom or keeping it out of respect to the sovereign, but not accepting it as a religious feast.</p>
<p>6. Things, specifically appropriated to the worship of a particular idol in a certain locality, may not be sold at any time to the worshippers of that idol in that place. Things not so specially appropriated may be sold, if no mention is made of the purpose for which they are to be used. But if the gentile explicitly states that he buys them for idolatrous purposes, they may not be sold to him, unless first rendered unfit to be offered up to the idol; for the gentiles do not offer up to an idol any thing defective.</p>
<p>7. If things specially appropriated to idolatry have been mixed up with things not so appropriated, as, for example, pure frankincense with the black variety, the whole may be sold, provided no mention is made of any intended idolatrous purpose. And we do not apprehend that the idolater will sort out the pure frankincense for idolatrous use; and so with analogous cases.</p>
<p>8. Just as those things may not be sold to gentiles, which confirm them in idolatry, so beasts or things may not be sold to them which involve danger to the public; such as bears and lions, military arms, fetters and chains. Military arms are not to be sharpened for them. Whatever is forbidden to be sold to a gentile, may not be sold to an Israelite who is suspected of reselling it to a gentile. So too, it is forbidden to sell articles of a dangerous character to an Israelite who is a robber.</p>
<p>9. Israelites who live among gentiles, and have made a covenant of peace with them are permitted to sell military arms to the king&#x2019;s servants and forces, since the latter use these weapons to defend the country against its enemies, and so protect us who live among them. On the day when the population of a city is celebrating a feast in honour of an idol, it is permitted to travel outside the city, but not to enter it. If the celebration is outside the city, walking within the city is permitted.</p>
<p>10. A traveller from one place to another may not pass through a city where an idolatrous celebration is taking place. This is only so where the road (through the idolatrous city) is the only one leading to the traveller&#x2019;s destination. If there is also another road and he happened to be on the first road, he may use it.</p>
<p>11. It is forbidden to work with gentiles in the erection of a niche in which an idol is to be set up. But if one violated this rule and built it, he may use his wages. There is no objection to the building of a palace or a courtyard which contains (or will contain) such a niche.</p>
<p>12. If, in a city celebrating a feast to its idol, some shops are decorated while others are not, the contents of the decorated shops may not be used, the presumption being that they are decorated in honour of the idol. But the goods in the undecorated shops may be used. One may not become a tenant of shops that are the property of an idolatrous corporation, since this would be to the advantage of idolatry.</p>
<p>13. If one sells a house for purposes of idolatry, the purchase money is forbidden to be used and must be cast into the Dead Sea. But if idolaters overpowered an Israelite, took his house by force and set up an idol in it, its purchase money may be used; and the owner draws up and registers a claim in the gentile courts. Flutes belonging to idolaters may not be used for music at obsequies (of Israelites).</p>
<p>14. One may attend a fair of gentiles and make purchases there of cattle, heathen male and female slaves, houses, fields and vineyards. The purchaser draws up the records of sale and registers them in the gentile courts, since he is, as it were, salvaging his property from them. This however, only applies to purchases from a private individual who does not pay market dues. But purchases from a dealer are forbidden to be used, since the dealer pays toll which goes to the idol; and so the purchaser is benefiting idolatry. In case this rule was violated and any thing had been bought from a dealer, if the purchase is a domestic animal, its hoofs must be hacked off below the joint of the leg; if, it is a garment or utensils, they should be suffered to decay; if it is coin or metal plate, they should be cast into the Dead Sea; if a slave, he is neither rescued from a pit nor raised from it.<xref rid="fn130">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>15. When an idolater gives a feast to celebrate the wedding of his son or daughter, it is forbidden to partake of the banquet. An Israelite is even forbidden to eat there his own food or drink his own liquor, as he would be consuming it in the company of idolaters.<xref rid="fn131">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> For how long is he forbidden to eat with them ? From the moment when the idolater begins to busy himself with preparations for the feast; and the prohibition is in force, during the time that the feast is held and continues for thirty days after its termination. If the idolater gives a second feast, in honour of the marriage, even after the expiration of thirty days from the conclusion of the former feast, the prohibition extends for a twelve-month. The purpose of this separation is to avoid idolatry, as it is said, &#x201C;&#x2026;. and one will call thee and thou wilt eat of his sacrifice; and take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their daughters will go astray after their gods and make thy sons go astray after their gods&#x201D;. (Ex. 34:15-16).</p>
<p>16. An Israelite woman should not suckle the infant of a non-Israelite mother, for she would be bringing up a child to idolatry. Nor should she act as a midwife to a non-Israelite woman; but she may attend professionally for a fee, so as to prevent ill-will. A gentile woman may be engaged as midwife to an Israelite woman or as wet-nurse for her babe, provided the gentile nurse is under the mother&#x2019;s supervision, so that she will not kill the infant.</p>
<p>17. To do business with pilgrims to idolatrous shrines, while they are on their journey thither is forbidden, but is permitted with those who are returning, providing they are not travelling in companies, the members of which are closely attached to each other; for in this case they may have it in mind to return to the shrine. If an Israelite is proceeding to an idolatrous shrine, one may do business with him while he is on his way thither, for possibly he may turn back; but it is not permitted when he is returning. It is forbidden to trade with an apostate Israelite while he is on his way to an idolatrous shrine or returning thence.</p>
<p>18. If an Israelite went to an idolaters&#x2019; fair, it is forbidden to trade with him on his return journey, for fear that he may have sold an idol there, and the price of an idol in an Israelite&#x2019;s possession may not be used. If the price is in an idolater&#x2019;s possession, it may be used. Hence, trading is permitted with an idolater on his return from an idolatrous shrine, but not with an Israelite when he comes from such a shrine, nor with an apostate Israelite either on his journey thither or on his return.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER X.</h1>
<p>1. No covenant is to be made with idolaters, with the purpose of making peace with them and permitting them to worship idols, as it is said &#x201C;thou shalt make no covenant with them&#x201D; (Deut. 7:2); but they must either renounce their idolatry or suffer death. It is forbidden to show them mercy, as it is said, &#x201C;nor show mercy unto them&#x201D; (ibid.). Hence, if one sees a heathen who worships idols perishing or drowning, one is not to save him. If he was observed to be dying, he is not to be rescued. It is forbidden however, actively to destroy him, or thrust him into a pit or do any thing similar, since he is not waging war against us. These rules apply to a heathen. But as regards informers and Israelite infidels, it is a duty to take active measures to destroy them and hurl them into the pit of destruction&#x2014;the reason being that they persecute Israelites and turn the people away from following God.</p>
<p>2. Hence you learn that it is forbidden to heal idolaters even for a fee. But if one is afraid of them or apprehends that refusal might cause ill-will, medical treatment may be given for a fee but not gratuitously. A &#x201C;denizen proselyte&#x201D;,<xref rid="fn132">&#x002A;</xref> whose life we are commanded to preserve, is to be healed without charge.</p>
<p>3. Houses and fields are not sold to them in Palestine. In Syria, houses are sold to them, but not fields. Houses are let to them in Palestine, provided they do not form a settlement; less than three families (living in one location) do not constitute a settlement. Fields are not let to them there; but in Syria they are let to them. And why were they (the Sages) so stringent with a field ? Because it would have two consequences: The land would be exempted from the payment of tithes; and it would give idolaters advantages from the soil of Palestine. Outside that land, houses and fields may be sold to them&#x2014;it not being our country.</p>
<p>4. Even where (the Sages) permitted the letting of a building, they did not permit it to be let for residence, because the tenant would bring an idol into it, and it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt not bring an abomination into thy house&#x201D; (Deut. 7:26). But buildings may be let to idolaters to be used for storage. The fruits of an orchard or field etc., may not be sold to them, while pendent on the tree or attached to the soil. But the owner may sell them the fruits after they have been severed, or on condition that he shall sever them and he does sever them. Why have these restrictions been imposed on sales ? Because it is said &#x201C;thou shalt show them no favour&#x201D; (Deut. 7:2), which may be rendered &#x201C;do not permit them a settlement in the land&#x201D;<xref rid="fn133">&#x002A;</xref>;&#x2014;if they have no land, their residence will be temporary. It is forbidden to speak of them eulogistically&#x2014;even to say, &#x2018;how comely is this gentile, and <italic>a fortiori</italic> it is forbidden to speak in praise of his acts&#x2014;or to hold dear any thing that belongs to them, as it is said. &#x201C;Thou shalt not show them favour&#x201D; (ibid.); that is, &#x201C;they shall have no favour in thine eyes&#x201D;, as this would induce a feeling of attachment to the idolater and cause us to learn from him his evil ways. So too it is forbidden to make gifts to them; these may however be bestowed on a denizen proselyte, as it is said &#x201C;unto the stranger that is within thy gates, thou shalt give it, that he may eat it; or thou mayest sell it to a foreigner&#x201D; (Deut. 14:21). A sale may thus be made to a foreigner but not a gift.</p>
<p>5. For the sake of peace, indigent gentiles receive maintenance like poor Israelites; and for the sake of peace, they are not hindered when gleaning or gathering forgotten sheaves or the produce of the corner of the fields (Lev. 23:22; Deut. 24:19). For the sake of peace, we greet them even on their feast. But at no time do we give them a double greeting,<xref rid="fn134">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> nor do we enter an alien&#x2019;s home on his festival in order to greet him. If one meets him in the street, one salutes him in a low tone and with a grave mien.</p>
<p>6. The foregoing rules apply to the time when the people of Israel live exiled among the nations, or when the gentile&#x2019;s power is predominant. But when Israel is predominant over the nations of the world, we are forbidden to permit a gentile who is an idolater to dwell among us. He must not enter our land, even as a temporary resident; or even as a traveller, journeying with merchandise from place to place, till he has undertaken to keep the seven precepts which the Noachides were commanded to observe; as it is said, &#x201C;They shall not dwell in thy land&#x201D; (Ex. 23:33)&#x2014;even for a time. If he undertakes to observe these seven precepts, he becomes a denizen proselyte. We only accept a denizen proselyte, at the time when the law of the Jubilee is in force.<xref rid="fn135">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> But at the period when the law of the Jubilee is in abeyance, only a proselyte of righteousness (a full proselyte) is accepted.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER XI.</h1>
<p>1. (We) should not follow the customs of the gentiles, nor imitate them in dress or in their way of trimming the hair, as it is said, &#x201C;And ye shall not walk in the customs of the nation (which I cast out before you)&#x201D; (Lev. 20:23); &#x201C;neither shall ye walk in their statutes&#x201D; (Lev. 18:3); &#x201C;Take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared to follow them&#x201D; (Deut. 12:30). These texts all refer to one theme and warn against imitating them. The Israelite shall, on the contrary, be distinguished from them and recognisable by the way he dresses and in his other activities, just as he is distinguished from them by his knowledge and his principles. And thus is it said, &#x201C;And I have set you apart from the peoples&#x201D; (Lev. 20:26). He shall not put on a garment like that specially worn by them nor let the lock of his hair grow in the way they do. Thus, he shall not cut the hair of the head at the sides, leaving the hair in the centre untouched as they do&#x2014;this is called &#x201C;growing the forelock&#x201D;. Nor shall he cut the hair in front from ear to ear, leaving the hair at the back to grow, as they do. He shall not rear edifices resembling idolatrous temples for the gathering of multitudes, as they do. Whoever does any of these or similar things is punished with stripes.</p>
<p>2. When a gentile has his hair cut by an Israelite, the latter must leave three finger breadths on each side of the forelock, uncut.</p>
<p>3. An Israelite, having access to royalty, who has to appear before gentile sovereigns, and to whom it would be a disgrace not to look like gentiles, is permitted to put on apparel like theirs, and cut his hair in front, after their fashion.</p>
<p>4. Israelites may not resort to divination like the gentiles, as it is said, &#x201C;neither shall ye practice divination&#x201D; (Lev. 19:26). What is divination? The following are examples. To say: &#x201C;Since my piece of bread dropped out of my mouth or my staff fell from my hand, I shall not go today to such a place, for if I go, my business will not be successfully accomplished&#x201D;; or, &#x201C;since a fox ran past me on the right, I shall not today go outside the door of my house, for if I do, a cheat will accost me&#x201D;; or when people hear a bird twittering and say; &#x201C;It will happen thus and not thus&#x201D;&#x2014;&#x201C;it is good to do this, and bad to do that&#x201D;; or when people say: &#x201C;Kill this cock because it crowed in the evening&#x201D;; &#x201C;kill this hen because it crowed like a cock&#x201D;; or if one sets for himself a sign and says, &#x201C;If a certain thing happens to me, I will follow this course of action; it it is does not happen, I will not do so&#x201D;,&#x2014;as Eleazar, Abraham&#x2019;s servant did&#x2014;these and all things similar are forbidden. Whoever does any thing as a result of any of these happenings is punished with stripes.</p>
<p>5. To say: &#x201C;This dwelling which I built has turned out lucky for me; this woman that I married was a blessing to me; from the moment that I bought this beast, I became rich;&#x201D; or to ask a child, &#x201C;What verse art thou learning&#x201D;, and if the child recites a verse from the Blessings, to rejoice and say: &#x201C;that is a lucky sign&#x201D;&#x2014;all these and similar things are permitted. For, as the person did not adjust his activities in accordance with them nor refrained from doing aught because of them, but only regarded them as signs of what had already happened, such acceptance is permitted.</p>
<p>6. What is a diviner ? One who does any act, so that he may fall into an ecstatic state and his mind be withdrawn from all externals, after which he foretells future events, saying &#x201C;This will, or will not, come to pass&#x201D;, or &#x201C;It is proper to do this&#x201D;, or &#x201C;Beware of doing that&#x201D;. Some diviners make use of sand or stones; one bends down to the earth and screams; another fixes his gaze on a brass mirror or a lamp; and then they imagine things and speak accordingly. Another carries a staff in his hand, leans on it and strikes with it till his mind is in a state of abstraction and then he speaks; the prophet refers to this when he says, &#x201C;My people ask counsel of their stock and their staff declareth unto them&#x201D; (Hosea. 4:12).</p>
<p>7. It is forbidden to practise divination or consult a diviner. The difference between them is that one who consults a diviner is punished with stripes for contumacy; while the diviner himself who does any of these or similar things receives stripes according to the Scriptural statute, as it is said &#x201C;There shall not be found among you anyone&#x2026;. that useth divination&#x201D; (Deut. 18:10).</p>
<p>8. What is an &#x201C;observer of times&#x201D; ? The term applies to these who assign seasons declaring that astrologically a particular day is favourable, while another day is unfavourable; that a cetain day is propitious for the execution of a specific work and a certain year or month is unfavourable for a specific thing.</p>
<p>9. It is forbidden to be an &#x201C;observer of times&#x201D;<xref rid="fn136">&#x002A;</xref> even if he committed no overt act but only uttered the lies which fools imagine are words of truth, words of the wise. And whoever is influenced in his actions by astrology and arranges his work or journey to take place at the time fixed by the astrologers, is punished with stripes, as it is said &#x201C;Ye shall not observe times&#x201D; (Lev. 19:26). So too, a conjurer who deceives the eyes and pretends to the beholder to be doing something extraordinary which in reality he does not do, is included in the category of &#x201C;observers of times&#x201D; and is punished with stripes.</p>
<p>10. What is a charmer ? One who utters words that are not part of any spoken language and are meaningless, foolishly fancying that these words are helpful. These charmers go as far as to say that if one utters certain words over a snake or scorpion, it will become harmless, and if one utters certain words over a man, he will not be hurt by the reptiles. The charmer, while speaking, holds, in his hand, a key, stone or other objects&#x2014;all this is forbidden. The charmer himself who held any object in his hand or did any act beside speaking, even if he only pointed with his finger, is punished with stripes according to the Scriptural statute, as it is said &#x201C;There shall not be found among you &#x2026;. a charmer&#x201D; (Deut. 18:11). But if he only uttered words, and neither moved his finger nor his hand nor held any thing in his hand, he, as well as the person over whom the charmer uttered those sounds and who sits in his presence, fancying that he is deriving some benefit, are punished with stripes for contumacy; the latter because he took part in the charmer&#x2019;s folly. All those strange and uncouth sounds and names do no harm, nor have they power to do good.</p>
<p>11. If one was stung by a scorpion or a snake, it is permitted, even on the Sabbath, to whisper a spell over the part affected, so as to soothe the patient and give him reassurance. Although the procedure is absolutely useless, it has been permitted because of the patient&#x2019;s dangerous condition, so that he should not become distraught.</p>
<p>12. One who whispers a spell over a wound, at the same time reciting a verse from the Torah, one who recites a verse over a child to save it from terrors and one who places a scroll or phylacteries on an infant, to induce it to sleep, are not in the category of sorcerers and soothsayers, but they are included among those who repudiate the Torah; for they use its words to cure the body whereas these are only medicine for the soul, as it is said, &#x201C;they shall be life unto thy soul&#x201D; (Prov. 3:22). On the other hand, any one in the enjoyment of good health is permitted to recite verses from the Scriptures or a psalm, so that he may be shielded by the merit of the recital and saved from trouble and hurt.</p>
<p>13. What is a necromancer? One who starves himself and goes and spends the night in a cemetery in order that the dead shall appear to him in a dream and instruct him on matters about which he enquires. Others again put on special robes, utter certain words, offer a special incense and sleep alone, so that a particular dead person shall appear to them in a dream and converse with them. Whoever does anything, in order that the dead shall come and instruct him, is punished with stripes, as it is said, &#x201C;There shall not be found among you&#x2026;. a necromancer&#x201D; (Deut. 18:11).</p>
<p>14. It is forbidden to consult one who professes to have a ghost or a familiar spirit, as it is said, &#x201C;There shall not be found among you one who&#x2026;. consulteth a ghost or a familiar spirit&#x201D; (Deut. 18:11). Hence, it is learnt that while one who professes to have a familiar spirit is punished with death by stoning, whoever consults such people violates a prohibition and is punished with stripes for contumacy. If he regulates his activities according to their instructions, he is punished with stripes according to scriptural statute.</p>
<p>15. The wizard incurs the penalty of death by stoning, provided he actually practised witchcraft. A juggler, however, who only makes it appear that he did something, which he did not do, is punished with stripes for contumacy. For though the prohibition of witchcraft is included in the text &#x201C;There shall not be found among you one who consulteth a ghost&#x2026;.&#x201D; (Deut. 18:10), it is an offence for which a judicial sentence of death is the penalty prescribed, as it is said &#x201C;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live&#x201D; (Ex. 22:17) and therefore stripes are, according to the Scriptural statute, not inflicted.<xref rid="fn137">&#x002A;</xref></p>
<p>16. These practices are all false and deceptive, and were means employed by the ancient idolaters to deceive the peoples of various countries and induce them to become their followers. It is not proper for Israelites who are highly intelligent to suffer themselves to be deluded by such inanities or imagine that there is anything in them, as it is said &#x201C;For there is no enchantment with Jacob, neither is there any divination with Israel&#x201D; (Num. 23:23); and further, &#x201C;For these nations that thou art to dispossess hearken unto sooth-sayers and unto diviners; but as for thee, the Lord, thy God, hath not suffered thee so to do&#x201D; (Deut. 18:14). Whoever believes in these and similar things and, in his heart, holds them to be true and scientific and only forbidden by the Torah, is nothing but a fool, deficient in understanding, who belongs to the same class with women and children whose intellects are immature. Sensible people, however, who possess sound mental faculties, know by clear proofs that all these practices which the Torah prohibited have no scientific basis but are chimerical and inane; and that only those deficient in knowledge are attracted by these follies and, for their sake, leave the ways of truth. The Torah, therefore, in forbidding all these follies, exhorts us, &#x201C;Thou shalt be whole-hearted with the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 18:13).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER XII.</h1>
<p>1. The corners of the head are not be shaved as the idolaters and their priests used to do, as it is said &#x201C;ye shall not round the corners of your heads&#x201D; (Lev. 19:27). One incurs a separate penalty for each corner. Accordingly, if one shaves both temples, even at one time and after one warning, he is punished with stripes twice. Whether he shaves the corners only, leaving the rest of the head untouched, or shaves the entire head at one time, he is punished with stripes, because he shaved the corners. The liability attaches to the man who shaves. But the man who is shaved is not punished with stripes, unless he assisted the barber. One who shaves the corners of a male child&#x2019;s head is punished with stripes.</p>
<p>2. A woman who shaves the corner of a man&#x2019;s head, or had the corner of her head shaved is not liable, for it is said, &#x201C;ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corner of thy beard&#x201D; (Lev. 19:27). Whoever is bound by the latter prohibition, is bound by the former. And since the latter prohibition cannot apply to a woman, neither does the former apply to her. Hence, (non-Israelite) male slaves of an Israelite, because they have beards, are forbidden to round the corners of their heads.</p>
<p>3. All the prohibition of the Torah are binding on women as well as men, with the exception of those relating to marring the beard and rounding the head, and that a priest shall not defile himself by contact with the dead, (Lev. 21:1 et seq.). Women are exempt from the obligation of affirmative precepts, performed at definite periods and not continuously, with the following exceptions: to sanctify the advent of the holy (Sabbath) day (Ex. 20:8); to eat unleavened bread on the first two evenings of Passover (Ex. 12:15); to eat of the Paschal lamb (Ex. 12:8); to slaughter it (ibid. 12:8); to assemble (on the Feast of the Tabernacles, every seventh year to hear the Law read) (Deut. 31:12); and to rejoice on the festivals (Deut. 16:14). These precepts are binding on women also.</p>
<p>4. A person whose sex is undetermined<xref rid="fn138">&#x002A;</xref> and one who has the characteristic marks of both sexes<xref rid="fn139">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> are of doubtful status. They are subject to the stringencies of both sexes and bound to observe all obligations (imposed on either sex); but if they transgress such prohibitions), they are not punished with stripes.</p>
<p>5. Although a woman may shave the corners of her head, she may not shave the corners of a man&#x2019;s head or that of a male child.</p>
<p>6. How much of the locks over the temples is to be left, the sages have not definitely. stated. We have heard from our elders that at least forty hairs must remain. These locks may be removed with scissors; only destruction with a razor is forbidden.</p>
<p>7. The idolatrous priests had the custom of removing the beard. The Torah, accordingly, forbade this practice. There are five parts of the beard that must not be removed; the hair upon the upper and the lower jaw, on the right as well as on the left side, and the peak of the beard. Removal of the hair at any one of these places involves the penalty of stripes. If one removes all of them at one operation, he is punished five times, but only if he uses a razor; as it is said, &#x201C;thou shalt not mar the corner of thy beard&#x201D; (Lev. 19:27), which refers to the use of the razor&#x2014;this involving complete destruction of the hair, but there is no liability for cutting the beard with scissors. The person shaved is not punished with stripes, unless he assists. A woman may use a razor to remove any hair that she has on her face. Nor is she liable to punishment for shaving a man&#x2019;s beard.</p>
<p>8. The moustache, that is, the hair upon the upper lip and also the hair hanging down from the lower lip, may be removed with a razor. But although permitted, Israelites have the custom of not removing this hair completely but only a portion&#x2014;enough to save one from being incommoded while eating or drinking.</p>
<p>9. The removal of hair from the rest of the body, as, for instance, from the armpit and privy parts, is not forbidden by the Torah but by the Scribes. Whoever removes it is punished with stripes for contumacy. This rule is limited to localities where women alone remove this hair&#x2014;the object being to prevent a man trimming himself in a fashion peculiar to women. But in localities where it is customary for members of both sexes to remove hair of this description, a man who does so, is not punished with stripes. The removal of hair from other limbs with scissors is everywhere permitted.</p>
<p>10. A woman may not adorn herself with men&#x2019;s special ornaments; as for instance, by placing a mitre or helmet on her head, or putting on a coat of mail or anything similar, or cutting her hair short, after the fashion of a man. And a man must not adorn himself in the modes peculiar to women, as, for example, by wearing garments of bright hues, or golden jewellery, in localities where such garments or jewels are only worn by women. In these respects, the custom of the country governs. A man who has put on women&#x2019;s adornments or a woman who has adorned herself in the modes peculiar to men, is punished with stripes. Whoever plucks out white hairs in his beard or in his head from among the dark, is punished with stripes&#x2014;even if he has removed only one hair&#x2014;the offence being the use of adornments peculiar to women. So too, one who dyes his hair a dark colour, even if he has only dyed a single white hair, is punished with stripes. One whose sex is undetermined and an hermaphrodite may not put on woman&#x2019;s apparel nor cut the hair of their heads in men&#x2019;s fashion; but if they do so, they are not punished with stripes.</p>
<p>11. Tattooing, mentioned in the Torah (Lev. 19:28), consists in cutting the flesh and filling up the cut with pigment, ink or other printing matter which leaves an indelible mark. This was a custom of the heathens who used so to mark themselves for idolatry, as much as to say that the tattooed was a slave sold to the idol and marked for its service. As soon as one prints with any material that leaves an indelible mark, having previously made an incision in any part of the body, whether it be a man or woman, that person incurs the punishment of stripes. If he wrote on the flesh (by incision), without marking with printing matter, or marked with printing matter without writing (by incision), he is not liable. He is only liable if he has written (by incision) and made tattooing marks, as it is said, &#x201C;nor print any marks&#x201D; (Lev. 19:28). This rule applies to the tattooer, but the person whose flesh is tattooed is not liable unless he assisted by some act. If he did nothing, he is not punished with stripes.</p>
<p>12. Whoever makes a single incision in his flesh for the dead is punished with stripes, as it is said, &#x201C;ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead&#x201D; (Lev. 19:28). The law is the same, whether it be a priest or an Israelite who does this. If one made a single incision for five dead persons, or five incisions for one dead person, he is punished with stripes five times, provided that he received a separate warning for each case.</p>
<p>13. <italic>Gedidah</italic> (cutting) and <italic>Seritah</italic> (Making incisions) are identical. And even as the idolaters used to make incisions in their flesh for their dead&#x2014;as an expression of grief&#x2014;so they used to wound themselves for the sake of idolatry, as it is said, &#x201C;And they cut themselves after their manner&#x201D; (I. Kings 18:28). This procedure too was forbidden by the Torah, as it is said, &#x201C;ye shall not cut yourselves&#x201D; (Deut. 14:1). There is this distinction however. Where the incision was for the dead, whether it was done with the hand or with an instrument, the offender is punished with stripes. But if it was for the sake of idolatry, he is only liable if he cut himself with an instrument; but if he did so with his hand, he is not liable.</p>
<p>14. Included in this prohibition is the rule that in one city there shall not be two courts of law following different procedures; for such a course would lead to strife, as it is said, &#x201C;Ye shall not cut yourselves&#x201D; (Lev. 19:28) which has been interpreted &#x201C;Ye shall not divide up into factions&#x201D;.</p>
<p>15. One who makes a bald spot on his head for a dead person is punished with stripes, as it is said &#x201C;Nor shall ye make a baldness between your eyes for the dead&#x201D; (Deut. 14:1). Whether it was an Israelite or a priest that made the bald spot for the dead, he is only punished with stripes once.<xref rid="fn140">&#x002A;</xref> If one makes four or five bald  spots<xref rid="fn141">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> for one dead person, he is punished with the statutory number of stripes according to the number of bald spots, provided he received a separate warning for each spot. Whether he made the bald spot with his hand or with a salve, or dipped his fingers into a salve and placed them upon his hand in five different places at one time, he is punished with stripes five times, because he made five bald spots, even if he had only received one warning since all the five bald spots were made at one time. He is liable for making a bald spot in any part of his head just as much as if he made it in a line with the part which is between the eyes, as it is said, &#x201C;They shall not make baldness upon their head&#x201D; (Lev. 21:5). How large must the bald spot be (to constitute a violation of the law)? A spot on the head which looks the size of a split pea and which is free of hair.</p>
<p>16. He who makes a bald spot on his head or a cut in his flesh, because his dwelling collapsed or because his ship was wrecked, is exempt from punishment. That person only is liable who does these things for the dead or makes a cut in his flesh for idolatry. When one makes a bald spot on the head of another person or a cut in another person&#x2019;s flesh, or tattoos another person, and the subject of the operation assists, if both act with knowledge that it is unlawful, both are punished with stripes. If one of them acted unwittingly while the other had guilty knowledge, the latter only is punished with stripes, the former is exempt.</p>

<chapter>
<title>LAWS OF REPENTANCE.</title>
<p>These are comprised in one affirmative precept, namely, that the sinner shall repent of his sin before the Lord and make confession. The exposition of this precept and of the principles connected with it, and which exist for its sake, are discussed in the following chapters.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER I.</h1>
<p>1.<xref rid="fn142">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> With regard to all the precepts of the Torah, affirmative or negative, if a person transgressed any one of them, either wilfully or in error, and repents and turns away from his sin, he is under a duty to confess before God, blessed be He, as it is said, &#x201C;When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the Lord, and that person be guilty, then they shall confess their sin which they have done&#x201D; (Num. 5:6-7); this means <italic>confess in words</italic>; and this confession is an affirmative precept.<xref rid="fn143">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> How does one confess ? The penitent says &#x201C;I beseech thee, O Lord, I have sinned, I have acted perversely; I have transgressed before Thee, and have done thus and thus, and lo, I repent and am ashamed of my deeds, and I will never do this again&#x201D;. This constitutes the essence of Confession. The fuller and more detailed the confession one makes, the more praiseworthy is he. III. And so, those who were under an obligation to bring sin-offerings and trespass-offerings, when they bring their sacrifices for sins committed in error or wilfully, are not forgiven through those offerings, till they have repented and made confession in words, as it is said, &#x201C;&#x2026;.he shall confess that wherein he hath sinned&#x201D; (Lev. 5:5). IV. So too, those who incurred the judicial penalty of death or punishment of stripes, do not obtain forgiveness by suffering death or receiving stripes unless they repent and confess. Similarly, one who inflicted a wound on another person, or caused him monetary damage, even though he pays what is due to the injured party, does not obtain pardon till he confesses and penitently resolves never to commit the same offence again, as it is said, &#x201C;(when a man or woman) shall commit any sin that men commit &#x2026;. then they shall confess&#x201D; (Num. 5:6-7).</p>
<p>2. V. Since the scapegoat, was an atonement for all Israel, the High Priest made confession over it in the name of all Israel, as it is said &#x201C;and he shall confess over it all the iniquities of the children of Israel&#x201D; (Lev. 16:21). VI. The scapegoat atoned for all transgressions mentioned in the Torah, both light and grave, whether committed presumptuously or in error, whether the offender became aware of his transgression, or did not become aware of it; for all sins the scapegoat atoned, provided that the offender repented. But if he did not repent, then the scapegoat only secures forgiveness for the light transgressions. VII. Which are the light, and which the grave transgressions ? The grave transgressions are those which make the offender liable to a judicial sentence of death or to excision. Likewise, oaths taken in vain or to support a falsehood, though not involving the penalty of excision, are classed among the grave transgressions. Violations of other prohibitions and of affirmative precepts, the neglect of which is not punished by excision, constitute the light transgressions.</p>
<p>3. VIII. At the present time, when the Temple no longer exists, and we have no altar for atonement, nothing is left but repentance. Repentance atones for all transgressions. Even if a man was wicked all the days of his life and repented at the end, nothing of his wickedness is recalled to him, as it is said &#x201C;And as for the wickedness of the wicked, he shall not stumble thereby in the day that he turns from his wickedness&#x201D; (Ezek. 33:12). The Day of Atonement itself atones for the penitent, as it is said, &#x201C;For on this day, shall atonement be made for you&#x201D; (Lev. 16:30).</p>
<p>4. IX. Although Repentance atones for all offences and the Day of Atonement serves as atonement, still there are some transgressions that are forgiven immediately, while others are pardoned only after a time. For example, if a person transgressed an affirmative precept, the neglect of which is not punished by excision, and repented, he is forgiven straightway. Of those who commit this class of offences, it is said, &#x201C;Return ye backsliding children, I will heal your backsliding&#x201D; (Jerem. 3:22). X. A person violated a prohibition, the penalty for which is neither excision nor a judicial sentence of death and repented, the repentance stays the punishment and the Day of Atonement secures pardon. Of this class of offences, it is said, &#x201C;For on this day shall atonement be made for you&#x201D; (Lev. 15:30). XI. A person committed transgressions for which the penalty is excision or a judicial sentence of death, and repented; repentance together with the Day of Atonement stay the punishment, and afflictions that come upon him complete the expiation; and indeed, till he has suffered afflictions, the expiation is not completed. Of this class of offence, it is said, &#x201C;Then will I visit their transgressions with the rod and their iniquity with strokes&#x201D; (Ps. 89:33). XII. This is only so if, at the time when he transgressed, he had not profaned the Name of God. But if one profanes God&#x2019;s Name, even though he repents, even though the Day of Atonement comes and he is still penitent, even if he suffers afflictions, his atonement is not completed till he dies. Repentance, the Day of Atonement and afflictions&#x2014;all of them together&#x2014;serve to stay punishment, and death secures forgiveness, as it is said, &#x201C;And it was revealed in mine ears by the Lord of Hosts, surely this iniquity shall not be expiated by you till ye die&#x201D; (Is. 22:14).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER II.</h1>
<p>1. What is perfect repentance ? It is so when an opportunity presents itself for repeating an offence once committed, and the offender, while able to commit the offence, nevertheless refrains from doing so, because he is penitent and not out of fear or failure of vigour. For instance, if a man had sinful intercourse with a woman, and after a time was alone with her, his passion for her persisting, his physical powers unabated while he continued to live in the same district where he had sinned, and yet he refrains and does not transgress, he is a sincere penitent. And so Solomon said, &#x201C;Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth before the evil days come, and the years draw nigh, when thou shalt say &#x2018;I have no pleasure in them&#x2019;&#x201D; (Eccles. 12:1). II. If however, a person only repented in old age, at a time when he is no longer capable of doing what he had done&#x2014;although this is not an excellent mode of repentance, it nevertheless avails him and he is accepted as a penitent. Even if one transgressed all his life and only repented on the day of his death and dies penitent, all his iniquities are pardoned to him, as it is said &#x201C;Before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain&#x201D; (Eccles. 12:2)&#x2014;which is an allusion to the day of death. Hence the inference that if one remembers his Creator and repents before death, he is forgiven.</p>
<p>2. III. What is Repentance ? It consists in this, that the sinner abandon his sin, remove it from his thoughts, and resolve in his heart never to repeat it, as it is said, &#x201C;let the wicked forsake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts&#x201D; (Is. 55:7); that he regret the past, as it is said, &#x201C;Surely, after that I turned I repented, after that I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh&#x201D; (Jer. 31:19); that he calls Him who knows all secrets to witness that he will never return to this sin again, as it is said, &#x201C;neither will we call any more the work of our hands our God, for in Thee the fatherless findeth mercy&#x201D; (Hos. 14:4). It is also necessary that he make oral confession and utter the resolutions which he made in his heart.</p>
<p>3. IV. He who confesses in words and has not in his heart resolved to forsake his sin is like one who baptizes himself and keeps in his hand a creeping thing. Unless he casts it away, his baptism is useless. And thus it is said, &#x201C;but whoso confesseth and forsaketh (them) shall obtain mercy&#x201D; (Prov. 28:13). Moreover it is necessary to specify the sin, as it is said, &#x201C;O, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them a god of gold&#x201D; (Ex. 32:31).</p>
<p>4. V. Some of the modes of manifesting repentance are that the penitent cries continuously before the Lord with tears and supplications; gives charity according to his means; keeps far away from that wherein he sinned; changes his name, as much as to say: &#x201C;I am another individual and not the one who committed those deeds&#x201D;; changes all his activities for a better course, for the righeous way; and exiles himself from his former place of residence, since exile atones for iniquity, inducing, as it does, humility, meekeness and lowliness of spirit.</p>
<p>5. VI. It is highly praiseworthy in a penitent to make public confession, openly avow his transgressions and discover to others his sins against his fellow-men; he should say to them: &#x201C;Truly, I have sinned against so and so, and did thus and thus to him; and 10, this day, I repent and feel remorse&#x201D;. He, however, who is proud and does not publish his trespasses but conceals them, has not achieved complete repentance, as it is said, &#x201C;He who covereth his transgressions shall not prosper&#x201D; (Prov. 28:13). VII. This only applies to transgressions in matters between man and man. But sins committed against God, the penitent need not publish. Indeed, it is a mark of effrontery on his part if he does so, but he should repent of them before the Almighty, blessed be He, declaring in detail his sins before Him, and make public confession in general terms; and it is well for him that his iniquity has not become known, as it is said, &#x201C;Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered&#x201D; (Ps. 32:1).</p>
<p>6. VIII. Although repentance and supplication are always good, they are particularly so and are immediately accepted during the ten days intervening between the New Year and the Day of Atonement, as it is said, &#x201C;Seek the Lord while He may be found&#x201D; (Is. 55:6). This only applies, however, to an individual. But as for a community, whenever its members repent and offer supplications with sincere hearts, they are answered, as it is said, &#x201C;For what great nation is there that hath God so nigh unto them, as the Lord, our God, whensoever we call to Him&#x201D; (Deut. 4:7).</p>
<p>7. IX. The Day of Atonement is the time of repentance for all, for the individual as well as for the multitude. It is the goal of the penitential season, appointed unto Israel for pardon and forgiveness. Hence, all are under the obligation of repenting and making confession on the Day of Atonement. The duty of confession, on the Day of Atonement, requires that a person should begin to make his confession already on the previous day, before he takes his meal, lest he choke (while he is eating) without having confessed. And notwithstanding that he had already made confession, he confesses again on the night of the Day of Atonement, during the evening service, and again in the morning service, additional, afternoon and concluding services. At which part of the service is the confession made ? It is recited by the individual after the <italic>Amidah;</italic> by the reader of the congregation, during the <italic>Amidah</italic>, in its fourth blessing.</p>
<p>8. X. The formula of confession adopted by all Israel is the sentence &#x201C;Verily we have sinned&#x201D;. This is the essence of the confession. Transgressions, confessed on one Day of Atonement, are again confessed on the next Day of Atonement, even if one has continued penitent, as it is said, &#x201C;For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me&#x201D; (Ps. 51:5).</p>
<p>9. XI. Repentance and the Day of Atonement only secure forgiveness for transgressions against God; as, for example, when one has partaken of forbidden food or indulged in illicit intercourse, and so forth. But transgressions against one&#x2019;s fellow-men, as for instance, if one wounds, curses or robs his neighbour or commits similar wrongs, are never pardoned till the injured party has received the compensation due to him and has also been appeased. XII. Even though he has made the compensation, the wrongdoer must also appease the one he has injured and ask his forgiveness. Even if a person only annoyed another in words, he has to pacify the latter and entreat him till he has obtained his forgiveness. XIII. If however, the injured party is unwilling to forgive, he should bring three of his friends at one time, and they should entreat the person offended, and solicit his pardon. If they fail, he should take with him a second and even a third group. If the offended person continues obdurate, he leaves him alone and goes away. The one who refused to forgive is now the sinner. But if the offended person was the offender&#x2019;s teacher, the pupil has to go to him again and again, even a thousand times, till pardon has been granted.</p>
<p>10. XIV. It is forbidden to be obdurate and not allow oneself to be appeased. On the contrary one should be easily pacified and find it difficult to become angry. And, when asked by an offender for forgiveness, one should forgive with a sincere mind and willing spirit. Even if one had been much vexed and grievously wronged, he is not to avenge nor bear a grudge. Forgiveness is natural to the seed of Israel, characteristic of their upright heart. Not so are the hard-hearted heathens. &#x201C;His resentment keeps for ever&#x201D; (Amos 1:11). Thus, of the Gibeonites who did not forgive and refused to be appeased, it is said, &#x201C;Now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel&#x201D; (II Sam. 21:2).</p>
<p>11. XV. If a person sinned against another and the latter died before pardon was sought, the sinner should bring ten men, station them at the grave of the deceased, and, in their presence, make the declaration: &#x201C;I sinned against the Lord, God of Israel and against this individual, having committed such and such a wrong against him&#x201D;. If he owed the deceased money, he should pay it to the heirs. If he did not know of any heirs, he should deposit the amount in Court, and make confession.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER III.</h1>
<p>1. Every human being has merits and iniquities. One whose merits exceed his iniquities is righteous. He whose iniquities exceed his merits is wicked. If the two balance in an individual, he belongs to the intermediate class. II. So it is with a country. If the merits of all its inhabitants exceed their iniquities, the country is righteous. If their iniquities preponderate, it is a wicked country. So too is it with regard to the whole of the world.</p>
<p>2. III. A person whose iniquities exceed his merits perishes forthwith in his wickedness, as it is said, &#x201C;For the multitude of thy iniquity&#x201D; (Hosea. 9:7). So too, a country, the iniquities of whose inhabitants preponderate, perishes forthwith, as it is said, &#x201C;the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah, because it is great&#x201D; (Gen. 18:20). So, with the entire world, if the iniquities of its human population exceed their merits, they are destroyed forthwith, as it is said, &#x201C;And the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth&#x201D; (Gen. 6:5). IV. This valuation takes into account not the number but the magnitude of merits and iniquities. There may be a single merit that outweighs many iniquities, as it is said, &#x201C;Because in him there is found some good thing&#x201D; (I. Kings 14:13). And there may be one iniquity that counterbalances many merits, as it is said &#x201C;But one sinner<xref rid="fn144">&#x002A;</xref> destroyeth much good&#x201D; (Eccles. 9:19). The valuation is according to the knowledge of the Omniscient God. He alone knows how to set off merit against iniquities.</p>
<p>3. V. Whoever regrets the precepts that he had fulfilled and wonders at his meritorious deeds, saying to himself, &#x2018;What profit have I of them ? Would that I had not done them&#x2019;, forfeits the credit for all of them, and none of his meritorious deeds is ever remembered in his favour, as it is said&#x201E; &#x201C;The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him on the day of his transgression&#x201D; (Ezek. 33:12); that is, if he regrets his former good deeds. VI. And even as a man&#x2019;s meritorious deeds and iniquities are balanced at the hour of death, so are the iniquities of every single inhabitant of the Earth weighed against his merits annually on the New Year Feast. He who is found righteous is sealed unto life; he who is found wicked is sealed unto death. If one belongs to the intermediate class, sentence on him is suspended till the Day of Atonement. If he repents, he is sealed unto life; if he does not do so, he is sealed unto death.</p>
<p>4. VII. Although the Sounding of the Shofar on the New Year is a decree of Holy Writ<xref rid="fn145">&#x002A;</xref>, still it has a deep meaning, as if saying, &#x201C;Awake, awake, O sleepers, from your sleep; O slumberers, arouse ye from your slumbers; and examine your deeds, return in repentance, and remember your Creator. Those of you who forget the truth in the follies of the times and go astray, the whole year, in vanity and emptiness, which neither profit nor save, look to your souls; improve your ways and works. Abandon, everyone of you, his evil course and the thought that is not good&#x201D;. VIII. It is necessary therefore that every one, throughout the year, should regard himself as if he were half innocent and half guilty; and should regard the whole of mankind as half innocent and half guilty. If then he commits one more sin, he presses down the scale of guilt against himself and the whole world and causes his destruction. If he fulfills one commandment, he turns the scale of merit in his favour and in that of the whole world, and brings salvation and deliverance to all his fellow-creatures and to himself, as it is said, &#x201C;the righteous man is the foundation of the world&#x201D; (Prov. 10:25); that is to say, that he who acts justly presses down the scale of merit in favour of all the world and saves it. IX. And because of these considerations, the whole house of Israel have the custom to increase their charities and other good deeds from the New Year to the Day of Atonement and engage in religious duties at this period to a larger extent than during the rest of the year. So too, during these ten days, all rise up while it is still night, and pray in the synagogues till dawn, with fervent entreaties and supplications.</p>
<p>5. X. When a person&#x2019;s iniquities and merits are weighed, the first offence that he committed is not counted, nor yet the second. The reckoning starts from the third offence. And if his iniquities, from the third onwards, are found to exceed his merits, the first two sins are also included in the demerits and he is judged for all of them. XI. But if his merits and iniquities&#x2014;counting from the third offence&#x2014;are found to balance, then all his iniquities are cancelled, one after another. The third is regarded as if it had been the first, the first two having already been forgiven. Then the fourth is regarded as if it had been the first, the third having been forgiven; and so on to the last. XII. This applies to an individual, as it is said, &#x201C;Lo, all these things does God do; twice, yea, thrice with a man&#x201D; (Job. 33:29). As to a community, (punishment for) their first offence as will as for their second and third, is suspended, as it is said &#x201C;For three transgressions of Israel,&#x2014;yea, for four, I will not reverse it&#x201D; (Amos. 2:6). When account is taken of the merits and demerits of a community, their sins are reckoned from the fourth onwards, after the manner already described. XIII. As to those who belong to the intermediate class, if among half of an individual&#x2019;s deeds which constitute offences there is included the sin of never having put on phylacteries,<xref rid="fn146">&#x002A;</xref> he is judged according to his sins but will have a portion in the world to come. So too, all wicked persons whose iniquities exceed their merits are judged according to their sins and have a portion in the world to come; for all Israelites, notwithstanding that they have sinned, have a portion in the life hereafter, as it is said, &#x201C;Thy people shall all be righteous, they shall inherit the land for ever&#x201D; (Isaiah. 60:21). The expression <italic>land</italic> is a metaphor for the land of life, that is, the world to come. And so too, the saints among the gentile peoples have a portion in the world to come.</p>
<p>6. XIV. The following have no portion in the world to come, but are cut off and perish, and for their great wickedness and sinfulness are condemned for ever and ever. Heretics and Epicureans;<xref rid="fn147">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> those who deny the Torah, the resurrection of the dead or the coming of the Redeemer; apostates; those who cause a multitude to sin, and those who secede from the ways of the community; any one who commits transgressions like Jehoiakim, in high handed fashion and openly; informers; those who terrorise a community, not for a religious purpose; murderers and slanderers, and one who obliterates the physical mark of his Jewish origin.</p>
<p>7. XV. Five Classes are termed Heretics; he who says that there is no God and the world has no ruler; he who says that there is a ruling power but that it is vested in two or more persons; he who says there is one ruler, but that He is a body and has form; he who denies that He alone is the First Cause and Rock of the Universe; likewise, he who renders worship to any one beside Him, to serve as a mediator between the human being and the Lord of the Universe. Whoever belongs to any of these five classes is termed a heretic.</p>
<p>8. XVI. Three Classes are called Epicureans:<xref rid="fn147">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> he who denies the reality of prophecy and maintains that there is no knowledge which emanates from the Creator and directly reaches the human mind; he who denies the prophecy of Moses, our teacher; and he who asserts that the Creator has no cognizance of the deeds of the children of men. Each of these classes consists of Epicureans. XVII. Three Classes are deniers of the Torah; he who says that the Torah is not of divine origin&#x2014;even if he says of one verse, or of a single word, that Moses said it, of himself,<xref rid="fn148">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref>&#x2014;is a denier of the Torah; likewise, he who denies its interpretation, that is, the Oral Law, and repudiates its reporters, as Zadok and Boethus did; he who says that the Creator changed one commandment for another, and that this Torah, although of divine origin, is now obsolete, as the Nazarenes and Moslems assert. Everyone belonging to any of these classes is a denier of the Torah.</p>
<p>9. XVIII. There are two classes of apostates&#x2014;an apostate with respect to the violation of a single precept, and an apostate with respect to the whole Torah. The former is a person who has determined to violate a certain precept, commits the transgression habitually and has become notorious for it. Even if it is one of the lighter sins, as, for instance, if a person wears garments &#x201C;of diverse sorts&#x201D; (a mixture of wool and flax) (Deut. 22:11) or &#x201C;rounds the corner of his head&#x201D; (Lev. 19:27), doing so habitually, so that it appears that the precept is regarded by him as no longer binding, he is an apostate in regard to that particular observance, provided that he acted in a provocative spirit. An apostate with respect to the whole Torah is one, for example, who at a time of religious persecution becomes converted to the idolaters&#x2019; religion, clings to them, saying, &#x201C;what advantage is it to me to adhere to the people of Israel, who are of low estate and persecuted. Better for me to join these nations who are powerful.&#x201D; A person who acts thus is an apostate in respect to the whole Torah.</p>
<p>10. XIX. Those who cause the multitude to sin, include one who induces others to sin, whether in a great matter, like Jeroboam, Zadok and Boethus, or in a light matter, even if he only induces them to nullify the observance of an affirmative precept; and any one who coerces others to sin, like Manasseh who put Israelites to death and so forced the people into idolatry; or deceives others and leads them astray.</p>
<p>11. XX. One who separates himself from the Community, even if he does not commit a transgression but only holds aloof from the congregation of Israel, does not fulfill religious precepts in common with his people, shows himself indifferent when they are in distress, does not observe their fast, but goes his own way, as if he were one of the gentiles and did not belong to the Jewish people&#x2014;such a person has no portion in the world to come. XXI. He, who, like Jehoiakim, commits transgressions arrogantly, whether these are light or grave offences, has no portion in the world to come. Such a one is called a shameless transgressor, because he exhibits effrontery and shamelessness and is unabashed by the words of the Torah.</p>
<p>12. XXII. There are two classes of informers: one who delivers a coreligionist into the power of a heathen, who will put him to death or assault him; and one who delivers the property of a coreligionist to a heathen or to a despot, who is like a heathen. Both classes of informers have no portion in the world to come.</p>
<p>13. XXIII. The terrorisers of a community, not for the sake of God, are those who rule a congregation arbitrarily so that all fear and are afraid of them&#x2014;their aim, like that of the heathen kings, being to advance their own glory and interests but not to promote the glory of God.</p>
<p>14. XXIV. All these twenty four classes which we have enumerated, even if they are Israelites, have no portion in the world to come. There are transgressions less grave than those mentioned, concerning which, however, the sages said that whoever habitually commits them will have no portion in the world to come. One should therefore avoid, and beware of such transgressors. XXV. They are one who gives another a nickname, calls another by his nickname, puts him to shame in public, seeks honour by another person&#x2019;s humiliation, contemns scholars or one&#x2019;s teachers, treats the festivals with contempt, desecrates things sacred. XXVI. When it is said that one who commits any of these sins has no portion in the world to come, the statement is to be understood as only applying to the sinner who dies impenitent. But if he repented of his wickedness and expired while still penitent, he is of those who will have a portion in the world to come; for there is nothing that stands in the way of repentance. Even if a person, throughout his life, denied the essential principle of religion and repented at the end, he will have a portion in the world to come; as it is said &#x201C;Peace, Peace to him that is far off and to him that is near, saith the Lord, and I will heal him&#x201D; (Is. 57:19). XXVII. All wicked persons, transgressors, apostates and the like, who come back penitent, whether openly or secretly, are accepted, as it is said, &#x201C;Return, ye backsliding children&#x201D; (Jer. 3:22). Even if one is still a backslider&#x2014;since he only returns in secret and not openly&#x2014;he is accepted if he repents.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IV.</h1>
<p>1. Twenty-four things hinder repentance. Four of them constitute grave offences. If one commits any of them, the Holy One, blessed be He, does not give him an opportunity to repent because of the enormity of his sin. Such sinners are the following: 1) He who leads a community to sin, and under this category comes one who prevents a community from fulfilling a religious duty; 2) he who turns his fellow-man from the good to the evil way, as, for instance, the seducer and the enticer (Deut. 13:3); 3) he who sees his son falling into vicious courses and does not check him. As the son is under his father&#x2019;s control, had the latter checked him, he would have renounced his evil course; hence, the father is considered to have induced his son to sin. Included in this category is any one who is able to check others,&#x2014;an individual or a community&#x2014;and does not do so, but permits them to stumble; 4) he who says, &#x201C;I will sin and then repent&#x201D;. Included in this category is he who says, &#x201C;I will sin, and the Day of Atonement will secure my forgiveness&#x201D;.</p>
<p>2. II. Among those (twenty-four things), there are five offences which close the ways of repentance to those who commit them. Such sinners are the following: 1) He who separates himself from the community, because, when they repent, he will not be with them, and will therefore have no part in the merit they acquire; 2) he who opposes the <italic>dicta</italic> of the sages, because his opposition induces him to separate himself from them and he will consequently remain in ignorance of the ways of repentance; 3) he who makes mock of the divine precepts, for, since in his eyes they are contemptible, he will not eagerly seek them nor fulfil them; and if he does not fulfil them, how can he acquire merit ? 4) He who contemns his teachers; for such conduct will lead to his being thrust forth and expelled, as happened to Gehazi (II. Kings 5:27); and when he is expelled, he will find no one to teach him and show him the way of truth; 5) he who hates rebukes, since he does not leave himself a way to return, for it is rebuke that brings about repentance. When a person is told of his faults and is put to shame on their account, he repents, as it is written in the Torah, &#x201C;Remember, do not forget&#x2026;. ye have been rebellious&#x201D; (Deut. 9:7); &#x201C;But the Lord hath not given you a heart to understand&#x201D; ((Deut. 29:3); &#x201C;O foolish people and unwise&#x201D; (Deut. 32:6). III.<xref rid="fn149">&#x002A;</xref> Thus too, Isaiah rebuked Israel and said, &#x201C;O sinful nation&#x201D;&#x2026;.. (Is. 1:4); &#x201C;The ox knoweth his owner&#x2026;&#x2026;&#x201D; (Is. 1:3); &#x201C;Because I know that thou art obstinate&#x201D; (Is. 48:4). And indeed God commanded him to rebuke sinners, as it is said, &#x201C;Cry aloud, spare not&#x201D; (Is. 58:1). Thus too, all the prophets rebuked Israel till they repented. Hence it is necessary to appoint in every community a great scholar, advanced in years, God-fearing from his youth and beloved by the people, to rebuke the multitude and cause them to repent. But he who hates rebukes will not go to the exhorter nor hear his words, and will therefore persist in his sins which seem good in his eyes.</p>
<p>3. IV. Among those (twenty four things), there are five offences of such a nature that he who commits them cannot possibly return in perfect repentance, because they are sins against one&#x2019;s fellow-man and the sinner does not know to whom he has to make restitution, or of whom he has to ask pardon. Sinners of this class are the following: 1) He who curses a multitude, and not an individual of whom he might ask forgiveness; 2) he who shares with a thief, since he does not know who is the owner of the stolen property, the thief stealing from many persons and bringing him the stolen articles which he receives; furthermore, because the receiver encourages the thief and induces him to sin; 3) he who finds lost property and does not proclaim it, so as to restore it to its owner; after a time, when he repents, he does not know whom to restore it to; 4) he who despoils the poor, orphans or widows; for these people are in a pitiable condition, they are not well known, they emigrate from one city to another where they have no acquaintance, so that the wrongdoer cannot ascertain to whom the despoiled goods belong and should be restored; 5) he who takes bribes to prevert judgment; since he does not know how far his judgment has been perverted, nor the full extent of the consequences, so that he might make amends, for he will find excuses<xref rid="fn150">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> for his conduct; furthermore, because he encourages the bribing ligitant and causes him to sin.</p>
<p>4. V. Among those (twenty-four sins), there are five, concerning which it may be assumed that he who commits them will not repent of them; the reason being that they are regarded by most people as trivial, with the result that one sins and imagines that it is no sin. Offenders coming under this category are the following: 1) He who partakes of a meal that is insufficient for its owner. This is a minor<xref rid="fn151">&#x002A;&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> form of robbery; yet the guest imagines that he has not sinned and says (to himself) &#x201C;Did I eat aught without the owner&#x2019;s consent ?&#x201D; 2) he who uses a poor man&#x2019;s pledge. A poor man&#x2019;s pledge consists only of such articles as an axe or a plow, and the user says to himself: &#x201C;the articles have not been diminished; I have not robbed him&#x201D;. 3) he who gazes at women whom it would be unlawful for him to marry, thinks that there is nothing wrong in it, and says to himself, &#x201C;Have I cohabited with her, or even drawn near to her ?&#x201D;&#x2014;and does not realise that the (lustful) look is a grave sin, for it leads to actual inchastity, as it is said, &#x201C;And that ye seek not after your heart and after your eyes&#x201D; (Num. 15:39). 4) he who seeks to obtain honour by disparaging another person and thinks to himself that this is no sin, since the other person is not present and has not suffered any shame. Moreover, the speaker did not actually shame him but only compared his own good deeds and wisdom with the other person&#x2019;s deeds or wisdom, so that it might be inferred that he himself is an honourable man, while the other is a contemptible fellow. 5) he who suspects the innocent, thinks to himself that he is not comitting a sin, and says, &#x2018;what have I done to him? Is there on my part anything more than a suspicion as to whether that person has done something or not ?&#x2019; He does not however, realise that it is an iniquity, to regard a blameless man as possibly a transgressor.</p>
<p>5. VI.<xref rid="fn152">&#x002A;</xref> Belonging to the group, are five offences of such a nature that he who commits them will always be addicted to them and will find it hard to break away from them. Hence, a person should be on his guard lest he become habituated to them, seeing that they are all exceedingly pernicious habits. They are as follows: &#x201C;Tale-bearing, Evil Speech, Choleric Temper, Evil Thoughts; keeping company with a wicked person, for thus one learns his ways which become impressed on the heart. So Solomon said: &#x201C;But the companion of fools shall be broken&#x201D; (Prov. 13:20). In the laws dealing with moral dispositions, we have put together the qualities that all men should cultivate; how much more then, should the penitent do so.</p>
<p>6. All offences enumerated above and their like, though they hinder repentance, do not prevent it. If a person repents of them, he is accepted as a penitent, and will have a portion in the world to come.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER V.</h1>
<p>1. Free Will is bestowed on every human being. If one desires to turn towards the good way and be righteous, he has the power to do so. If one wishes to turn towards the evil way and be wicked, he is at liberty to do so. And thus is it written in the Torah, &#x201C;Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil&#x201D; (Gen. 3:22)&#x2014;which means that the human species had become unique in the world&#x2014;there being no other species like it in the following respect, namely, that man, of himself and by the exercise of his own intelligence and reason, knows what is good and what is evil, and there is none who can prevent him from doing that which is good or that which is evil. And since this is so (there is reason to fear) &#x201C;lest he put forth his hand etc.&#x201D; (ibid.).</p>
<p>2. II. Let not the notion, expressed by foolish gentiles and most of the senseless folk among Israelites, pass through your mind that at the beginning of a person&#x2019;s existence, the Almighty decrees that he is to be either righteous or wicked. This is not so. Every human being may become righteous like Moses, our teacher, or wicked like Jeroboam; wise or foolish, merciful or cruel; niggardly or generous; and so with all other qualities. III. There is no one that coerces him or decrees what he is to do, or draws him to either of the two ways; but every person turns to the way which he desires, spontaneously and of his own volition. Thus Jeremiah said, &#x201C;out of the mouth of the Most High, proceedeth not evil and good&#x201D; (Lam. 3:38); that is to say, the Creator does not decree either that a man shall be good or that he shall be wicked. IV. Accordingly it follows that it is the sinner who has inflicted injury on himself; and he should therefore weep for, and bewail what he has done to his soul&#x2014;how he has mistreated it. This is expressed in the next verse, &#x201C;Wherefore doth a living man complain, a strong man, because of his sins&#x201D; (Lam. 3:39). The prophet continues: since liberty of action is in our hands and we have, of our free will, committed all these evils, it behoves us to return in a spirit of repentance, and forsake our wickedness, for we have the power to do so. This thought is expressed in the next verse, &#x201C;Let us search and try our ways, and return to the Lord&#x201D; (Lam. 3.40).</p>
<p>3. V. This doctrine is an important principle, the pillar of the Law and the Commandment, as it is said, &#x201C;see, I set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil&#x201D; (Deut. 30:15); and again it is written, &#x2018;Behold, I set before you this day, a blessing and a curse&#x201D; (Deut. 11:26). This means that the power is in your hands, and whatever a man desires to do among the things that human beings do, he can do, whether they are good or evil; and, because of this faculty, it is said, &#x201C;O that they had such a heart as this always&#x201D; (Deut. 5:26), which implies that the Creator neither puts compulsion on the children of men nor decrees that they should do either good, or evil, but it is all left to their discretion.</p>
<p>4. VI. If God had decreed that a person should be either righteous or wicked, or if there were some force inherent in his nature which irresistibly drew him to a particular course, or to a special branch of knowledge, to special views or activities, as the foolish astrologers, out of their own fancy, pretend, how would the Almighty have charged us, through the prophets: &#x2018;Do this and do not do that, improve your ways, do not follow your wicked impulses&#x2019;, when, from the beginning of his existence, his destiny had already been decreed, or his innate constitution irresistibly drew him to that from which he could not set himself free ? What room would there be for the whole of the Torah ? By what right or justice could God punish the wicked or reward the righteous ? &#x201C;Shall not the Judge of all the earth act justly?&#x201D; (Gen. 18:25). VII. Do not, however, wonder: how can a man do whatever he desires, and act according to his discretion? Can aught in the world be done without the Master&#x2019;s Will and pleasure ? The Scripture itself says, &#x201C;Whatsoever the Lord pleased, that hath He done in heaven and on earth&#x201D; (Ps. 135:6). Know then that everything takes place according to His pleasure, notwithstanding that our acts are in our power. VIII. How so ? Just as it was the pleasure of the Creator that fire and air shall ascend, earth and water descend, and that the sphere shall revolve in a circle, and all other things in the Universe shall exist in their special ways which He desired, so it was His pleasure that Man should have liberty of will, and all his acts should be left to his discretion; that nothing should coerce him or draw him to aught, but that, of himself and by the exercise of his own mind which God had given him, he should do whatever it is in a man&#x2019;s power to do. IX. Hence, he is judged according to his deeds. If he does well, good is done to him; and if he does ill, evil is done to him. So the prophet says, &#x201C;This hath been of your doing&#x201D; (Mal. 1:9): &#x201C;Yea, they have chosen their own ways&#x201D; (Is. 66:3). On this theme Solomon said, &#x201C;Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth&#x2026;. but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment&#x201D; (Eccles. 11:9); that is to say, realise that what you do is in your power, and that you will have to render an account.</p>
<p>5. X. Perchance you will say, &#x201C;Does not the Almighty know everything that will be before it happens&#x201D;? He either knows that this person will be righteous or wicked, or He does not know. If He knows that he will be righteous, it is impossible that he should not be righteous; and if you say that He knows that he will be righteous and yet it is possible for him to be wicked, then He does not know the matter clearly. XI. As to the solution of this problem, understand that &#x201C;the measure thereof is longer than the earth and wider than the sea&#x201D; (Job. 11:9), and many important principles of the highest sublimity are connected with it. You, however, need only to know and comprehend what I am about to say. XII. In the Second Chapter of the laws relating to the fundamental principles of the Torah, we have already explained that God does not know with a knowledge external to Himself, like human beings whose knowledge and self are separate entities, but He, blessed be His Name, and His knowledge are One. This, the human intellect cannot clearly apprehend. And just as it is not in human power to apprehend or discover the Creator&#x2019;s Real Essence, as it is said, &#x201C;For there shall no man see Me and live&#x201D; (Ex. 33:20), so it is not in human power to apprehend or discover the Creator&#x2019;s knowledge. So the prophet said, &#x201C;For My thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways My ways&#x201D; (Is. 55:8). This being the case, we lack the capacity to know how God knows all creatures and their activities. XIII. Yet we do know beyond doubt that a human being&#x2019;s activities are in his own hands and the Almighty neither draws him on, nor decrees that he should act thus or not act thus. It is not religious tradition alone by which this is known. It is also supported by clear proofs furnished by science. Hence, it is said in the Prophetic writings that a man will be judged for all his deeds, according to his deeds, whether they be good or evil. And this is the principle on which all the words of Prophecy depend.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VI.</h1>
<p>1. There are many verses in the Pentateuch and in the Prophets which seem to contradict this fundamental doctrine. And they lead most people astray and make them think that God decrees that a person shall do good or evil, and that a man&#x2019;s heart is not under his control, to incline him in whichever direction he pleases. I will therefore expound an important principle by which you will learn the meaning of those verses. II. When an individual sins or the inhabitants of a country sin, and the sinner commits an offence, consciously and voluntarily, as above stated, it is proper that he be punished. God knows the way in which punishment should be exacted. In the case of some sins, justice requires that the sinner should be punished for his sin in this world, corporally or pecuniarily or through his little children; for a man&#x2019;s little children, who have as yet no understanding and have not arrived at the age of religious obligation, are their father&#x2019;s quasi-property, and the text &#x201C;Every man<xref rid="fn153">&#x002A;</xref> shall be put to death for his own sin&#x201D; (Deut. 24:16) implies that one is not personally liable till he is an adult. III. Again, there are sins where justice requires that the punishment be inflicted in the life hereafter and the transgressor suffers no hurt here on earth. Other sins again there are, for which the penalty is exacted here and hereafter.</p>
<p>2. The foregoing only applies in case the sinner has not repented. But if he repented, repentance serves as a shield against punishment. And as one sins, prompted by one&#x2019;s own mind and of his free will, so one repents, prompted by one&#x2019;s mind and will.</p>
<p>3. IV. A man may commit so great a sin or such numerous sins that justice requires of the true judge, as the penalty to be exacted from this particular sinner for the sins, committed by him voluntarily and of his own mind, that repentance shall be withheld from him and liberty to turn from his wickedness shall not be accorded him, so that he may die and perish in the sins which he committed. So God saith through Isaiah, &#x201C;Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and close their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn and be healed&#x201D; (Is. 6:10); and thus it is said, &#x201C;But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised His words, and scoffed at His prophets, until the wrath of the Lord arose against His people, till there was no remedy&#x201D; (II. Book of Chron. 36:16). This means that they sinned, of their own will, and multiplied transgressions to such an extent that they incurred the penalty of having repentance, which is the remedy for sin, withheld from them. V. Hence also, it is written in the Pentateuch, &#x201C;And I will harden Pharaoh&#x2019;s heart&#x201D; (Ex. 4:21). Because Pharaoh sinned on his own impulse and ill-treated the Israelites who sojourned in his land, as is said &#x201C;Come let us deal wisely with them&#x2026;.&#x201D; (Ex. 1:10), justice required that repentance should be withheld from him till retribution had been visited upon him. The Holy One, blessed be He, accordingly hardened his heart. VI. But why did He send him a message through Moses, bidding him &#x2018;release the Israelites and repent&#x2019;, when He had already told him &#x2018;thou wilt not release them&#x2019;, as it is said, &#x201C;But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not fear the Lord God&#x201D; (Ex. 9:30), &#x201C;But in very deed for this cause have I made thee to stand, (to show thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth)&#x201D; (Ex. 9:16)? The purpose was to instruct the inhabitants of the world<xref rid="fn154">&#x002A;</xref> that when the Almighty withholds repentance from the sinner, he cannot return, but will die in his wickedness which he had originally committed of his own will. VII. So Sihon, because of his iniquities, incurred the penalty of having repentance withheld from him, as it is said, &#x201C;for the Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that He might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day&#x201D; (Deut. 2:30). Thus too, because of the Canaanites&#x2019; abominations, God withheld repentance from them till they waged war against Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;For it was of the Lord to harden their hearts, to come against Israel, in battle, that they might be utterly destroyed&#x201D; Josh. 11:20). So with the Israelites in the days of Elijah; because they transgressed much, God withheld repentance from those who multiplied their transgressions, as it is said, &#x201C;For thou didst turn their heart backward&#x201D; (I. Kings 18:37); this means &#x2018;Thou has withheld repentance from them&#x2019;. VIII. To sum up, God did not decree that Pharaoh should ill-treat Israel, or Sihon sin in his land, or that the Canaanites should commit abominations, or that Israel should worship idols. All of them sinned by their own volition; and all accordingly incurred the penalty that repentance should be withheld from them.</p>
<p>4. IX. And thus the prophets and the righteous beseech the Almighty, in their prayers, to help them to the way of truth, as David said, &#x201C;Teach me, O Lord, thy way&#x201D;, (Ps. 86:11); that is, &#x2018;May my sins not keep the way of truth from me, that I may learn from it Thy way and the Unity of Thy Name&#x2019;. So also his prayer, &#x201C;let a noble spirit uphold me&#x201D; (Ps. 51:14) means, &#x2018;Suffer my spirit to accomplish its desire, and may not my sins cause repentance to be withheld from me, but let me have liberty, till I return and understand and know the way of truth&#x2019;. Every text similar to the above can be explained in the same way.</p>
<p>5. X. What is meant by David&#x2019;s utterance, &#x201C;Good and upright is the Lord; therefore He will teach sinners in the way; He will guide the meek in judgment and will teach the meek His way&#x201D; (Ps. 25:8)? It refers to the fact that God sent them prophets to teach them the ways of the Lord and bring them back in repentance; furthermore, that He endowed them with the capacity of learning and understanding. For it is characteristic of every human being that, when his interest is engaged in the ways of wisdom and righteousness, he longs for these ways and is eager to follow them. Thus the sages say, &#x201C;Whoever comes to purify himself receives aid&#x201D;; that is, he will find himself helped in his endeavour. XI. But is it not written in the Torah &#x201C;And they shall serve them, and they shall afflict them&#x201D; (Gen. 15:13)? Did not then the Almighty decree that the Egyptians should do evil ? It is also written, &#x201C;And this people will rise up and go astray after the foreign gods of the land&#x201D; (Deut. 31:16). Did He not decree that Israel should worship idols ? Why then did He punish them ? (The answer is) that He did not decree concerning any particular individual that that individual should be the one to go astray. Any one of those who went astray and worshipped idols, had he not desired to commit idolatry, need not have done so. The Creator only instructed Moses as to what the future course of history would be, as one might say, &#x2018;This people will have among them righteous and wicked persons&#x2019;. A wicked man has no right, on that account, to say that it had been decreed that he should be wicked, because the Almighty had informed Moses that among Israel there would be wicked men, just as the text, &#x201C;For the poor shall never cease out of the land&#x201D; (Deut. 15:11) (does not imply that any particular individual is destined to be poor). XII. So too with the Egyptians: Every one of those Egyptians who oppressed and ill-treated the Israelites could have refrained from doing so, had he not wished to hurt them. For God did not make a decree concerning any specific individual but only informed Abraham that his seed would be subjected to servitude in a land that was not theirs. We have already stated that it is beyond human power to understand the way in which God has cognizance of future events.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VII.</h1>
<p>1. Since every human being, as we have explained, has free will, a man should strive to repent, (make verbal confession of his sins<xref rid="fn155">&#x002A;</xref>) and renounce them, so that he may die penitent and thus be worthy of life in the world to come.</p>
<p>2. II. A man should always regard himself as if his death were iminent and think that he may die this very hour, while still in a state of sin. He should therefore repent of his sins immediately and not say, &#x2018;When I grow old I shall repent&#x2019;, for he may die before he becomes old. So Solomon, in his wisdom, said, &#x201C;Let thy garments be always white, and oil on thy head not be lacking&#x201D; (Eccles. 9:8).</p>
<p>3. III. Do not say that one need only repent of sinful deeds such as fornication, robbery and theft. Just as a man needs to repent of these sins involving acts, so he needs to investigate and repent of any evil dispositions that he may have, such as hot temper, hatred, jealousy, quarrelling,<xref rid="fn156">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> scoffing, eager pursuit of wealth or honours, greediness in eating, and so on. Of all these faults one should repent. They are graver than sinful acts; for, when one is addicted to them it is difficult to give them up. And thus it is said, &#x201C;Let the wicked forsake his way and the man of iniquity his thoughts&#x201D; (Is. 55:7).</p>
<p>4. IV. Let not the penitent suppose that he is kept far away from the degree attained by the righteous, because of the iniquities and sins that he had committed. This is not so. He is beloved by the Creator, desired by Him, as if he had never sinned. Moreover his reward is great; since, though having tasted sin, he renounced it and overcame his evil passions. The sages say, &#x201C;Where penitents stand, the completely righteous cannot stand&#x201D;. This means, that the degree attained by penitents is higher than that of those who had never sinned, the reason being that the former have had to put forth a greater effort to subdue their passions than the latter.</p>
<p>5. V. All the prophets charged the people concerning repentance. Only through repentance will Israel be redeemed, and the Torah already offered the assurance that Israel will, in the closing period of his exile, finally repent, and thereupon be immediately redeemed, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thee, and thou shalt take it to heart among all the nations, whither the Lord, thy God hath driven thee, and shalt return unto the Lord, thy God, and hearken to His voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, that the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have mercy upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all the nations, whither the Lord, thy God, hath scattered thee&#x201D; (Deut. 30:1-3).</p>
<p>6. VI. Great is repentance, for it brings men near to the Divine Presence, as it is said, &#x201C;Return, O Israel, unto the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Hos. 14:2). Again, it is said, &#x201C;And ye have not returned unto Me, saith the Lord&#x201D; (Amos 4:6). Further, &#x201C;If thou return, O Israel, to Me shalt thou return&#x201D; (Jer. 4:1), which means &#x2018;If thou returnest in repentance, thou wilt cleave to Me&#x2019;. VII. Repentance brings near those who are far away. But yesterday this person was odious before God, abhorred, estranged, an abomination. To-day he is beloved, desirable, near (to God), a friend. So you find that the same expression with which God thrusts sinners away from Him, He employs to bring the penitent near to Him, whether they are individuals or communities, as it is said, &#x201C;And instead of that which was said unto them: &#x2018;Ye are not my people&#x2019;, it shall be said unto them: &#x2018;Ye are children of the living God&#x2019; &#x201D; (Hos. 2:1). Of Jeconiah, while he was wicked, it was said, &#x201C;Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days&#x201D; (Jer. 22:30); &#x201C;Though Coniah, the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, were a signet upon my right hand, (yet would I pluck thee thence)&#x201D; (Jer. 22:24). But after he had in his exile repented, it is said of his son, Zerubbabel, &#x201C;In that day, saith the Lord of Hosts, will I take thee, O Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant, and will make thee as a signet, saith the Lord of hosts&#x201D; (Haggai 2:23).</p>
<p>7. VIII. How exalted is the degree of repentance ? But last night a certain individual was separated from the Lord, God of Israel, as it is said, &#x201C;Your iniquities were making a separation between you and your God&#x201D; (Is. 59:2). He cries aloud and is not answered, as it is said, &#x201C;Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear&#x201D; (Is. 1:15). He fulfils religious precepts and they are flung back in his face, as it is said, &#x201C;who hath required this at your hand to tread my courts?&#x201D; (Is. 1:12); &#x201C;Oh that there were even one among you that would shut the doors, that ye might not kindle fire on my altar in vain; I have no pleasure in you, saith the Lord of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand&#x201D; (Malachi 1:10); &#x201C;Add your burnt offerings unto your sacrifice and eat flesh&#x201D; (Jer. 7:21). IX. Today, the same individual (having repented) is closely attached to the Divine Presence, as it is said, &#x201C;And ye that cleave unto the Lord, your God, are alive, everyone of you this day&#x201D; (Deut. 4:4). He cries and is immediately answered, as it is said, &#x201C;And it shall come to pass that before they call I will answer&#x201D; (Is. 65:24). He fulfils religious precepts tnd they are accepted with pleasure and with joy, as it is said, &#x201C;For God hath already accepted thy works&#x201D; (Eccles. 9:7). Yet more, they are eagerly desired, as it is said, &#x201C;Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant to the Lord as in the days of old and as in ancient years&#x201D; (Malachi 3:4).</p>
<p>8. X. The right way for penitents is to be exceedingly humble and meek. If fools taunt them with their former deeds and say to them, &#x2018;But last night thou didst act thus and thus; last night, thou wast saying this and that&#x2019;, they should not be unpleasantly affected by them, but should listen and rejoice, realizing that this will be accounted a merit unto them. For when they are ashamed of their past deeds and humiliated because of them, their merit is increased and their worth enhanced. XI. It is however a grievous sin to say to a penitent &#x2018;Remember thy former doings&#x2019;, or to recall them in his presence, so as to shame him, or refer to similar incidents or topics, in order to remind him of what he had done. All this is forbidden and comes under the category of vexing another in words, against which the Torah warns us in the text &#x201C;Ye shall not vex one another&#x201D; (Lev. 25:17).</p>
<h1>CHAPTER VIII.</h1>
<p>1. The good reserved for the righteous is life in the world to come,&#x2014;a life which is immortal, a good without evil. Thus is it written in the Torah &#x201C;that it may be well with thee and that thou mayest prolong thy days&#x201D; (Deut. 22:7); the traditional interpretation of which is as follows: &#x201C;that it may be well with thee&#x201D;, in a world altogether good; &#x201C;that thou mayest prolong thy days&#x201D;, in a world unending, that is, the world to come. II. The reward of the righteous is that they will attain this bliss and abide in this state of happiness; the punishment of the wicked is that they will not attain this life but will be cut off and die. He who does not attain this life will be dead, in the sense that he will never live again but will be cut off in his wickedness and perish like the brute beast. This is the penalty of <italic>excision,</italic> referred to in the Torah, as it is written, &#x201C;That soul shall utterly be cut off, his iniquity shall be upon him&#x201D; (Num. 15:31): which has been traditionally interpreted as follows: &#x201C;&#x2018;cut off&#x2019;, in this world; &#x201C;utterly cut off&#x2019;, in the world to come&#x201D;. This means that that soul, after its separation from the body (at the close of its existence) on earth, will not attain life in the world to come but will be cut off from that life also.</p>
<p>2. III. In the world to come, there is nothing corporeal, and no material substance; there are only souls of the righteous without bodies,&#x2014;like the ministering angels. And since in that world there are no bodies, there is neither eating there, nor drinking, nor aught that human beings need on earth. None of the conditions occur there which are incident to physical bodies in this world, such as sitting, standing, sleep, death, grief, merriment, etc. So the ancient sages said, &#x201C;In the life hereafter, there is no eating, no drinking, no connubial intercourse, but the righteous sit with their crowns on their heads and enjoy the radiance of the Shechinah&#x201D;<xref rid="fn157">&#x002A;</xref>. IV. This passage clearly indicates that as there is no eating or drinking there, there is no physical body hereafter. The phrase &#x201C;the righteous sit&#x201D;&#x2014;is allegorical and means that the souls of the righteous exist there without labour or fatigue. The phrase &#x201C;their crowns on their heads&#x201D; refers to the knowledge they have acquired, and for the sake of which they have attained life in the world to come. This is their crown, in the same sense as where Solomon says &#x201C;with the crown wherewith his mother hath crowned him&#x201D; (Song of Songs 3:11). And just as in the text &#x201C;Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads&#x201D; (Is. 35:10), joy is not to be understood as a material substance that actually rests on the head, so &#x2018;the Crown&#x2019;, of which the sages here speak, is not to be taken literally but refers to knowledge. V. And what is the meaning of the sages&#x2019; statement: &#x201C;they enjoy the radiance of the Shechinah&#x201D;<xref rid="fn158">&#x002A;</xref>? It means that the righteous attain to a knowledge and realisation of the truth concerning God to which they had not attained while they were in the murky and lowly body.</p>
<p>3. VI. The soul, whenever mentioned in this connection, is not the vital element requisite for bodily existence, but that form of soul which is identical with the intelligence which apprehends the Creator, as far as it is able, and apprehends other abstract concepts and other things. It is the psychic form, which we expounded in the Fourth Chapter of the Laws concerning the fundamental principles of the Torah. And it is this which, in this connection, is called Soul. VII. That life, as it is immortal,&#x2014;death being only incidental to the body, which does not exist in the hereafter&#x2014;is called &#x2018;the bond of life&#x2019;, as it is said, &#x201C;but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bond of life; and the souls of thine enemies, them he shall sling out&#x2026;..&#x201D; (I. Sam. 25:29). And this is a recompense than which there is none higher; a bliss beyond which there is nothing more blissful. And for this, all the prophets yearned.</p>
<p>4. How many names have been metaphorically applied to it: &#x2018;The mountain of the Lord&#x2019;, &#x2018;His holy place&#x2019;, &#x2018;the way of holiness&#x2019;, &#x2018;the holy way&#x2019;, &#x2018;the courtyards of the Lord&#x2019;, &#x2018;the tent of the Lord&#x2019;, &#x2018;the beauty of the Lord&#x2019;, the temple of the Lord&#x2019;, &#x2018;the house of the Lord&#x2019;, &#x2018;the gate of the Lord&#x2019;&#x0021; The sages metaphorically call this bliss, destined for the righteous, &#x2018;the Banquet&#x2019;. Its general name is &#x2018;the World to Come&#x2019;.</p>
<p>5. VIII. The severest retribution beyond which punishment can no further go, is that the soul shall be cut off and not attain the life hereafter, as it is said, &#x201C;That soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him&#x201D;<xref rid="fn159">&#x002A;&#x002A;</xref> (Num. 15:31). This destruction it is to which the prophets metaphorically apply the terms &#x2018;the Pit of destruction&#x2019;, &#x2018;Abaddon&#x2019;, &#x2018;Tophet&#x2019;, &#x2018;Leech&#x2019;; and all other expressions which connote cessation and destruction are applied to it, because it is a ruin that is irreparable and a loss which is irrecoverable.</p>
<p>6. IX. Possibly you may esteem this boon (of life hereafter) lightly, and imagine that the only reward for fulfilling religious precepts and walking consistently in the ways of truth is to enjoy good food and drink; to have intercourse with &#x2018;beautiful forms&#x2019;; to wear fine linen and brocade; to dwell in palaces of ivory; to be served on gold and silver plate and enjoy similar things, as indeed those foolish and silly Arabs, who lead dissolute lives, imagine. X. The wise and intelligent know, however, that all these pleasures are exaggerated and inane, and there is no profit in them. They are regarded by us as a great boon because we are beings with physical bodies and material frames which have need of all these things. The soul only desires and longs for them because they are necessary to the body, and enable it to attain its needs and maintain its health; and when the body ceases to exist, all these things become null and void. XI. As to the blissful state of the soul in the world to come, there is no way on earth in which we can comprehend or know it. For in this earthly existence we only have knowledge of physical pleasure; and it is for this that we long. But the bliss of the life hereafter is exceedingly great, and can only metaphorically be compared with earthly enjoyments. In reality, however, there is no comparison between the bliss of the soul in the life hereafter and the gratification afforded to the body on earth by food and drink. That spiritual bliss is unsearchable and beyond compare. So David said, &#x201C;How great is Thy goodness which Thou hast laid up for them that fear Thee&#x201D; (Ps. 31:19).</p>
<p>7. How David yearned and longed for the life in the world to come, as it is said, &#x201C;Had I not believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living&#x2019;&#x2026;. (Ps. 27:13). XII. The ancient sages taught us that a clear comprehension of the bliss in the life hereafter is unattainable to any man. None but God knows its grandeur, beauty and power. All the boons which the prophets prophesied to Israel only refer to material things that Israel will enjoy in the days of King Messiah, when sovereignty will be restored to Israel. XIII. But as for the bliss in the world to come, nought can be compared with, or likened to it. And the prophets did not depict it, so as not to depreciate it by their imaginary picture. Thus Isaiah said, &#x201C;Eye hath not seen beside Thee, O God, what He prepareth for him that waiteth for Him&#x201D; (Is. 64:3); that is, the bliss which neither the eye of the prophet nor any one else but God, hath seen, He hath prepared for the man who waits for Him. The sages say, &#x201C;All the prophets only prophesied concerning the days of the Messiah. But the world to come, &#x201C;no eye hath seen but Thine, O God&#x201D;.</p>
<p>8. XIV. The reason why the sages styled it &#x2018;The World to Come&#x2019; is not because it is not now in existence and will only come into being when this world shall have passed away. That is not so. The world to come now exists, as it is said, &#x201C;which Thou hast treasured up (for them that fear Thee), which Thou hast wrought (for them that trust in Thee before the children of men&#x201D;) (Ps. 31:19-20). It is called the World to Come, only because human beings will enter into it at a time subsequent to the life of the present world in which we now exist with body and soul,&#x2014;and this existence comes first.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER IX.</h1>
<p>1. It is known that the reward for the fulfilment of the commandments and the good to which we will attain if we have kept the way of the Lord, as prescribed in the Law, is life in the World to Come, as it is said, &#x201C;That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days&#x201D; (Deut. 22:7), while the retribution exacted from the wicked who have abandoned the ways of righteousness prescribed in the Torah is excision, as it is said, &#x201C;that soul shall be utterly cut off; his iniquity shall be upon him&#x201D; (Num. 15:31). What then is the meaning of the statement found everywhere in the Torah that &#x2018;if ye obey, it will happen to you thus; if ye do not obey, it will be otherwise&#x2019;; and all these happenings will take place in this world, such as war and peace; sovereignty and subjection; residence in the Promised Land, and exile; prosperity in one&#x2019;s activities and failure, and all the other things predicted in the words of the Covenant (Lev. ch. 26. Deut. ch. 28)? II. All those promises were (once) truly (fulfilled) and will again be so. When we fulfil all the commandments of the Torah, all the good things of this world will come to us. When however we transgress the precepts, the evils that are written in the Torah will befall us. But nevertheless, those good things are not the final reward for the fulfilment of the commandments, nor are those evils the last penalty exacted from one who transgresses all the commandments. These matters are to be understood as follows: III. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave us this Law&#x2014;a tree of lfie. Whoever fulfills what is written therein and knows it with a complete and correct knowledge will attain thereby life in the World to Come. According to the greatness of his deeds and abundance of his knowledge will be the measure in which he will attain that life. He has further promised us in the Torah, that, if we observe its behests joyously and cheerfully, and continually meditate on its wisdom, He will remove from us the obstacles that hinder us in its observance, such as sickness, war, famine, and other calamities; and will bestow upon us all the material benefits which will strengthen our ability to fulfil the Law, such as plenty, peace, abundance of silver and gold. IV. Thus we will not be engaged, all our days, in providing for our bodily needs, but will have leisure to study wisdom and fulfil the commandment, and thus attain life in the World to Come. Hence, after the assurance of material benefits, it is said in the Torah, &#x201C;And it shall be righteousness unto us, if we observe to do all this commandment before the Lord, our God, as He hath commanded us&#x201D; (Deut. 6:25). V. So too, He taught us in the Torah that if we deliberately forsake it and occupy ourselves with temporal follies, as the text says, &#x201C;But Jeshurun waxed fat and kicked&#x201D; (Deut. 32:15),&#x2014;the true Judge will deprive the forsakers of all those material benefits which only served to encourage them to be recalcitrant, and will send upon them all the calamities that will prevent their attaining the life hereafter, so that they will perish in their wickedness. This is expressed by the Torah in the text: &#x201C;Because thou didst not serve the Lord, thy God, with joyfulness and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance of all things, therefore shalt thou serve thine enemy whom the Lord shall send against thee&#x201D;<xref rid="fn160">&#x002A;</xref> (Deut. 28:47-48). VI. Hence, all those benedictions and maledictions are to be explained as follows: If you have served God with joy and observed His way, He will bestow upon you those blessings and avert from you those curses, so that you will have leisure to become wise in the Torah and occupy yourselves therewith, and thus attain life hereafter, and then it will be well with you in the world which is entirely blissful and you will enjoy length of days in an existence which is everlasting. So you will enjoy both worlds,&#x2014;a happy life on earth leading to the life in the World to Come. For if wisdom is not acquired and good deeds are not performed here, there will be nought meriting a recompense hereafter, as it is said, &#x201C;for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave&#x201D; (Eccles. 9:10). VII. But if you have forsaken the Lord and have erred in eating, drinking, fornication, and similar things, He will bring upon you all those curses and withhold from you all those blessings till your days will end in confusion and terror, and you will have neither the free mind nor the healthy body requisite for the fulfilment of the commandments so that you will suffer perdition in the life hereafter and will thus have lost both worlds,&#x2014;for when one is troubled here on earth with diseases, war or famine, he does not occupy himself with the acquisition of wisdom or the performance of religious precepts by which life hereafter is gained.</p>
<p>2. VIII. Hence, all Israelites, their prophets and sages, longed for the advent of Messianic times, that they might have relief from the wicked tyranny that does not permit them properly to occupy themselves with the study of the Torah and the observance of the commandments; that they might have ease, devote themselves to getting wisdom, and thus attain to life in the World to Come. IX. For in those days, knowledge, wisdom and truth will increase, as it is said &#x201C;For the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord&#x201D; (Is. 11:9), and it is said, &#x201C;They will no more teach everyone his brother and everyone his neighbour&#x201D; (Jer. 31:34), and further, &#x201C;I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh&#x201D; (Ezek 36:26). X. Because the King who will arise from the seed of David will possess more wisdom than Solomon and will be a great prophet, approaching Moses, our teacher<xref rid="fn161">&#x002A;</xref>, he will teach the whole of the Jewish people and instruct them in the way of God; and all nations will come to hear him, as it is said, &#x201C;And at the end of days it shall come to pass that the Mount of the Lord&#x2019;s house shall be established as the top of the mountains&#x201D; (Micah 4:1, Is. 2:2). XI. The ultimate and perfect reward, the final bliss which will suffer neither interruption nor diminution is the life in the world to come. The Messianic era, on the other hand, will be realized in this world; which will continue in its normal course except that independent sovereignty will be restored to Israel. The ancient sages already said, &#x201C;The only difference between the present and the Messianic era is that political oppression will then cease.</p>
<h1>CHAPTER X.</h1>
<p>1. Let not a man say, &#x2018;I will observe the precepts of the Torah and occupy myself with its wisdom, in order that I may obtain all the blessings written in the Torah, or to attain life in the world to come; I will abstain from transgressions against which the Torah warns, so that I may be saved from the curses written in the Torah, or that I may not be cut off from life in the world to come.&#x2019; II. It is not right to serve God after this fashion for whoever does so, serves Him out of fear. This is not the standard set by the prophets and sages. Only those serve God in this way, who are illiterate, women or children whom one trains to serve out of fear, till their knowledge shall have increased when they will serve out of love.</p>
<p>2. III. Whoever serves God out of love, occupies himself with the study of the Law and the fulfilment of commandments and walks in the paths of wisdom, impelled by no external motive whatsoever, moved neither by fear of calamity nor by the desire to obtain material benefits; such a man does what is truly right because it is truly right, and ultimately, happiness comes to him as a result of his conduct. IV. This standard is indeed a very high one; not every sage attained to it. It was the standard of the patriarch Abraham whom God called His lover, because he served only out of love. It is the standard which God, through Moses, bids us achieve, as it is said, &#x201C;And thou shalt love the Lord, thy God&#x201D; (Deut. 6:5). When one loves God with the right love, he will straightway observe all the commandments out of love.</p>
<p>3. V. What is the love of God that is befitting ? It is to love the Eternal with a great and exceeding love, so strong that one&#x2019;s soul shall be knit up with the love of God, and one should be continually enraptured by it, like a love-sick individual, whose mind is at no time free from his passion for a particular woman, the thought of her filling his heart at all times, when sitting down or rising up, when he is eating or drinking. Even intenser should be the love of God in the hearts of those who love Him. And this love should continually possess them, even as He commanded us in the phrase, &#x201C;with all thy heart and with all thy soul&#x201D; (Deut. 6:5). This, Solomon expressed allegorically in the sentence, &#x201C;for I am sick with love&#x201D; (Song of Songs 2:5). The entire Song of Songs is indeed an allegory descriptive of this love.</p>
<p>4. VI. The ancient sages said; Peradventure, you will say, &#x2018;I will study Torah, in order that I may become rich, that I may be called Rabbi, that I may receive a reward in the world to come&#x2019;. It is therefore said, &#x201C;To love the Lord&#x201D;. Whatever you do, do is out of love only. VII. The text: &#x201C;(Happy is the man that feareth the Lord), that delighteth greatly in His commandments&#x201D; (Ps. 112:1) has been thus explained by the sages&#x2014;&#x201C;<italic>In His commandments</italic>&#x2014;not in the reward for His commandments&#x201D;. So too, the greatest sages were wont specifically to exhort those among their disciples who were understanding and intelligent &#x201C;Be not like servants who minister to their master, upon the condition of receiving a reward&#x201D; (Ethics of the Fathers 1:3). But it is proper to be like servants who serve their master not for the sake of receiving aught; but only because he is the master, it is right to serve him; that is, serve him out of love.</p>
<p>5. VIII. Whoever engages in the study of the Torah, in order that he may receive a reward or avoid calamities is not studying the Torah for its own sake. Whoever occupies himself with the Torah, neither out of fear nor for the sake of recompense, but solely out of love for the Lord of the whole Earth who enjoined us to do so, is occupied with the Torah for its own sake. The sages however said, &#x201C;One should always engage in the study of the Torah, even if not for its own sake; for he who begins thus will end by studying it for its own sake&#x201D;. IX. Hence, when instructing the young, women or the illiterate generally, we teach them to serve God out of fear or for the sake of reward, till their knowledge increases and they have attained a large measure of wisdom. Then we reveal to them this mystic truth, little by little, and train them by easy stages till they have grasped and comprehended it, and serve God out of love.</p>
<p>6. X. It is known and certain that the love of God does not become closely knit in a man&#x2019;s heart till he is continuously and thoroughly possessed by it and gives up everything else in the world for it; as God commanded us, &#x201C;with all thy heart and with all thy soul&#x201D; (Deut. 6:5). One only loves God with the knowledge with which one knows Him. According to the knowledge, will be the love. If the former be little or much, so will the latter be little or much. XI. A person ought therefore to devote himself to the understanding and comprehension of those sciences and studies which will inform him concerning his Master, as far as it lies in human faculties to understand and comprehend&#x2014;as indeed we have explained in the Laws of the Foundations of the Torah.</p>
