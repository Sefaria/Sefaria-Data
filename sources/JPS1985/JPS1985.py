Stripped out all footnotes. Footnote markers are in rectangular brackets.

Parsha names are all in caps - use str.upper to find them.

Book names are not clearly marked. A previous line can be indicated as a book name by the chapter number
resetting to 1.

Chapter numbers are listed as <digit><space>. Verse numbers are connected to words.

On every line called, call str.replace as follows:
% --when it follows a letter means that there should be a dot under that letter
@ --stands for "s" with a dot underneath. - only appears in footnotes

A first run should strip out all footnote markers. Later on, a script should be run to map footnotes to
Book, chapter, verse.

The information declaring the beginning of a new chapter always appears in the next line. Because of this, each
line is processed, then saved as previous_line. Decisions about what to do with this line can then be made based
on the next line in the text.
