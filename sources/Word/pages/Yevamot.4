Aleph: One who does chalitza to his sister-in-law and she was found pregnant (by her dead husband) and gives birth, when the child is viable (will probably be born and not miscarried) he is mutar to her relatives (for it is as if chalitza never happened), she is mutar to his relatives, and she is not pasul for kehuna (for kohanim cannot marry a chalutza).  If the child is not viable, he is assur to her relatives (for the chalitza is still valid), she is assur to his relatives, and she is pasul for the kehuna.
Bet: One who marries his sister-in-law and she was found pregnant and gives birth, when the child is viable he will exit (the marriage), and they are chayav a korban (chatat for unintentionally transgressing a lo ta’ase).  And if the child is not viable, it (the marriage) will stand.  It is a doubt whether it (the baby born) is nine (months) old by the first (husband) or seven by the last, he exits, and the child is valid, and they are chayav a dependant asham (which is brought on a doubt of transgression).
Gimmel: One who is waiting for her brother in law to whom property fell (she inherited property), Beit Hillel and Beit Shamay agree that she sells it or gives it away and it stands.  If shed died, what should they do with her ktuba (the value promised to her if her husband dies) and the property which comes in and goes out with her (her nichsei melog, things which were hers throughout marriage, but the husband receives the benefit from)?  Beit Shamay says, the heirs of the husband (who died) split with the heirs of the father (her father).  Beit Hillel says, the property (nichsei tzon barzel, which the wife brings into the marriage, but the husband owns and is responsible for) is for them (both parties), the ktuba belongs to the heirs of the husband, and the property which comes in and out with her belongs to the heirs of the father.
Daled: If he married her, behold she is like his wife in all things, except that her ktuba is (taken from) the property of the first husband (who died).
Hay: It is a great mitzva to do yibum.  If he doesn’t want to, they go to all the brothers (to find one).  If they didn’t want to, they return to the oldest and say, the mitzva is on you, either do chalitza or do yibum!
Vav: If he made it (his decision) dependant on a minor (brother) until he grows up, on an adult until he comes from overseas, on a deaf-dumb, or on a mentally infirm person, they do not listen to him, rather they say to him, the mitzva is on you, either do chalitza or do yibum!
Zayin: One who does chalitza for his sister-in-law, behold he is like one of the brothers for the portion (of the dead brother, meaning that we do not punish him for doing chalitza).  And if there is a father, the property (of the dead brother) is of the father.  One who married his sister-in-law earned the property of his brother.  Rabi Yehuda says, either way, if there is a father, the property is of the father.  One who does chalitza for his sister-in-law, he is assur to her relatives, and she is assur to his relatives.  He is assur to her mother, her mother’s mother, her father’s mother, her daughter, the daughter of her daughter, the daughter of her son, and her sister as long as she is extant, but his (the one who did chalitza) brothers are mutar (to these women).  And she is assur to his father, his father’s father, his son, his son’s son, his brother, and the son of his brother.  One is mutar to the relative of a rival to one who he did chalitza with, but he is assur in the rival of the relative of the one who he did chalitza with.
Chet: One who did chalitza for his sister-in-law, his brother married her sister, and he died, she gets chalitza but not yibum.  And so too one who divorces his wife, and his brother married her sister, and he died, behold this one is patur from chalitza and yibum.
Tet: A woman waiting for yibum, and his brother (of the man she is waiting for) married her sister, in the name of Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira they said, they say to him, wait until your older brother does the deed.  If his brother did chalitza for her or married her, he (the younger brother) may marry his wife.  If the sister-in-law (waiting for yibum) dies, he may marry his wife.  If the one to do yibum died, he (the younger brother) should exit fro his wife with a get.  And the wife of his brother with chalitza.
Yud: The yevama (sister-in-law awaiting yibum) does not do chalitza or yibum until she has three months (after the loss of her husband).  And so too all other women may not be engaged or marry until they have three months (after their marriage ended), whether virgins or married (with consecration), whether divorcee or widow, whether married or engaged.  Rabi Yehuda says, the married may become engaged and the engaged may marry, except for the engaged or married in Yehuda, for he is haughty with her (and if we don’t allow them to marry, he might come to sleep with her before they marry).  Rabi Yossi says, all women may get married except for the widow because of the mourning.
Yud Aleph: Four brothers married four women and they (the four brothers) died, if the eldest (of the still living brothers) wanted to do yibum for all of them, he has the right.  One who was married to two woman and died, the sleeping with or chalitza for one of them exempts her rival.  If one was valid and one was invalid, if he does chalitza, he does chalitza to the invalid, and if he wanted to do yibum, he does yibum for the valid.
Yud Bet: One who re-marries his divorced wife, marries the woman he did chalitza for, and marries a relative of the women he did chalitza for, he must exit and the child is a mamzer according to Rabi Akiva.  Chachamim say, the child is not a mamzer.  And they admit in the case of the relative of his ex-wife the child is a mamzer.
Yud Gimmel: What is a mamzer?  All close relatives which fall under, “he may not come (sleep with)” according to Rabi Akiva.  Shimon the Timni says, all who he is chayav karet in the hands of Heaven, and the halacha is like him.  Rabi Yehoshua says, all who one is chayav death from the court.  Rabi Shimon ben Azay said, I found a scroll of relationships in Yerushalayim and it was written in it, so-and-so is a mamzer from the wife of a man (a child of adultery), upholding the opinion of Rabi Yehoshua.  If his wife died, he is mutar in her sister, if he divorced her and she died, he is mutar in her sister, if he married another (unrelated woman) and she died, he is mutar in her sister, he did yibum and she died, he is mutar in her sister, or if he did chalitza and she died, he is mutar in her sister.
