Aleph: One who throws from the private domain to the public domain or vice versa is chayav.  From a private domain to a private domain or from a public domain to itself, Rabi Akiva makes him chayav and Chachamim exempt.
Bet: How?  There are two balconies (private domains) opposite each other in the public domain one, who passes or throws from one to the other is patur.  If they are both in one row (next to each other) one who passes is chayav and one who throws is patur, for this was the work of the levi’im (in the Mishkan, which is where we learn the melachot from), there were two wagons one behind the other in the public domain, they would pass the beams from one to the other, but not throw.  The rim of a pit and a rock which are taller than ten (tfachim) and their width is four (tfachim), one who takes from (on top of) them or puts on top of them is chayav.  If it’s less than this, he’s patur.
Gimmel: One who throws (a fig cake) four amot and it sticks to a wall taller than ten tfachim, it is as one who throws in the air (which is patur).  Under ten tfachim, it is like one who throws on he ground (chayav).  One who throws four amot while on the ground is chayav.  If one threw less than four amot and it rolled outside of four amot, he’s patur.  (If he threw) outside of four amot and it rolled inside of four amot, he’s chayav.
Daled: One who throws four amot into the sea is patur.  If there was a shallow pool of water and the public domain goes into it, one who throws four amot into it is chayav.  And how much is a shallow pool of water?  Less than ten tfachim.  If there was a shallow pool of water and the public domain went into it, one who throws four amot in it is chayav.
Hay: One who throws from the sea to land or from land to the sea; from the sea to a boat or a boat to the sea; or from a boat to another boat is patur.  If the boats are tied to each other, one may pass from one to the other.  If they aren’t tied, even though they are close, one may not pass from one to the other.
Vav: One who throws and remembers after it has left his hand, and another intercepted it, a dog intercepted it, or it burnt, he’s patur.  If he threw it in order to in order to make a wound, whether in a person or an animal, and he remembered before it made a wound, he’s patur.  This is the general rule, all who are chayav a chatat aren’t chayav until their beginning and end are (with an intention which is) by accident.  If the beginning is by accident and the end is on purpose or vice versa, they’re patur, until they’re both by accident.
