Aleph: Five people don’t take truma, and if they did, their truma isn’t truma, the deaf-mute, mentally infirm, minor, one who takes truma from what isn’t his, and a non-Jew who took from that of a Jew, even with permission, is not truma.
Bet: A deaf person who can speak, but not hear will not give, but if he gave, it is truma.  When Chachamim normally talk about a cheresh it is one who can’t hear or speak.
Gimmel: A minor who doesn’t yet have two hairs, Rabi Yehuda says, his truma is truma.  Rabi Yossi says, if he hasn’t reached the age of vows (twelve) his truma isn’t truma.  Once he has reached the age of vows, his truma is truma.
Daled: One may not take truma from olives for oil, and not from grapes for wine.  If they did separate, Beit Shamay says, only that which was taken for the fruit is truma, and Beit Hillel says, the truma isn’t truma.
Hay: One may not take truma from leket, shichicha, pe’ah, hefker, ma’aser rishon that has had truma taken, ma’aser sheni or hekdesh that has been redeemed, the chayav on the patur, the patur on the chayav, the harvested for the unharvested, the unharvested on the harvested, the new (from this year) on the old (from last year), the old on the new, from Israeli produce for non-Israeli produce, and not from non-Israeli produce on Israeli produce.  If one took these trumot, his truma isn’t truma.
Vav: Five types of people should not take truma, but if they did, their truma is truma.  The mute, drunk, (currently) naked, blind, and bal keri shouldn’t take truma, but if they did, their truma is truma.
Zayin: One doesn’t take truma by measure, weight, or number, but one takes truma from what has been measured, weighed, or counted.  One does not take truma by a basket or hamper of a set size, but he may fill them half or a third of their size (to show he is only holding the truma, not measuring).  One may not take truma as half of a se’ah measure, for that is a measure itself.
Chet: One doesn’t fake truma from olives which are going to be crushed or from grapes which are going to be stomped.  If he did, his truma is truma, but he must go back and take again.  If the first becomes mixed with chulin (and makes it like truma) by itself, so one who eats from it owes chomesh (a fifth extra), but not the second.
Tet: One may take truma from oil for olives to be crushed and from wine for grapes to be stomped.  If one took from oil for olives to be eaten, olives from olives to be eaten, wine on grapes for eating, or grapes on grapes for eating, and then he decided to process and not eat, he need not take more truma.
Yud: One may not take truma from a finished product for an unfinished product, not from an unfinished product for a finished product, and not from an unfinished product on an unfinished product.  But if he took, his truma is truma.
