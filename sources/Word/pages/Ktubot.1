Bet: A virgin, her ktuba is two hundred (zuz, owed to her if the husband dies or they get divorced) and a widow is a maneh (one hundred).  A virgin widow and one divorced or chalutza from engagement, their ktuba is two hundred, and they may have a claim about virginity.  A convert, captive, or maidservant who was redeemed, converted, or freed, less than three years and one day old, their ktuba is two hundred and they have a claim about virginity.
Gimmel: An adult (man) who has sex with a minor, a minor (boy) who has sex with an adult, and one who was hit (penetrated) with wood, their ktuba is two hundred according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, one who was hit with wood her ktuba is a maneh.

Whether the widow is a (bat) yisra’el or a widow is a (bat) kohen, her ktuba is a maneh.  The court for (issues pertaining specifically to) the kohanim would collect for a virgin four hundred zuz and the Chachamim did not prevent them.
Vav: One who married a woman and did not find her to be a virgin, after I was betrothed I was raped (so I deserve my ktuba), and your field was flooded (she gives a parable meaning it happens that you were unlucky).  And that one (the husband) says, not so, it was before I betrothed you, and my taking was taking in error.  Raban Gamliel and Rabi Eliezer say, she is believed.

Zayin: She says, I was struck with wood, and he said, not so, rather you were trodden (slept with) by a man.  Raban Gamliel and Rabi Eliezer say, she is believed.
