Aleph: These things cause a break, making a need for a new pe’ah: a river, a large puddle, a private road, a public road, a private path, and a public path, only if they are in both seasons, a pit, a fallow area, and a change in seed.  Harvesting for fodder breaks it according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say this is only good if he plowed that area.
Bet: A water system which makes it unable to be plowed as one, Rabi Yehuda says it stops it.  And hills in the field that have to be plowed by tool, even though cattle can’t pass over it, it doesn’t break it.
Gimmel: Those are for seeded plants, but only a fence works for trees.  And if the branches are linked, like a wall, it doesn’t stop the pe’ah.
Daled: For carob trees, if you can see from one to the next.  Raban Gamliel says, my father used to give one pe’ah on the olive trees which were all over, and one for the carobs which were in sight of each other.  Rabi Eliezer B’Rabi Tzadok said in the name of Raban Gamliel that they even gave for the carobs they had in the whole town.
Hay: If your entire field is one crop, even if you harvest at separate times, you give one pe’ah.  If it’s two crops, even if you harvest them at the same time you give two pe’ot.  If you use two types of the same crop, you leave one pe’ah for each harvest.
Vav: Once Rabi Shimon of Mitzpeh asked Raban Gamliel (about planting two types of wheat) and they went to the Sanhedrin. Nachum the scribe said, I learned from Rabi Myasha who learned through various sources who learned a halacha leMoshe miSinai like the previous mishna.
Zayin: A field that non-Jews cut, bandits cut, ants ate it, or the wind or an animal destroyed it is patur.  If it’s half and half, it’s patur, because pe’ah is on a whole field.
Chet: If it’s half and half, but the bandits were first, you give pe’ah on what you cut.  If you sell the second half, the buyer gives pe’ah. If you make the second half hefker, if you redeem it, you give pe’ah on everything.
