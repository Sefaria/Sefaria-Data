Aleph: An engaged woman, her father and her husband may annul her vows.  If the father annulled and the husband didn’t or the husband annulled and the father didn’t, it isn’t annulled, and there is no need to say (that is stands) if one of them upholds it.
Bet: If the father died, the right does not fall to the husband.  If the husband died, the right falls to the father.  In this the power of the father is greater than the power of the husband.  In another thing the power of the husband is greater than the power of the father, for the husband may annul from a bogeret (adult) and the father cannot annul from a bogeret.
Gimmel: If she vowed and she is engaged, she got divorced that day, engaged (again) that day, even a hundred times, her father and her last husband annul her vows.  This is the general rule, whoever has not gone out into her own authority (by becoming a bogeret or married) for even one hour, her husband and her last husband annul her vows.
Daled: The way of scholars, before his daughter leaves from him (his house) he tells her, all the vows you vowed in my house behold they are annulled.  And so too a husband until she enters his domain her, he says to her, all vows which you vowed before you enter my authority behold they are annulled, for when she enters into his authority, he cannot annul (her vows made prior to marriage).
Hay: A bogeret who waited twelve months and a widow thirty days (their respective periods of engagement), Rabi Eliezer says, since her husband is chayav in he maintenance, he may annul.  Chachamim say, the husband cannot annul until she enters into his domain.
Vav: One waiting for yibum whether for one yavam or two yevamim, Rabi Eliezer says, he (either yavam) may annul.  Rabi Yehoshua says, (if she is waiting) for one, but not for two.  Rabi Eliezer said, just as a woman who he acquired for himself he annuls her vows, a woman who heaven acquired for him he should not annul her vows?  Rabi Akiva said to him, no, if you say it by a woman who he acquired for himself, that no others have rights to her, would you say it by a woman who heaven acquired for him, and that there are others who have rights to her.  Rabi Yehoshua said to him, Akiva, your words are by two yevamim, what do you respond on one yavam?  He said to him, the yevama is not completely of the yavam’s the way an engaged (woman) is completely for her husband.
Zayin: One who says to his wife, all vows which you vow from now until I come from such-and-such a place are upstanding, he didn’t say anything.  Behold they are annulled, Rabi Eliezer says, they are annulled, and Chachamim say they are not annulled.  Rabi Eliezer said, if he annulled vows which come to be binding, can he not annul vows which have not come to be binding?  They said to him, behold he says, “he husband may uphold it or her husband may annul it,” that which can be confirmed, can be annulled, if it cannot become confirmed, it cannot be annulled.
Chet: Annulling of vows (can happen) the whole day.  There is in this (instruction) to be lenient and to be stringent.  How?  If she vowed on Shabbat night, he may annul Shabbat night and on Shabbat day until it darkens.  If she vowed while it was darkening, he may annul until it gets dark, for if it got dark and he didn’t annul, he cannot annul.
