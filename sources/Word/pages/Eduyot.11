Aleph: All images (of avoda zara) are assur, because they are (all) worshipped (at least) once a year, according to Rabi Meir.  The Chachamim say, they are not assur, except one which has a staff, a bird, or a ball in its hand.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, any which has anything in its hand.
Bet: One who finds shards of images, behold these are mutar.  If he found the form of a hand or the form of a foot, behold these are assur, because things like them are worshipped.
Gimmel: One who finds vessels and on them is the figure of the son, the figure of the moon, or the figure of a dragon, he shall bring it to the Dead Sea (for there it will be destroyed there).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, those (figures) on honored (expensive) ones (vessels) are assur, those on detested (cheap) ones are mutar.  Rabbi Yossi says, he grinds (the vessels) and throws them to the wind or brings it to the sea.  They said to him, even that will become fertilizer (which is assur), as it says, “and not a thing will stick in your hand from the exiled (forbidden objects).”
Daled: Proklos ben Philosophis asked Raban Gamliel (when he was) in Akko washing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite, he said to him, it is written in your torah, “and not a thing will stick in your hand from the exiled property (forbidden objects),” so why are you bathing in the bathhouse of Aphrodite?  He said to him, one does not answer In a bathhouse.  And when he (Raban Gamliel) exited, he (Raban Gamliel) said to him, I did not to her place, she came to my place (it was a preexisting bathhouse which was then dedicated to Aphrodite), one may not say let us make this bathhouse a beauty for Aphrodite, rather one says, let us make Aphrodite a beauty for this bathhouse.  Another thing (a different explanation), (even) if they gave you a lot of money, you would not enter before your avoda zara naked, after a (seminal) emission), or urinating before it, but this stands before the sewer and everyone urinates before it.  The pasuk does not say other than, “their gods,” that which one acts before it like a god (if it is avoda zara which people treat as such it) is assur, but that which one does not act before it like a god is mutar.
Hay: If bon-Jews worship the mountains and the hills they are mutar, but what is upon them is assur, as it says, “and you shall not be jealous of silver and gold which is on them and take it.”  Rabi Yossi Hagelili says (the pasuk says), “their gods on mountains,” and not, (if) the mountains are their gods, and, “their gods on hills,” and not, the hills are their gods.  And because of what is ashera (a tree idol) assur?  Because it has the grasp of the hand of people (people contributed to making it by planting it), and anything which has the grasp of the hand of people in it is assur.  Rabi Akiva said, I will clarify and judge before you, any place that you find a tall mountain, a high hill, or a pleasant tree, know that there is avoda zara there.
Vav: One whose house was next to avoda zara and it fell, it is assur to build it (for it seems his building is benefiting the avoda zara).  What should he do?  He withdraws within his (property) four amot and build (so it is clearly separate).  If (the property) was his and of avoda zara (split) it is judges half by half (he must assume that half of any structure, such as a wall, he makes, is counted towards his four amot).  His stones, wood, and earth (which is joint property) become tame like a sheretz (slithering animal), as it says, “detest shall you detest it (and there is a play on words with sheretz).”  Rabi Akiva says, (it becomes tame) like a nidda (menstruating woman), as it says, “you shal distance (idolatry) like a menstruant go out and tell him.”  Just as a nidda makes tame by carrying (an object), so too avoda zara makes tame by carrying.
Zayin: There are three (types) of houses, a house which is built from the beginning for avoda zara, behold this is assur (to be benefited from), if he limed it or cemented it for avoda zara and renewed it, he may remove what was renewed (and use it), or if one brought avoda zara into it and then removed it, it is mutar.  There are three stones, a stone which was carved from the beginning for a pedestal (for an idol), behold this is assur, if he limed it or cemented it for the sake of avoda zara or renewed it, one removes what he renewed (and uses the stone), and if he stood avoda zara on it and then removed it, behold this is mutar.  There are three asherot (levels of use of a tree as avoda zara), a tree which he planted from the beginning for avoda zara, behold this is assur, if cut it back or he trimmed it for avoda zara and it had new growth, he removes the new growth, and if he stood avoda zara under it and nullified (removed) it, behold it is mutar.  Which is an ashera?  Any (tree) which has avoda zara under it.  Rabi Shimon says, any which one worships.  And there was a case in Tzidan with a tree which they would worship and they found a mound under it.  Rabi Shimon said to them, check this mound and they checked it, and they found an image in it.  He said to them, since they were worshiping the image, we will allow them the tree.
Chet: He may not sit in its shade (that of an ashera), but if he sat in it, he is tahor (for avoda zara makes people tame).  And he may not pass under it, and if he passed, he is tame.  If it steals (space) from the public (domain) and he passed under it, he is tahor.  And one may sow vegetables under it in the rainy season, but not in the dry season (for he is benefiting from its shade then), but lettuces, (one may) not (sow under an ashera) in the dry season or in the rainy season.  Rabi Yossi says, also not vegetables in the rainy season, because the dead leaves fall on them and are manure (fertilizer) for them.
Tet: If he took wood from them (asherot), they are assur from benefit (he may not gain any benefit from them).  If he fueled an oven with them if it a new oven (so they hardened it) he must shatter it, but if it is old, he must cool it.  If he baked bread in it, it is assur from benefit.  If it (the wood) got mixed with others, they are all assur from benefit.  Rabi Eliezer says, he must take the (value of what he is going to) benefit to the Dead Sea (where coins will be destroyed, and then he can use the forbidden objects).  They said to him, there is no redemption (of things which are) avoda zara.  If he took a shuttle (for a loom) from it, is it assur from benefit.  If he wove a garment with it, the garment is assur from benefit.  If it got mixed with others, and (even) if the other (got mixed with) others, they are all assur from benefit.  Rabi Eliezer says, he must take the benefit to the Dead Sea.  They said to him, there is no redemption for avoda zara.
Yud: How does he nullify it (a tree from being an ashera)?  If he trims it, prunes it, or took from it a staff or scepter, even a leaf, behold this is annulled.  If he smoothed it (the bark of the tree) for its sake (to make the ashera beautiful) it is assur, not for its sake, it is mutar.
