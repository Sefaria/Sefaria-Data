Aleph: A se’ah or tame truma that fell into less than one hundred (se’ah) of chulin, into ma’aser rishon, into ma’aser sheni, or into hekdesh, whether tame or tahor, they are left to rot.  If the one se’ah was tahor, they sell it to the kohanim at the price of truma, minus the price of the one se’ah.  If it fell into ma’aser rishon, he designates trumat ma’aser (and distributes accordingly).  If it fell into ma’aser sheni or hekdesh, these must simply be redeemed.  If the chulin were tame, it may be eaten in small cakes, roasted, kneaded with fruit juice, or split between doughs such that no dough contains more than a kbeitza.
Bet: A se’ah of tame truma that fell into one hundred (se’ah) of tahor chulin, Rabi Eliezer says, he takes truma and (the kohen must burn it, for I say, a se’ah that fell is a se’ah which was taken up (removed for truma).  Chachamim say, it is nullified, and it can be eaten in small cakes, roasted, kneaded with fruit juice, or divided between doughs, such that no dough contains more than a kbeitza.
Gimmel: A se’ah of tahor truma that fell into one hundred (se’ah) of tame chulin, it is nullified, and can be eaten as small cakes, roasted, kneaded with fruit juice, or divided between doughs, such that no dough has more than a kbeitza.
Daled: A se’ah of tame truma that fell into one hundred se’ah of tahor truma, Beit Shamay prohibits it, and bet Hillel allow it.  Beit Hillel said to Beit Shamay, since the tahor is assur to zarim and the tame is assur to kohanim, just as the tahor is nullified (when in chulin), so too the tame should be nullified.  Beit Shamay said, no, if chulin, which is treated leniently and is allowed to zarim nullifies the tahor, should the truma, which is treated strictly and is not allowed to zarim nullify the tame?  After they (Beit Shamay) admitted (that Beit Hillel was right), Rabi Eliezer says, he must take truma and (have the kohen) burn it.  And the Chachamim say, it is lost because it is so small.
Hay: A se’ah of truma that fell into one hundred (se’ah of chulin) which he lifted out but it fell into another place, Rabi Eliezer says, it makes meduma just as definite truma.  Chachamim say, it doesn’t make meduma, only as much as proportional in the removed se’ah (the part of the whole which was truma).
Vav: A se’ah of truma which fell into less than a hundred (se’ah of chulin), and part of the mixture fell into another place, Rabi Meir says, it makes meduma as if it were certainly truma, and Chachamim say it only makes meduma proportional to what made up the original meduma, leavened (dough, which was meduma) only makes meduma on leavened proportionally, and drawn water is pasul a mikva only proportionally (only if the drawn water was added in large enough portions, if not, it  does not combine with drawn water already in the mikva.)
Zayin: A se’ah of truma which fell into one hundred (se’ah of chulin), he picked it up and it fell into another, and he picked that up again and if fell into another, behold this is mutar until there is more truma than chulin (in the first bunch).
Chet: A se’ah of truma which fell into one hundred (se’ah of chulin), and he didn’t pick it up before another se’ah fell in, is assur.  Rabi Shimon allows it.
Tet: A se’ah of truma that fell into a hundred (se’ah of chulin), and he ground and they became less, just as the chulin became less, so too the truma became less, and it is mutar.  A se’ah or truma which fell into less than one hundred (se’ah or chulin), and he ground it and it became more, just as the chulin increased the truma increased, so it is assur.  If he knows the chulin is of superior quality than the truma, it’s mutar.  A se’ah of truma that fell into less than a hundred (se’ah of chulin), and afterwards more chulin fell in, if it was by accident, it’s mutar, but if intentionally, it’s assur.
