Aleph: A stolen or dry lulav (palm frond) is invalid, that of an ashera (idolatry) or wayward city is pasul.  If its tip is cut off or its leaves separated, it is invalid.  If they spread abort, it is valid.  Rabi Yehuda says, one may tie them on top.  The thorn palms of the iron mountain are valid.  A lulav which has three tfachim with which to shake is valid.
Bet: A dry or stolen hadas (myrtle branch) is invalid, that of an ashera or wayward city is invalid.  If its tip cut off, its leaves separated, or its berries were greater (in number) than its leaves, it’s invalid, and if they are less, it’s valid.  And they (the berries) are not removed on Yom Tov.
Gimmel: A stolen or dry arava (willow branch) is invalid, that of an ashera or wayward city is invalid.  If its tip was broken off, its leaves separated, and mountain willow, is invalid.  If it shriveled, some of its leaves fell off, or one of a field is valid.
Daled: Rabi Yishma’el says, three hadasim, two aravot, one lulav, and one etrog, even if two (hadasim) are broken and one isn’t.  Rabi Tarfon says, even if three of them are broken.  Rabi Akiva says, just as the lulav is one and the etrog is one, so too the hadas is one and the arava is one.
Hay: A stolen or dried etrog (citron) is invalid, of ashera or a wayward city is invalid.  One of orla is invalid, one of tame truma is invalid.  One of tahor truma he shouldn’t take, but if he did, it’s valid.  One of dmai, Beit Shamay invalidates, and Beit Hillel validate.  Of ma’aser Sheni in Yerushalayim he shouldn’t take, but if he took, it’s valid.
Vav: If there were scabs on most of it, its pitom separated, it was peeled, it was cracked open, or it was pierced and any amount was lost, it’s invalid.  If there were scabs on part of it, its stem was separated, or it was pierced and nothing was missing, it’s valid.  An Ethiopian etrog is invalid.  And one which is green like a leek, Rabi Meir validates, and Rabi Yehuda invalidates.
Zayin: The measurement of the smallest etrog, Rabi Meir says, like a walnut, and Rabi Yehuda says, a kbeitza.  And the large, for one to hold two in one hand according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Yossi says, even one in two hands.
Chet: One does not bind the lulav (to the other species) except for with its own species according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Meir says, even with string.  Rabi Meir said, there was a story with the people of Yerushalayim that they would bind their lulavim with threads of gold.  They said to him, they would bind it with its own species below.
Tet: And where would they shake (the lulav during Hallel)?  In “hodu la’Hashem,” at the beginning and end, and in “ana Hashem hoshi’a na,” according to Beit Hillel.  Beit Shamay said, even in “ana Hashem hatzlicha na.”  Rabi Akiva said, I watched Raban Gamliel and Rabi Yehoshua, for all the nation would shake their lulavim, and they only shook in “ana Hashem hoshi’a na.”  One who came from a journey and didn’t have with him a lulav to take, when he gets into his house, he will take on his table.  If he didn’t take in the morning, he takes in the afternoon, for the entire day is valid for lulav.
Yud: One who a slave, woman, or minor read (Hallel) for him (if he is illiterate) answers (repeats) after them what they say, and it will be a curse on him.  If an adult was reading for him, he answers after him, “hallelya.”
Yud Aleph: A place where they were accustomed to repeating (the end of Hallel), they must repeat, and (a place which has a custom to) say once, must say once.  One who buys a lulav from his friend on shvi’it gives him an etrog as a gift, since he is not allowed to buy it on shvi’it.
Yud Bet: Originally, the lulav was taken in the Beit Hamikdash seven days and in the country one.  From when the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed, Raban Yochanan ben Zakai instituted that the lulav would be taken in the country seven days, as a remembrance of the Beit Hamikdash and that the day of shaking (the new grain, on 16 nisan), the whole day is assur (to eat the new grain).
Yud Gimmel: The first day of Yom Tov of Sukkot which falls out on Shabbat, the entire nation lays their lulavim in the shul.  The next day when they get up and come, everyone recognizes his, and takes it.  For the Chachamim said, a person does not fulfill his obligation on the first Yom Tov of Sukkot with his friend’s lulav, and on the other days of Sukkot, a person does fulfill his obligation with his friend’s lulav.
Yud Daled: Rabi Yossi says, The first day of Yom Tov of Sukkot which falls out on Shabbat, and he forgot and brought his lulav out into the public domain, he’s patur, since he took it out with a right.
Tet Vav: A woman can take it from the hand of her son or the hand of her husband and return it to the water (where the lulav was stored) on Shabbat.  Rabi Yehuda says, on Shabbat we return, on Yom Tov one may add (water) and on Chol Hamo’ed one may change (the water).  A minor who knows how to shake is chayav in lulav.
