Aleph: One who brings a get from overseas and says, before me it was written, but not before me it was signed; (he says,) before me it was signed, but not, before me it was written; before me all of it was written and before me half of it was signed (only one witness); or, before me half of it was written and before me it was signed, it is invalid.  If one (person) says, before me it was written, and one (other person) says, before me it was signed, it is invalid.  If two say, before us it was written and one says, before me it was signed, it is invalid, and Rabi Yehuda validates.  If one says, before me it was written and two say, before us it was signed, it is valid.
Bet: If it was written during the day (the date of which appears on the get) and signed during the day, (written) during the night and signed during the night, during the night and signed during the day, it is valid (for all parts were done on the date written on the get).  During the day and signed at night (which constitutes the beginning of the next day), it’s invalid.  Rabi Shimon validates, for Rabi Shimon would say, all documents which are written during the day and signed at night arte invalid, except for the gittin of women.  
Gimmel: They may write (the document) with anything, with ink, with sam (a colored earth), with sikra (a red dye), gum resin, or calcanthum, with anything which marks (lastingly).  They may not write with liquids (food dyes), fruit juice, or with anything which does not last.  They may write on anything, on olive leaf; on a cow’s horn, and he gives her the cow; (even) on a slave’s hand, and he gives her the slave. Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, they may not write on something alive or on foods.
Daled: They may not write on something attached to the ground.  If he wrote it while (the object was) attached, he detached it (from the ground), signed it, and gave it to her, it’s valid.  Rabi Yehuda invalidates until its writing and signing are on something detached.  Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira says, they may not write on erased paper or on blotting paper because he can forge them (they are easy to erase unnoticeably), and the Chachamim validate.
Hay: All are valid to write a get, even one who is deaf-dumb, mentally infirm, or a minor.  A woman may write her own get, and a man may write his receipt (which the wife gives him upon receiving her ktuba), for the enactment of the get is only with its signing.  All are valid to deliver a get, except for a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, minor, blind person, and non-Jew.
Vav: If a minor received (a get to deliver) and he became an adult, a deaf-dumb person and he became of sound-senses, a blind person and he regained sight, a mentally infirm person he became competent, or he was a non-Jew and converted, it’s invalid.  But, if he was of sound senses, he became deaf-dumb, and returned to being of sound senses; a sighted person, he became blind, and became sighted again; or was competent, became mentally infirm, and then competent, he’s valid.  This is the general rule, all whose beginning and end is with knowledge (competence) is valid.
Zayin: Even a woman who isn’t believed to say (about a woman), her husband died (and she can remarry, these are women who have interests in seeing the woman getting divorced), are believed to bring her get, (they are) her mother-in-law, her mother-in-law’s daughter, her rival (another wife of her husband), her sister-in-law, and the daughter of her husband.  What is the difference between (bringing) a get and (testifying about) dying?  That the writing proves.  A woman herself may bring her get (to a court which will allow her to remarry), she only needs to say, before me it was signed.
