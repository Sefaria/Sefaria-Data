Aleph: A young woman who was seduced, her (payments for) embarrassment, stigma, and fine are for her father, and for distress is her catch.  Is she stood in judgment (sued) before the father died, behold they are the father’s.  If the father died, behold they are the brothers’ (as inheritance).  If she didn’t manage to sue before the father died, they are hers.  If she sued before she became an adult, they are the father’s.  If the father died, they are the brothers’.  If she didn’t manage to sue before she became an adult, they are hers.  Rabi Shimon says, if she didn’t manage to collect (the monies owed) before her father died, behold they are hers.  The work of her hands and things she finds, even if she did not collect (money for these things which belong to her father in life), and her father died, they belong to her brothers (the inheritors).
Bet: One who betroths his daughter (to a man), she got divorced, she was betrothed, and she became a widow, her ktuba is his (her father’s).  If he married her, she got divorced, married, and became a widow, her ktuba is hers.  Rabi Yehuda says, the first (ktuba she got from the divorce) is the father’s.  They said to him, from when she married her father has no right in her.
Gimmel: A convert whose daughter converted with her, and she had sex in the way of a whore, behold she (dies) by strangulation (even if she was betrothed and would normally get stoning), and she has neither the opening of her father’s house (from where she is led if she is stoned) or the hundred sela (normally paid to a woman’s father if her husband falsely denies her virginity).  If she was conceived not in kdusha (when her mother was not Jewish) and was born in kdusha (her mother converted during the pregnancy), behold, she is with stoning.  And she has neither the opening of her father’s house nor the hundred sela.  If her conception and birth was in kdusha, behold she is like a bat yisra’el for all things.  If she has a father, but she does not have the opening of her father’s house (as in if her father is homeless) or she has the opening of her father’s house but no father (if he died but she lives in the house), behold she is by stoning, it is not said, “the opening of her father’s house” except as a commandment (and not a prerequisite).
Daled: A father has a right with (regard to) his daughter’s betrothal by money, document, and sex, and has a right with her findings, the work of her hands, and annulling her vows.  He accepts her get (for her) but does not benefit (from melog property of hers) in her life (but he inherits it if she dies).  If she married, the husband is greater than him in that he benefits in her life, is chayav for her sustenance, her ransom, and her burial.  Rabi Yehuda says, even the poorest in yisra’el shall not do less (at her funeral) than two flutes and a wailing woman.
Hay: She is always in the authority of the father until she enters into the authority of her husband with marriage.  If the father handed her over to the messengers of the husband, behold she is under the authority of the husband.  If the father went with the messengers of the husband, or messengers of the father went with the messengers of the husband, behold she is under the authority of the father.  If the messengers of the father handed her over to the messengers of the husband, behold she is under the authority of the husband.
Vav: The father is not chayav in the nourishment of his daughter.  This is a midrash which Rabi Elazar ben Azarya expounded before the Chachamim in Kerem Beyavne, “the sons will inherit and the daughters will be (given stipends to be) nourished,” (talking about what is given after the father dies), just as the sons do not inherit after the death of the father, so too the daughter doesn’t get nourishment until after the death of their father.
Zayin: If he didn’t write her a ktuba, a virgin collects two hundred and a widow a maneh, because it is a condition of the court.  If he wrote for her a field worth a maneh instead of two hundred zuz and didn’t write for her all property which I have are responsible (for filling in the amount) of your ktuba, he is chayav, for it is a condition of the court.
Chet: If he didn’t write her, if you are taken captive I will ransom you and return you to me as my wife, and by a kohenet, I will return you to your town (for she is assur to a kohen), he’s chayav, for it is a condition of the court.
Tet: If she was taken captive, he is chayav to redeem her.  And if he says, here is her get and her ktuba let her ransom herself, he does not have the right.  If she was struck (with illness) he must help her recover.  If he said, here is her get and her ktuba, let her heal herself, he has the right.
Yud: If he didn’t write for her, male children you will have by me will inherit your ktuba in addition to what they share with their brothers (from other women), he’s chayav (to fulfill this condition) because it’s a condition of the court.
Yud Aleph: (If he writes) female children which you will have from me will live in my house and be nourished from my property until they are married to men, he is chayav, for it is a condition of the court.
Yud Bet: (If he wrote) you will sit in my house and be nourished from my property all the days you are a widow in my house, he’s chayav, for it is a condition of the court.  The people of Yerushalayim would write like this.  The people of the Galil would write like the people of Yerushalayim.  The people of Yehuda would write, (she would live in the house) until the heirs give her her ktuba.  That way, if the heirs want, they can give her her ktuba and dismiss her.
