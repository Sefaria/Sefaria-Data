Aleph: One may not take truma from pure on impure, but if you did, it’s truma.  They really said, if a dried-fig-cake had a part which became tame, you may take from the tahor for the tame.  So too on a bundle of vegetables or a heap.  If there were two cakes, bundles, or heaps, one tame and one tahor, he may not take from this on that.  Rabi Eliezer says, you may take from the tahor on the tame.
Bet: One may not take from the tame on the tahor, if he did accidentally, it’s truma, but if he did intentionally, it’s not.  So to with a Levi who had ma’aser tevel (trumat ma’aser hadn’t been taken) if he separates and goes along receiving (based on his original separation), accidentally, what he did is done, intentionally, he did nothing.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he knew about this before hand, even if he did it accidentally, he did nothing.
Gimmel: One who immerses utensils on Shabbat, if it was accidentally, he may use them, if intentionally he may not.  One who takes ma’aser or cooks on Shabbat, if it’s an accident, he may eat, but if he did it intentionally, he may not eat.  If he plants a tree on Shabbat, accidentally he may leave it, if intentionally, he must uproot it.  But if it’s shvi’it, whether accidentally or intentionally, he must uproot.
Daled: One may not take from one species for a different species, and if he took, his truma isn’t truma.  All types of wheat are one.  All types of figs, dried figs, and fig cake count as one, and he may take from one on the other.  Wherever there is a kohen, he takes from the choice (fresh), but wherever there is no kohen, he must take from what keeps best.  Rabi Yehuda says, he always takes from the choice.
Hay: One should take a whole, small onion rather than half of a large onion (it keeps better).  Rabi Yehuda says, no, rather half the large onion (it is choice).  And such Rabi Yehuda would say, one may take from town onions on village ones, but not from village on town, for the town onions are food of the upper class.
Vav: One may take from oil-olives for pickle-olives, but not vice versa, and non-cooked wine on cooked, but not vice versa.  This is the general rule, anything which is kilayim together can’t have truma taken from one on the other, even the choice on the inferior.  But everything which isn’t kilayim, one may take from the choice on the inferior, but not vice versa.  But if he took from the inferior on the choice, it is truma, except for darnel on wheat, for it’s not food.  And squash and cucumber are one type.  Rabi Yehuda says, two.
