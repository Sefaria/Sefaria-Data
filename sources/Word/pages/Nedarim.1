Aleph:  All substitute words for vows (swears which declare an object to be like a forbidden object, removing the right to any benefit from the taker of the vow) are like vows, and (substitute words for) bans are like bans, oaths (swears which prohibit a certain action or thing) are like oaths, and nezirut is like nezirut.  One who says to his friend, I am vowed against you, I am separated from you, or I am distanced from you, for I will not eat of yours and I will not taste of yours, he’s assur.  I am excommunicated from you, Rabi Akiva was inclined to be stringent with this.  (If he said) like the vows of the wicked, he made a vow by nazir, korban (declaring an animal a korban), and oath.  Like the vows of the scrupulous, he said nothing (for the scrupulous do not take vows).  Like their (the scrupulous) donations, he made a vow by nazir and korban.
Bet: One who says to his friend, ‘konam’, ‘konach’, (or) ‘konas’, behold these are substitutes for korban.  ‘Cherek’, ‘cherech’, ‘cheref’, behold these are substitutes for cherem.  ‘Nazik’, ‘nazi’ach’, ‘paziach’, behold these are substitutes for nezirut.  ‘Shvuta’, ‘shkuka’, a vow by mota (mota is the substitute) these are substitutes for shvua.
Gimmel: One who says, not chulin I will not eat by you (your food will be as not chulin to me, or, your food will be as) not kosher, not allowed, tahor, tame, notar, or pigul, it’s assur. (If he says your food is) like imra (a lamb to be slaughtered), like sheds (which hold korbanot), like wood (for the mizbe’ach), like fires, like the mizbe’ach, like the sanctuary, like Yerushalayim, or if he made a vow by one of all of the tools of the mizbe’ach, even though he didn’t mention a korban, behold he vowed with a korban.  Rabi Yehuda says, one who said ‘Yerushalayim’ didn’t say anything.
Daled: One who says, korban, olah, chatat, toda, or shlamim that I won’t eat of yours, he’s assur, and Rabi Yehuda allows.  Hakorban, kekorban, korban that I will eat of yours, he’s assur.  Lakorban I will not eat of yours, Rabi Meir prohibits.  One who says to his friend, konam my mouth that speaks with you (he must use an object to prohibit, here using it to prohibit speaking to his friend), my hand doing with you, my foot walking with you, he’s assur.
