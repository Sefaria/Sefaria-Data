Aleph: At first anyone who wanted to lift (ashes) from the mizbe’ach could lift, and when there were many, they would run and go up the ramp and whoever came four amot before his friend would win.  And if they were equal, the one in charge would say to them, stick out a finger (so he would go around until a specified number, and the one who it landed out on would get the job).  And what do they put out?  One or two, and they do not put out a thumb in the Beit Hamikdash.
Bet: One they were equal and they ran up the ramp and one pushed his friend, and fell and broke his foot.  And since the court saw that they were coming to danger they instituted that they will not lift from the mizbe’ach except by lot.  There were four lots there, and this is the first lot.
Gimmel: The second lot (is) who slaughters, who sprinkles, who cleans the inner mizbe’ach, who cleans the menorah, and who brings the limbs up the ramp (and the limbs are) the head and the leg, the two front legs, the rump and the foot, the breast and the neck, the two flanks, the entrails, the fine flour, the chavitin (the meal offering of the kohen gadol), and the wine.  Thirteen kohanim won in it.  Ben Azay said before Rabi Akiva in the name of Rabi Yehoshua, the way it walked (the front most parts first) was (the way it) was offered.
Daled: The third lot (was announced as) those who are new to (never have offered) the incense come and draw lots.  And the fourth, new and old, who takes limbs up from the ramp to the mizbe’ach.
Hay: A tamid was offered by nine (kohanim), ten, eleven, and twelve, no less and no more.  How?  By itself it was nine.  On sukkot, in the hand of them there was the dish of water, behold there are ten.  If it is ben ha’arbayim it was by eleven, nine for it and two had with them two logs of wood.  And on Shabbat, eleven, nine for itself and two with dishes in hand of frankincense of the showbreads, and on Shabbat Sukkot, (it was twelve, eleven plus) in the hand of one the dish of water.
Vav: A ram was offered by eleven, the meat by five, the entrails, fine flour, and wine by two each.
Zayin: A bull was offered by twenty-four, the head and the leg, the head by one and the leg by two.  The rump and the foot, the rump by two and the foot by two.  The breast and the neck, the breast by one and the neck by three.  Two forelegs by two, the two flanks by two, and the entrails, fine flour, and wine by three each.  What is this talking about?  In public offerings.  But in private offerings, if he wants to offer, he offers.  The flaying and dismembering of these and those (both types of offerings) are the same.
