Aleph: Lulav (taking the four species) and arava (aravot were brought to the mizbe’ach, were observed for) six or seven (days), Hallel and festivity eight, sukka and the water libation seven, and the flute (instruments played during the water libation) five or six.
Bet: Lulav seven how?  If the first Yom Tov fell out on Shabbat (they would still take and so) lulav (was taken) seven (days).  And all other days (the first day fell out, they would take the lulav) six.
Gimmel: Arava seven, how?  The seventh day of arava fell out on Shabbat, arava seven.  And (if it fell out on any other day), six.
Daled: How is the mitzva of lulav (done on Shabbat)?  If the first Yom Tov fell out on Shabbat, they would bring their lulavim to the temple mount, and the beadles would receive (the lulavim) from them and lay them out on the portico, and the elderly leave theirs in a chamber.  And they instructed them to say, whoever my lulav winds up in his hands, behold it is a gift for him.  The next day they would wake up and come and the beadles would throw them before them (the people) and they would snatch and hit each other.  And when the court saw that they came into the hands of danger (it was dangerous for people), they established that each person would take in their house.
Hay: How is the mitzva of arava (done)?  There was a place below Yerushalayim called Motza.  They would go down there and pick large young willow branches and place them at the sides of the mizbe’ach with their tips bending over the mizbe’ach.  They blew a tkiya, a trua, and a tkiya.  Every day they would circle the mizbe’ach once and say, “ana Hashem hoshi’a na, ana Hashem hatzlicha na.”  Rabi Yehuda says, “ani vaho hoshi’a na.”  And that day (the seventh day of Sukkot) they would circle the mizbe’ach seven times.  When they would leave (after the aravot service) what would they say?  “Beauty is yours, mizbe’ach, beauty is yours, mizbe’ach.”  Rabi Eliezer says, “To Hashem and to you, mizbe’ach, to Hashem and to you, mizbe’ach.”
Vav: As it was performed on a weekday it was performed on Shabbat, only they would pick it on erev Shabbat and leave it in golden basins so they don’t whither.  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka says, they would bring branches of palm and beat them on the floor next to the mizbe’ach, and that day was called the day of the beating of the branches.
Zayin: Immediately after (the end of Sukkot) the children would release their lulavim and eat their etrogim.
Chet: Hallel and festivity eight, how?  It teaches that a person is obligated in Hallel, festivity, and honoring the last day of holiday just as all the days of Sukkot.  Sukkot seven how?  If he finished eating he does not take down his sukka, rather he removes the vessels from mincha (time) and on because of honor of the last of Yom Tov.
Tet: The water libation how?  A dish of gold holding three log was filled from the Shilo’ach (a river).  They got to the water gate they blew a tkiya, trua, tkiya.  He (the kohen performing the libation) came up the ramp and turned left, and there were two silver bowls there.  Rabi Yehuda says, they were of plaster, but their insides were blackened because of the wine (that was usually poured in them).  And they were pierced like two thin snouts, one was widened and one was thick, such that they (the wine, which was concentrated, and the water) finish (empty) at once.  The west was of water and the east of wine.  If he poured water into (the bowl) of wine or wine into the one of water, he fulfills.  Rabi Yehuda says, he would do a libation with a log all the eight (days).  And to the one doing to libation they said to him, raise your hand.  For once one poured the libation on his feet, and the whole nation pelted him with etrogim.
Yud: Like what they did on the weekdays, so too they did on Shabbat, but he would fill from erev Shabbat a golden barrel which is not kodesh from the Shilo’ach and place it in the chamber.  If it spilled or became exposed he would fill from the sink, for wine and water which were exposed are invalid for the mizbe’ach.
