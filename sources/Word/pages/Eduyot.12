Aleph: Rabi Yishma’el says, three stones one next to the other next to a Markulis (image of Mercury, who was worshipped by throwing stones near his idol) they are assur (for they were clearly thrown there), but two are mutar (for they may be there by chance).  Chachamim say, which appear with it (near it) are assur, those which do not appear with it are mutar.
Bet: If he found on its head (on an idol of Markulis) money, clothing, or vessels, behold these are mutar (for they are not the normal decoration for the idol).  (If he found on it) clusters of grapes, crowns of stalks (of grain), wines, oils fine flour, or anything similar to these on it or offered on its altar, it is assur.
Gimmel: Avoda zara which had a garden or a bathhouse (one may benefit from them not for a fee (for the fee is for the avoda zara), but one does not benefit from them for a fee.  If it (the garden or bathhouse) was for it and of others, one may benefit from them whether for a fee or not.
Daled: The avoda zara of a non-Jew is assur immediately, but that of a Jew (made by a Jew) is not assur until it is worshipped.  A non-Jew can annul his avoda zara and that of his friend, but a Jew does not annul the avoda zara of a non-Jew.  One who annuls avoda zara has nullified its accessories.  If he annulled its accessories, its accessories are mutar but it is assur.
Hay: How does he annul it?  If he cut off the tip of its ear, the tip of its nose, the tip of its finger, or even battered it without removing from it, it is annulled.  If he spat before it, urinated before it, dragged it, or threw excrement on it, behold this is not annulled (for sometimes they would do this to idols but then go back to worshipping them).  If he sold it or gave it as collateral, Rabi says, he annulled it, but Chachamim say, he didn’t annul it.
Vav: Avoda zara which its worshipers abandoned in a time of peace (out of their own will) is mutar, but (if they abandoned it) in a time of war (which was because of the war) it is assur.  Pedestals of kings, behold these are mutar because they set them up at the time that the kings pass.
Zayin: they asked the elders in Romi (Rome), if He (Hashem) does not want avoda zara, why does he not annul it?  They said to them, if they worshipped a thing which had no purpose in the world, He would annul it, but they worship the sun, the moon, the stars, and the constellations, will He destroy His world because of mentally infirm people?  They said to them, if so, he should destroy a thing which has no purpose in the world and leave a thing that the world needs.  They (the Rabbis) said to them, we would also be strengthening their worship, for they would say, know that they are gods, for they were not annulled.
Chet: One may buy a trodden winepress (one which has pressed grapes in it) from a non-Jew, although he may take (crushed grapes) in his hand and put them in a pile (where grapes are left so their juices are collected).  And it is no made into libation wine until it goes down into the hole (where it is fermented).  If it went down into the hole, what is in the hole is assur and the rest is mutar.
Tet: One may step (on grapes) in a winepress with a non-Jew, but one may not harvest grapes with him.  A yisra’el who makes (works) while tame, one may not step or harvest grapes with him, but one may bring barrels with him to the winepress with him and they may bring (barrels) with him from the winepress.  A baker who makes while tame, one may not knead with him or roll with him, but one may bring bread with him to the bakery.
Yud: A non-Jew who is found standing at the side of a pit of wine, if he has a lien on it, it is assur, if he does not have a lien on it, it is mutar (for if he had rights to it he may have touched it, but if he has no rights, he would not touch it).  If he fell into the pit and they brought him up (but he died), if he tested it with a reed, he flicked out a hornet from it with a reed, or he slapped a barrel which was boiling (he wicked off foam from a barrel), there was a case of each of these an they said, it may be sold (to non-Jews), and Rabi Shimon allows it.  If he (a non-Jew) took a barrel and he threw it in his anger into a pit, this was a case and they validated it (to be benefited from).
Yud Aleph: One who makes the wine of a non-Jew tahor (by making it for him) and put it in his domain, a house which is open to the public domain, in a city in which there are non-Jews and Jews, it is mutar.  In a city which is all non-Jews, it is assur, until he puts a guard, and the guard does no have to sit and guard, even if he enters and enters it is mutar.  Rabi Shimon ben Elazar says, any domain of non-Jews is one (it is all assur).
Yud Bet: One who makes tahor wine for a non-Jew and puts it in his (the non-Jew’s) domain, and that one writes for him, I received money from you, it is mutar (for he acknowledges that the wine is from a Jew and will not touch it).  But, if a yisra’el wants to take it out, but (the non-Jew) does not let him until he gives him his money, this was a case in Beit She’an, and the Chachamim forbade it.
