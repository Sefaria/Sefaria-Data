Aleph: Rabi Yehuda ben Bava testified about five things, that (female, orphan) minors may refuse (contracted marriage), that we allow a woman to marry based on one witness (saying that her husband died overseas), a rooster was killed in Yerushalayim for killing a person, that forty day old (or older) wine (exclusively) is made as a libation on the mizbe’ach, and on the (korban) tamid of the morning, that it is offered at four hours (after the start of the day).
Bet: Rabi Yehoshua and Rabi Nechunya ben Elinatan a man from Kfar Habavli testified that the organ of a corpse is tame, for Rabi Eliezer says, they only said (it was tame) about a organ from the living.  They said to him, isn’t it a kal vechomer.  Just as from the living who is pure, an organ separated from him is tame, a corpse, which is tame, shouldn’t it be that an organ separated from it is tame.  He said to them, they only said it about the organ of the living.  And another thing which the tuma of the living is greater than the tuma of the dead, for the living (who is a zav) makes a couch and seat under him (even if he does not touch them, tame to such a point that) it makes a person tame and it makes clothes tame, and on top of him (he makes) a shelf (tame) to make food and drinks tame, which a corpse does not make tame.
Gimmel: A kzayit of flesh which separates from an organ from the living, Rabi Eliezer make tame and Rabi Yehoshua and Rabi Nechunya make tahor.  Bone the size of a grain of barley which separates from an organ from the living, Rabi Nechunya makes tame and Rabi Eliezer and Rabi Yehoshua make tahor.  They said to Rabi Eliezer, what did you see (that made you decide) to make a kzayit of flesh which separates from an organ from the living tame?  We have found that an organ from the living is like a whole corpse, just as a corpse (where) a kzayit of flesh which separated from it is tame, so too an organ from the living, a kzayit from it is tame.  They said to him, no, if you made a kzayit of flesh which separates from a corpse tame, so too you made bone the size of a grain of barley tame, how do you make a kzayit of flesh which separates from an organ from the living tame, for you make a bone the size of a barley grain from it tahor (we see that he does not hold an organ from the living and a corpse to be the same)?  They said to Rabi Nechunya, what did you see to make bone the size of a grain of barley from an organ from the living tame?  He said to them, we found that an organ from the living is like a whole corpse, just as the corpse, bone the size of a grain of barley which is separated from it is tame, also an organ from the living bone the size of a grain of barley will be tame.  They said to him, no, if you make bone the size of a grain of barley which separates from a corpse tame, and so too you make a kzayit of flesh which is separated from it tame, how do make bone the size of a grain of barley which separates from an organ from the living tame and also make a kzayit of flesh which separates from it tahor?  They said to Rabi Eliezer, what did you see to make you disagree with your own opinion?  Either (make) tame in both or tahor in both.  He said to them, the tuma of the flesh is greater than the tuma of the bones, for the flesh works by nevelot and sheratzim (flesh of these classes of makes things tame) which we don’t have by bones.  Another thing, an organ which has on it enough flesh (to be functional, even if it is not a kzayit) makes tame by touching, carrying, and making a tent (with it), if it is missing flesh, it is tame, and if it is missing bones, it is tahor.  They said to Rabi Nechunya, what did you see to make you disagree with your own opinion?  Either (make) tame in both or tahor in both.  He said to them, the tuma of bones is greater than the tuma of flesh, for flesh which separates from the living is tahor, and an organ which separates from it and it is in healthy condition is tame (for it contains bone).  Another thing, a kzayit of flesh makes tame in touching, carrying, and making a tent and most of the bones (of a corpse) makes tame with touching, carrying, and making a tent, if (the full amount of) flesh is missing, it’s tahor, but if most of the bones are missing, even though it is tahor from making tame with a tent (meaning it does not make tame by making a tent) it makes tame by touching and carrying.  Another thing, any flesh of the dead which is less than a kzayit is tahor, most of its structure or its number even if they do not have a rova (a measurement) they make tame.  They said to Rabi Yehoshua, what you see to make them both tahor?  He said to them, no, if you said by a corpse which has a majority, a rova, and decayed matter, will you say by the living which does not have a majority, a rova, or decayed matter?
