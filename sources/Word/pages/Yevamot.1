Aleph: Fifteen women exempt their rivals (other wives of the same man), and the rivals of their rivals (wives from other brothers if one brother already died) from chalitza (rejection of yibum) and yibum (when a man dies without descendants, one of his brothers has a child with one of his wives and the son is named in the dead brother’s memory), forever (as in rivals of rivals of rivals etc. if there are multiple brothers).  These are they, his (the living brother’s) daughter (i.e. if she was his brothers wife), his daughter’s daughter, his son’s daughter, his wife’s daughter, the daughter of her son, the daughter of her daughter, his mother-in-law, his mother-in-law’s mother, his father-in-law’s mother, his sister from his mother (the two brothers must only share a father), his wife’s sister, the wife of his brother from his mother, a wife of a brother who was not in his world (the brother died before he was born), and his daughter-in-law, behold these exempt their rivals, and the rivals of their rivals, from chalitza and yibum forever.   And all of them, if they died, or refused (a minor whose father died may refuse contracted marriage including yibum), or divorced, or if they were found to be incapable of having children, their rivals are exempt.  And you cannot say by his mother-in-law, the mother of his mother-in-law, or the mother of his father-in-law that they are incapable of having children or they refused (only minors may refuse).
Bet: How do they exempt their rivals?  If his daughter or one of all of these inappropriate relations was married to his brother, and he (the dead brother) had another wife, and he died, just as his daughter is patur, so too her rival is patur.  If the rival of his sister went and married another brother of his, and he had another wife and he died, just as the rival of his (the living brother’s) daughter is patur, so too the rival of her rival is patur, even if there are a hundred (brothers, and this happens with all but one who is still alive).  How is it that if they (the forbidden wives) died (etc.), their rivals are permitted?  His daughter or one of these forbidden relationships was married to his brother, and he had another wife, his daughter died or got divorce, and after that his brother died, her rival is allowed.  And all (those who would be forbidden as an adult and) who could refuse but didn’t refuse, her rival can have chalitza but not yibum.
Gimmel: Six forbidden relations are stricter than these, and since they are married to others, their rivals are mutar, his mother, the wife of his father, his father’s sister, his sister from his father, the wife of the brother of his father, and the wife of his brother from his father (i.e. the woman is married to two of his brothers).
Daled: Beit Shamay allows the rivals (of the prohibited women) to the brothers (for yibum or chalitza), and Beit Hillel prohibits.  If they did chalitza, Beit Shamay makes invalid for marrying kohanim (who may not marry a chalitza), and Beit Hillel makes valid (for their chalitza was invalid).  If they did yibum, Beit Shamay validates and Beit Hillel invalidates.  Even though these (Beit Hillel) prohibit (yibum to rivals) and these (Beit Shamay) allow, these (Beit Shamay) invalidate (for marriage after such a yibum) and these (Beit Hillel) validate, Beit Shamay did not refrain from marrying the women of Beit Hillel, and Beit Hillel did not refrain from marrying the women of Beit Shamay.  All (matters of) tahor and tame (by vessels) that these would make tahor and these would make tame they did not refrain from making teharot based on them (they would trust that the other group would only lend them vessels which the borrowers themselves would consider tahor, even though the lender might not agree with the other’s views).
