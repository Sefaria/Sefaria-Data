Aleph: A chatat of fowl which he (the kohen) did (melika on) below (on the bottom half of the mizbe’ach) in the way of a chatat for the sake of a chatat is kasher.  (If he did it) in the way of an chatat but for the sake of an olah, the way of an olah for the sake of a chatat, or like an olah for the sake of an olah, it is pasul.  If he did it above like the way of all of them (any korban), it is pasul.
Bet: An olah of fowl which he did above, like the way of an olah for the sake of an olah, it is kasher.  (If he did it) the way of an olah for the sake of a chatat, it is kasher, only it did not count for the owners.  The way of a chatat for the sake of an olah, it is pasul.  If he did it below like the way of all of them, it is pasul.
Gimmel: And all of them (pasul bird offerings) do not become tame from the place of swallowing (gullet, which is generally the source of tuma from a bird) and one can do me’ila with them, except the chatat of fowl which he did below, like the doing of a chatat for the sake of a chatat.
Daled: An olah of fowl which he did below (on the bottom half of the mizbe’ach), in the way of a chatat, and for the sake of a chatat, Rabi Eliezer says, there is me’ila with it.  Rabi Yehoshua says, there is no me’ila with it.  Rabi Eliezer says, just as a chatat (of fowl), which has no me’ila (if done) for its own sake, when he changes its sake (offers it for the sake of another korban), an olah (of fowl), which there is me’ila with, if he changes its name, isn’t it logical that there is me’ila by it?  Rabi Yehoshua said to him, no, if you say by a chatat which he changes for the sake of an olah, for he changed it for the sake of something which has me’ila, would you say such by an olah which he changed for the sake of a chatat, for he changed it for the sake of something which does not have me’ila.  Rabi Eliezer said to him, behold, holy of holies which he slaughtered in the south (part of the courtyard, whereas the north is their proper place) and he slaughtered for the sake of light holies (which may be slaughtered in the south) will prove (me right), for he changed their sake for something which does not have me’ila, but there is me’ila in them (what he slaughtered), so too you should not wonder by the olah, for even though he changed its sake for something which does not have me’ila, there is me’ila in it (his mistaken korban).  Rabi Yehoshua said to him, no, if you said by the holy of holies which he slaughtered in the south and he slaughtered them for the sake of light holies, for just as he changed their sake to a thing which has issur and heter (parts which have me’ila and parts which don’t), would you say it an olah which he changed its sake to something which is all heter (for it is all allowed to the kohanim)?
Hay: If he did melika with his left (hand), at night, if he slaughtered chulin (non-holy meat) within (the courtyard) or holies outside, they do not become take from the gullet (the source of tuma from a nevela bird, for while its melika was invalid, it makes the bird not a nevela).  If he did melika with a knife (not his nail), he did melika on chulin within, on holies outside, turtledoves which did not reach their (minimum) age, young doves which passed their (maximum) age, if its wing was withered, if its eye was blinded, or if its foot was cut off, it does become tame in its gullet.  This is the general rule, whatever was pasul in the kodesh (sanctuary) does not become tame in the gullet, but whatever wasn’t pasul in the kodesh becomes tame in the gullet.  And all the invalid things which had melika, their melika is pasul but they do not become tame in the gullet.
Vav: If he did melika and found it (the bird) to be a trefa, Rabi Meir says, it does not become tame in the gullet.  Rabi Yehuda says, it becomes tame in the gullet.  Rabi Meir said, just as with the nevela of an animal, which makes tame by touching and carrying, slaughtering makes its being a trefa tahor (meaning) that its (being a) trefa doesn’t (make things) become tame (even though it is a trefa, because it was slaughtered it does not make other things tame), a nevela of fowl, which does not make tame in touching and carrying, isn’t it logical that its slaughtering will make it tahor from its trefa.  Rabi Yossi says, it is enough for it to be like the nevela of an animal, its slaughtering makes it tahor, but not its melika.
