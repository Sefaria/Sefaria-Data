Aleph: An olive tree with a name or renown is never shichicha.  What is this talking about?  It has a name, or a certain act, or a certain place.  Its name, given because it has superior fruit, its acts, that it produces a lot of fruit, its location, that it’s close to a press or a hole in a wall (where he will remember it).  And for all other olive trees, two is shichicha, and three is not.  Rabi Yossi says there is no shichicha by olive trees.
Bet: An olive tree that is in the middle of three rows of trees which between them have two rectangular beds, is not shichicha.  What is this talking about?  When he didn’t start harvesting it.  But if he began it, even if it’s a famed tree, it’s shichicha.  If he left olives under the tree, the olives in the tree aren’t shichicha.  Rabi Meir says, it’s shichicha if the people who check over the trees have passed.
Gimmel: What is peret?  Grapes which fell from the vine in the time of harvest.  He was harvesting and he cut off the bunch, but it got caught in the leaves and fell to the ground, it is for the owner.  One who puts a basket under what he is harvesting is stealing from the poor, as we see in a pasuk.
Daled: What is olelet?  Grapes which are on sprigs which are scattered on the spine (no kateph, on each other’s shoulders), and grapes that aren’t closely clustered (no nateph, grapes which seem to drip off the bunch).  If either the sprigs or the grapes are closely clustered, it counts for the owner.  If it’s not easy to tell the characteristics, it goes to the poor.  Olelet near where the spine meets the shoot, if it gets cut off with the rest of the spine, it’s for the owner, and if not, it’s for the poor.  A cluster with only spine and no sprigs, Rabi Yehuda says it’s a cluster, Chachamim say it’s olelet.
Hay: One who thins in the grapes, Rabi Yehuda says he can thin his and those for the poor.  Rabi Meir says he can thin only those which are his.
Vav: A vineyard in its fourth year, Beit Shamay says you don’t need to pay chomesh if you redeem it, and you don’t have to remove it from you house for Pesach (unlike ma’aser sheni).  And Beit Hillel says you do need (like ma’aser sheni).  Beit Shamay says there is peret and olelet, and the poor have to redeem it themselves.  Beit Hillel says all of it is for the owner.
Zayin: A vineyard that is all olelet, Rabi Eliezer says is for the owner.  Rabi Akiva says it’s for the poor.  Rabi Eliezer said, the pasuk says olelet is when you harvest, if it’s all for the poor, there’s no harvest.  Rabi Akiva said, a pasuk says olelet is by a vineyard, even if it’s all olelet.  If like Rabi Akiva, why is Rabi Eliezer’s pasuk given?  To show that the poor can’t take before the harvest.
Chet: One who makes his vineyard hekdesh before it could be known if there was olelet, the olelet isn’t for the poor.  If it could be determined, the olelet is for the poor.  Rabi Yossi says they have to give the increase of the value of the olelet from the time it became hekdesh to the Beit Hamikdash.  When is a bunch on a trained vine that forms a booth shichicha?  When it is no longer within the harvester’s reach.  What about on a trained vine that is at foot level?  When he passes from it.
