        "One who builds, how much will does he build to become chayav?  One who builds any amount.  And one who unbuilds, hits with a hammer or adze, or bores a hole at all is chayav.  This is the general rule, anyone who does a melacha and his melacha stays on Shabbat, he’s chayav.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, even one who hits with a sledgehammer on the anvil when work is being done is chayav, for it is as if he is improving the work product.", 
        "One who plows any amount, and the one who weeds, cuts, or trims any amount is chayav.  One who collects wood, if to improve, he’s chayav, but if to heat, enough to cook a light egg.  One who collects herbs, if to improve, any amount, but if (to feed) an animal, enough to fill the mouth of a kid.", 
        "One who writes two letters, whether with his right or left (hand), whether of one name (letter, i.e. both the same) or of two names, whether from two dyes, and in any language, he’s chayav.  Rabi Yossi said, they only made two letters chayav because it’s making a mark, for this is how they would write on the beams of the Mishkan, to know which is its pair.  Rabi said, we have found a long name (is used) in place of a long name, like Shem from Shimon or Shmuel, Noach from Nachor, Dan from Daniel, and Gad from Gadiel.", 
        "One who writes two letters in one stint of unawareness is chayav.  If he wrote in ink, sam (a colored earth), sikra (a red dye), gum resin, or calcanthum, with anything which marks (lastingly), the two walls of a corner, the two boards of a writing tablet, and they can be read with one another, he’s chayav.  One who writes on his flesh is chayav.  One who scratches on his flesh, Rabi Eliezer makes chayav a chatat, and Rabi Yehoshua permits it.", 
        "If he wrote with liquids, fruit juices, the dust of roads, dust of a scribe, and anything which doesn’t last, he’s patur.  With the back of his hand, his foot, with his mouth, and his elbow, or if he writes one letter close to what is written, he wrote on top of something written, he intended to write a chet and wrote two zayins, one in the earth and one on a beam, he wrote on two walls of the house, or on two boards of a writing tablet which don’t go together, he’s patur.  If he wrote a letter after an acronym, Rabi Yehoshua ben Bteira makes chayav, and Chachamim allow.", 
        "One who writes two letters in two stints of unawareness, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, Rabi Gamliel makes chayav and Chachamim allow."
