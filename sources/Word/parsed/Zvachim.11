        "Blood of a chatat which was sprayed on clothing, behold it (the clothing) requires washing (in the courtyard) even though the pasuk does not discuss other than those which are eaten (a chatat which is brought on the outer mizbe’ach), as it says, “it shall be eaten in a holy place.”  Whether it is eaten or whether it is an inner (chatat, which is not eaten) it requires washing, as it says, “the manner of the chatat,” one manner for all chata’ot.", 
        "A pasul chatat, its blood does not require washing, whether it was kosher at one time or if it never had a time it was kosher.  Which is that which had a time it was kosher?  One which stayed overnight  (the parts that had to be dealt with were not processed in time), one which became tame, and one which exited (from the courtyard before the sprinkling of the blood).  And which is that which did not have a time it was kosher?  One that was slaughtered (with an intention) out of its time, (was slaughtered with an intention) outside its place, one which invalid people accepted (its blood), or (invalid people) sprinkled its blood.", 
        "If it (blood) sprayed from the neck onto clothing, it does not require washing.  From the horn (of the mizbe’ach) or from the base (of the mizbe’ach, both where blood was sprinkled), it does not require washing.  If it fell on the floor and he collected it (and that got on his clothing), it does not require washing.  Nothing requires washing other blood which was accepted in a vessel and is fit for sprinkling.  If it sprayed on the leather (of the animal) before it was skinned, it (the leather) does not require washing.  (If blood sprayed on the skin of the animal) after it was skinned, it requires washing according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Eliezer says, even after it is skinned it does not require washing.  It (a garment) does not require washing other than the place of the blood, that which is fit to become tame, and that which is fit to be washed.", 
        "Whether a garment, a sack, or leather, they require washing in a holy place.  And the breaking of an earthenware vessel (to purify it) is (done) in a holy place, and the scouring and washing of a copper vessel (to purify it) is in a holy place.  This (washing process) is a stringency by chatat more than holy of holies.", 
        "A garment (which was sprayed with chatat blood) which exited to outside the curtains (of the Beit Hamikdash) comes back in and one washes it in a holy place.  If it became tame outside the curtains, he tears it (to purify it), it comes back in, and he washes it in a holy place.  An earthenware vessel which exited to outside the curtains, it comes back in, and one breaks it in a holy place.  If it became tame outside the curtains, one makes a hole in it, it comes in, and one breaks it in a holy place.", 
        "A copper vessel which exited to outside the curtains, it comes back in and he scours it and washes it in a holy place.  If it became tame outside the curtains, he makes a large hole, it comes in, and he scours and washes it in a holy place.", 
        "Whether he cooked (holy meats) in it (a pot) of if boiling (food which was holy) came upon it, whether the holies of holies or light holies, they (pots) require scouring and washing.  Rabi Shimon says, if he cooked in it from the beginning of the festival, he may cook with it the entire festival (without cleaning it each time), and the Chachamim say (he may put off washing and continue using it) until the time of eating (allowed for the korban which was cooked in it).  Scouring and washing, scouring is like the scouring of a cup (used for benching, on the inside) and washing is like the washing of a cup (on the outside).  Scouring is done with hot water and washing with cold water.  And a skewer and grill, one purifies them with hot water.", 
        "If he cooked in it (a pot) holy foods and chulin (non-holy foods), or holies of holies and light holies, if they (the holier foods) have enough to impart flavor, behold the lighter are eaten like the stricter, but they do not require scouring and washing (which is only required for holies of holies) and (if the stricter were invalid, the lighter) do not invalidate by touching.  A slice (which was invalid) which touched a (valid) slice, or a piece which touched a piece, not the entire slice and not all of the pieces are assure, it is only assur where it absorbed (from the invalid one)."
