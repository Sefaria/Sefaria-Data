        "What is aris (which is considered a vineyard)?  One who plants a row of five vines next to a fence ten tfachim tall (acting as a trellis), or next to ditch tat is ten tfachim deep and four wide, and has the four amot needed for tillage.  Beit Shamay says you measure the four amot from the stalk to the field.  Beit Hillel says from the wall to the field.  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri says all who say like this are wrong!  Only if there are four amot from the stalk to the wall, you give it room for tillage, and sow the rest.  How much tillage space does the vine need?  Six tfachim in all directions, and Rabi Akiva says three.", 
        "An aris that projects from a terrace, Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, if he can stand on the ground and collect all the grapes it prohibits four amot on the field.  If not, it only prohibits what is next to it.  Rabi Eliezer says, also if one plants one row of vines on the ground and one row on a terrace, if the terrace is more than ten tfachim high, they do not combine.  And if it’s shorter, they do combine.", 
        "One who trains a vine over a trellis may not plant under open spaces in the trellis, but if he did, it is not forbidden.  But if the vine grew and covered the seed, it is forbidden.  And so too if he trained it over a non-fruit-bearing tree (serak).", 
        "One who trains a vine on part of a fruit tree can plant seeds under the rest of the tree.  Once Rabi Yehoshua went to Rabi Yishma’el in Kfar Aziz, and showed him a vine trained over part of a fig tree.  He said to him, Can I plant under the rest of the tree?  Rabi Yishma’el said, you may.  He went up with him to Bet Maganya and showed him a vine trained over a branch of a sycamore which had many branches.  Rabi Yishma’el said, under this branch is assur, but under the other branches is mutar.", 
        "What tree is a sarak?  That which produces no fruit.  Rabi Meir says, all trees other than olive and fig trees.  Rabi Yossi says, any tree that would not be planted over an entire field (and is thus tafel to the vine) is a serak.", 
        "Gaps in an aris, if it’s a little more than eight amot, it breaks the aris.  And of all measurements Chachamim gave in a vineyard, this is the only one that has “a little more.”  What are gaps in an aris?  If vines in the middle were destroyed, and there was a row of five vines on each side, if it’s exactly eight amot between them, he may not sow, but if it’s a bit more, you leave tillage room and sow the middle.", 
        "An aris that projects over a wall from the corner and it stops, you leave tillage space and sow the rest.  Rabi Yossi says, if there aren’t four amot along the wall in the stop, you may not sow there.", 
        "Reeds which project from and aris and he avoided cutting them short, what is near them is mutar.  But if he left them to be as a trellis for the new tendrils, it’s assur.", 
        "A tendril that sticks out of an aris, we see it as if a plummet were hanging on it, what is next to it is assur, and so too with a trellised vine.  One who stretched a shoot from tree to tree, under the vine is assur.  If he used a rope or reed-grass to tie a short tendril over a greater distance, under the extension is mutar.  If he laid it out such that the new shoots would grow on it, it is assur."
