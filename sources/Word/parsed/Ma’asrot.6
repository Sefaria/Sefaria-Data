        "Ma’aser sheni, one doesn’t sell it, give it as collateral, trade it, use it as a counterweight (in measuring weight), and one does not say to his friend in Yerushalayim, “here is wine for you, give me oil,” and so too with all other produce.  But you may give one another as a free gift.", 
        "Ma’aser of animals, one may not sell it unblemished and alive or blemished whether slaughtered or alive, and one doesn’t use it to betroth a woman.  The firstborn (by animals) may be sold unblemished and alive or blemished whether slaughtered or alive, and one may betroth a woman with it.  One may not redeem ma’aser sheni with an asimon (an unstamped coin), with an unacceptable coin, or with money that isn’t at that person’s disposal.", 
        "One who buys (in Yerushalayim with money from redeemed ma’aser sheni) an animal for a shlamim offering, or a wild animal for the lust for meat, the hide becomes chulin, even though the hide exceeds the flesh (in value).  Covered jugs of wine, where they normally sell sealed, the jar is chulin.  Walnuts and almonds, their shells are chulin.  Wine made from grape residue, before it turns, it may not be bought with ma’aser money, but once it has turned, it may be bought with ma’aser money.", 
        "One who buys (in Yerushalayim with money from redeemed ma’aser sheni) a wild animal for a shlamim offering, or a domesticated animal for the lust for meat, the hide doesn’t become chulin.  Jugs of wine, whether covered or not, where they normally sell unsealed, the jar isn’t chulin.  Baskets of olives or grapes with the vessel, the value of the vessel doesn’t become chulin (so he must use that value to buy more food).", 
        "One who buys water, salt, produce attached to the ground, or produce that can’t make it to Yerushalayim, he hasn’t bought ma’aser.  One who accidentally buys produce (with ma’aser sheni money, and the produce won’t make it to Yerushalayim), (the seller) must return the money.  If it was intentional, they must take the produce to Yerushalayim and eat it.  If there is not Beit Hamikdash, he must let it rot.", 
        "One who accidentally buys an animal (with ma’aser sheni money), (the seller) must return the money.  If it was intentional, he must bring it to Yerushalayim and eat it.  If there is no Beit Hamikdash, he must (abandon it and when it dies) bury it with its hide.", 
        "One may not buy slaves, maidservants, land, and impure animals with ma’aser sheni money, and if one did, he must eat (buy produce) according to their value.  One does not bring the offerings of a zav, zava, or woman who just gave birth, chatat, or asham with money of ma’aser sheni, and if he did, he must eat according to their value.  This is the general rule, anything which isn’t food, drink, or ointment (which he bought) from ma’aser sheni money, he eats according to its value."
