        "A woman whose husband went overseas, they came and told her, your husband died, and she married.  Then her husband came, she exits from both, she needs a get from both, and she doesn’t get her ktuba, benefit, nourishment, or depreciation on either.  If she took (any of the above) she returns it.  A child is a mamzer from either one.  Neither one can become tame for her (of he is a kohen) and neither one has a right in something she finds, the work of her hands, or to nullify her vows.  If she was a bat yisra’el, she is pasul from kehuna, a bat levi, (she is pasul) from ma’aser, and a bat kohen from truma.  And neither (husband’s sons) inherit the ktuba.  And if they (the husbands) died neither’s brother does chalitza or yibum.  Rabi Yossi says, her ktuba (comes from) the property of the first.  Rabi Eliezer says, the first has a right to what she finds, the work of her hands, and to nullify her vows.  Rabi Shimon says, sex with or chalitza from his (the first husband’s) brothers exempts her rival, and a child from her isn’t a mamzer.  And if she married without right (from the court) she is allowed to return to him (the first husband).", 
        "If she married based on the court (allowing her), she exits and is patur from a korban (she would normally bring a chatat).  If she married not based on the court, she exits and is chayav a korban.  The power of the court is greater, for it can exempt her from a korban.  If a court allowed her to marry and she went and acted improperly (married an improper person she is chayav a korban, for they only allowed her to marry (properly).", 
        "A woman whose husband and son went overseas, they came and told her, your husband died and afterwards your son died (so since she had a son she doesn’t need yibum), and she married.  Afterwards, they told her, the reverse happened (the son died first so she needs yibum), she exits and (any) child (of the) first and last (husbands) is a mamzer.  They said to her, your son died and then your husband died, and afterwards they told her, the reverse happened, she exits, and the first and last child is a mamzer.  If they told her, your husband died, and she married, and then they came and told her, he was (in actuality) alive but he died, she exits and the child of the first is a mamzer, but the last is not a mamzer.  They said to her, your husband died and she was engaged, and after that her husband came, he is allowed to return to him.  Even though the last one gave her a get, he didn’t make her pasul from kohanim.  Rabi Elazar ben Mattia expounded this, “and a woman divorced from her husband,” and not from a man who isn’t her husband.", 
        "One whose wife went overseas and then they came and told him, your wife died, he married her sister and after that his wife came back, he is allowed to return to her.  He is allowed to the relatives of the second, and she (the second wife) is allowed to his relatives.  And if the first died, he is allowed for the second.  They said to him, your wife died and he married her sister, then afterwards they said to him, she was living but she died, the child of the first is a mamzer, and the last is not a mamzer.  Rabi Yossi says, all who are pasul because of others, are pasul in their own hands, and all who aren’t pasul because of others, aren’t pasul in their own hand (if two brothers marry two sisters, any combination where one makes the wife of the other pasul, he also makes his wife pasul).", 
        "They (witnesses) said to him, your wife died, and he married her sister from her father, she died, and he married her sister (of the new wife) from her mother, she died, and he married her sister from her father, and she died and he married her sister from her mother, and they were all found alive, he is allowed to the first, third, and fifth, and their rivals are patur (from yibum), and he is assur to the second and fourth and sex with either of them does not exempt their rivals.  And if he had sex with the second after the first died, he is allowed to the second and fourth and exempts their rivals, and is assur to the third and fifth and sex with either of them does not exempt his rivals.", 
        "(A boy) nine years and one day old, he invalidates his brothers (if he makes an act of yibum such as a contractual marriage) and the brothers invalidate him, except that he invalidated only (if her act is) first, and they invalidate if their act is at first or at the end (even though they would be invalid to her, they also invalidate their brother).  How?  One who is nine years and one day old who has sex with his yevama invalidated his brothers.  If he brothers had sex with her, they made a contractual marriage for her, they gave a get, or they did chalitza, they made her invalid to him.", 
        "One who is nine years and on day old who has sex with his yevama, and afterwards his brother who is nine years and one day old has sex with her, he (the second) invalidated her (to the first).  Rabi Shimon says he didn’t invalidate.", 
        "One who is nine years and on day old who has sex with his yevama and afterwards had sex with her rival, he invalidated himself.  Rabi Shimon says, he didn’t invalidate.  One who is nine years and on day old who has sex with his yevama and died, she does chalitza but not yibum.  If he married a woman and died behold she is patur.", 
        "One who is nine years and on day old who has sex with his yevama, and when he grew up (to maturity) he married another woman and died, if he didn’t have sex with the first once since he grew up, the first does chalitza and not yibum, and the second can do chalitza or yibum.  Rabi Shimon says, he can do yibum to whichever he wants, and does chalitza for the second.  (All of these cases are) whether he’s nine years and one day old or twenty years old, if he didn’t have two (pubic) hairs."
