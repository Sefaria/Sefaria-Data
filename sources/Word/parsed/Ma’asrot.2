        "If one (an am ha’aretz) was passing through the street and said, take some figs for yourselves, they may take and are exempt.  Therefore, if they take them into their house, they take ma’asrot as if certainly tevel.  If he said, take some home, one may not eat it randomly.  Therefore if you take it into your house, you take ma’asrot as dmai.", 
        "If they were sitting in a gateway or a shop, and he said, take some figs, one may eat and they are exempt, and the owner of the gateway or shop is chayav.  Rabi Yehuda says they are exempt, unless he turns his head (and isn’t seen eating) or moves (and is no longer is the place of exemption).", 
        "One who takes fruit from the Galil to Yehuda or up to Yerushalayim, he may eat from them until he reaches his destination, and so too on the way back.  Rabi Meir says until he reaches the place he will spend Shabbat.  And peddlers who go from town to town may eat until they come to the place they will sleep.  Rabbi Yehuda says, the first house (in the town) is considered his house.", 
        "Fruits from which one took truma before their work was finished, Rabi Eliezer forbids eating from them randomly, and Chachamim allow, except for large baskets of figs.  Large baskets of figs from which he took truma, Rabi Eliezer allows and Chachamim forbid.", 
        "One who says to his friend, take this issar (a coin) in exchange for five figs, he may not eat until he takes ma’asrot according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he eats them one by one, he is patur, but if he eats them together, he is chayav.  Rabi Yehuda says, once there was a rose garden in Yerushalayim and people would sell figs there three or four for an issar, and people never took trumot and ma’asrot.", 
        "One who says to his friend, here is an issar for ten figs I will chose, he may choose and eat (singly or he owes ma’aser).  (If he says) for a cluster of grapes which I will choose, he may pick (singly from the cluster) and eat.  For a pomegranate I will choose, he may pick the seeds and eat.  For a watermelon I will choose, he may cut slices and eat.  But, if he said for these ten figs, for these two clusters, for these two pomegranates, or for these two watermelons, he may eat as usual and is exempt since he bought them while attached to the ground.", 
        "One who hires a worker to help him harvest figs, if the worker said to him, on condition that I may eat figs, he may eat and is exempt.  If he said, on condition that I and my son may eat, or my son will eat (the worth of) my wage, he may eat and be exempt, but his son eats and is obligated.  If he says, so that I may eat during the operation and after the operation, during the operation, he may eat and is patur, after the operation, he may eat and is chayav, for he isn’t eating based on the torah.  This is the general rule, one who eats while entitled by the torah is patur, and when his eating isn’t entitled by the torah, he’s chayav.", 
        "One was working with poor quality figs, he may not eat superior quality figs or poor quality figs, rather he must prevent himself until he gets to the place of the nice figs, and there he may eat.  One who trades with his friend, this one to eat and this one to eat (figs), this one to dry and this one to dry, or this one to eat and this one to dry, is chayav.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he trades for food, chayav, and for drying, patur."
