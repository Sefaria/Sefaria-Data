        "Rabi Yehuda says, there are six things which are leniencies of Beit Shamay and stringencies of Beit Hillel, the blood of nevelot (animals which died of natural causes) Beit Shamay makes tahor and Beit Hillel makes tame.  The egg of a nevela, if (things formed) like it are sold in the shuk it is allowed and if not, it is assur, according to Beit Shamay.  Beit Hillel prohibits (either way).  And they admit by the egg of a trefa (an animal which after slaughtering was found to be unfit) that it is assur, since it grew in something assur.  (Menstrual)  blood of a non-Jew, and the purity blood of a metzora’at (that she sees after the allotted amount of time after she gives birth passes, making her tahor again) Beit Shamay make tahor, and Beit Hillel say, it is like her spit and urine (decreed tame derabanan).  One may eat the produce of shvi’it with thanks or without thanks.  Beit Hillel says, one does not eat except with thanks (such that people will talk to the owner, so if they accidentally come in one of the other six years the owner will tell them).  A flask (which had a hole in it) Beit Shamay says it is tied up and stays (usable, only them can it become tame), and Beit Hillel says (it can become tame) even not tied.", 
        "Rabi Yossi says, six things from the leniencies of Beit Shamay and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, chicken may be raised on a table with cheese but is not eaten (together) according to Beit Shamay, and Beit Hillel says, it is not raised and it is not eaten.  One may give truma of olives on oil and grapes on wine according to Beit Shamay, and Beit Hillel says, one may not give truma (in such a fashion).  One who sows (within) four amot (of vines) in a vineyard, Beit Shamay says, he separated one row (of vines which he may not use because of kilayim) and Beit Hillel says, he separated two rows.  Me’isa (a type of dough) Beit Shamay exempt (from taking challa) and Beit Hillel require.  One may immerse in a torrent (of flowing water as long as there is the sufficient quantity of water in the entire stream) according to Beit Shamay, and Beit Hillel says, one does not immerse.  A convert who converted the night of Pesach, Beit Shamay says, he immerses and eats his (korban) pesach that night, and Beit Hillel says, one who separates from his foreskin is like one who separates from a grave (has seven days of tuma as if he touched a grave).", 
        "Rabi Yishma’el says, three things from the leniencies of Beit Shamay and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, Kohelet (Ecclesiastes) does not make the hands tame (if one touches the scroll) according to Beit Shamay and Beit Hillel says it does.  The waters of sin (water with the ashes of the red heifer which serves to purify) which have done their job, Beit Shamay make tahor and Beit Hillel make tame.  Black cumin, Beit Shamay make tahor (it can never become tame, for it is not considered food) and Beit Hillel make tame (say it can become tame) and so too for ma’asrot (where it only requires if considered a food).", 
        "Rabi Eliezer says, two things from the leniencies of Beit Shamay and the stringencies of Beit Hillel, the blood of a woman who gave birth but did not immerse, Beit Shamay says it is like her spit and urine (which makes moist things tame), and Beit Hillel says, it makes moist and dry tame.  And they agree about one who gave birth while a zava, that it (the blood) make moist and dry tame.", 
        "Four brothers, two of them married two sisters, and those married to the sisters died, behold these (women) get chalitza and not yibum, and if they went ahead and married, they exit (the marriage).  Rabi Eliezer says, Beit Shamay says, they stand (married), and Beit Hillel says, they exit (from the marriage).", 
        "Akavia ben Mahalalel testified to four things.  They (the Chachamim) said to him, Akavia, return in the four things you used to say, and we will make you the head of the court for Yisra’el.  He said to them, it is better for me to be called insane all my days and not for one hour wicked in the before Hashem, such that they will not say, for the position he returned (from his beliefs).  He would make leftover hair (hair on a metzora which stayed over from one affliction, which after clearing was replaced by another bright spot) tame (allow it to be considered, making the person a metzora again) and (make tame) yellowish blood (if a woman has an emission of yellowish blood, he would declare it a menstrual flow and her a nidda), and the Chachamim would make it (declare it) tahor.  He would allow the hair of a blemished bechor (firstborn animal, which was given to a kohen, and the hair of which could not be taken from the animal when it was alive) that he (the kohen) left in a window (if the hair fell out, a kohen might place it in a window to save) and after he slaughtered it (use the hair, and this was acceptable according to Akavia ben Mahalalel), and the Chachamim would prohibit.  He would say, one does not give to drink (the waters of a sota) a convert or a freed maidservant, and Chachamim said, they would give to drink.  They said to him, there was a case of Karkemit (who was) a freed maidservant who was in Yerushalayim, and Shmaya and Avtalyon gave her to drink.  He said to them, they gave her to drink as an example (to show the high level of converts, for they were also converts).  And the excommunicated him, and he died in excommunication, and the court stoned his coffin.  Rabi Yehuda said, God forbid that Akavia was excommunicated, for the courtyard (of the Beit Hamikdash) was not locked (which occurred when everyone came in for the festival) before any man from Yisra’el with the wisdom and fear of sin like Akavia ben Mehalalel (meaning none paralleled him in these traits).  And who did they excommunicate?  Eliezer ben Chanoch, for he questioned making the hands tahor (the ruling of the Chachamim that certain things make the hands tame but not the rest of the body).  And when he died, the court sent and rested a rock on his coffin, which teaches that all who are excommunicated and die in excommunication they stone his coffin.", 
        "When he (Akavia ben Mehalalel) died, he said to his son, my son, return for you in the four things I used to say.  He (the son) said to him, why didn’t you return for yourself?  He said (back) to him, I heard from the mouth of the many, and they heard from the mouth of the many, I stood on what I heard, and they stood on what they heard.  But you heard from the mouth of one and from the mouth of the many, it is better to leave the words of one and grasp the words of the many.  He said to him, father, commend me to your friends (make them draw me in) and he said, I will not commend.  He (the son) said to him, did you find fault in me?  He said to him, not, your actions will draw you close or your actions will distance you."
