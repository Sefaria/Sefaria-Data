        "Squares of crop between olive trees, Beit Shamay says you give pe’ah on each, and Beit Hillel says you give one pe’ah for all.  Beit Shamay Admits that if the head of the row is connected, you give one pe’ah for all.", 
        "If one harvests his field in separate patches, Rabi Akiva says you give pe’ah on each one.  Chachamim say one for all.  Dill and mustard, if you harvest separately, which is normal, the Chachamim admit you give a pe’ah on each one.", 
        "If one takes fresh onions to the shuk and stores dry ones for winter, you take separate pe’ot, and so too with peas and grapes.  One who thins a garden that is too dense gives pe’ah on what he left in the garden.  A person who plucks by had to take gives pe’ah on everything.", 
        "Onion seeds need pe’ah, but Rabi Yossi disagrees.  Squares in between onions, Rabi Yossi says a pe’ah on each, and Chachamim say one on all.", 
        "Brothers who split a field take separate pe’ot.  If they work together, they leave one.  Same with dividing a tree.  One who buys only trees to transplant to his field gives pe’ah on each tree’s existing fruit separately.  Rabi Yehuda asks, when do you just give one pe’ah?  When the owner sold all the trees he had.", 
        "Rabi Eliezer says, a rova of land is chayav pe’ah.  Rabi Yehoshua says two se’ah.  Rabi Tarfon says, 6 by 6 tfachim.  Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira says enough to harvest by fist twice, and the halacha is like him.  Rabi Akiva says any and is chayav and in bikurim, needing a prozbul, and to acquire things with money, a bill of sale, or an act of ownership.", 
        "The will of someone on their deathbed, if he included any land, it’s a valid gift.  If not, it isn’t.  If his wife accepts any possible land instead of a ktuba, she loses her ktuba.", 
        "If the above person gave his slave property, the slave is free.  But if he gave land, he’s not free.  Rabi Shimon says he’s always free, unless he writes that the slave gets all of this property except for one ten thousandth (which refers to his freedom)."
