        "One who marries a woman and she stipulated with him that he would maintain her daughter for five years, he is chayav to maintain her for five years.  If she married another, and she stipulated with him that he would maintain her daughter for five years, his is chayav to maintain her for five years, and the first may not say, when she comes to me I will maintain her, rather he sands her her maintenance to the place that her mother is.  And so too both of them may not say, behold, we will maintain her like one (together, splitting the costs), rather one maintains her and one gives her money of maintenance.", 
        "If she married, the husband gives her maintenance and the give her the money of maintenance.  If they (the mother’s husbands) died, the daughters are maintained from the free property (not anything which was sold but the husbands) and she (the mother) is maintained (even) from mortgaged property, because she is like a creditor.  The prudent ones would write (to the woman), on condition that I will maintain your daughter for five years as long as you are with me.", 
        "A widow who said, I do not want to move from the house of my husband (and forgo his property), the heirs may not say to herm go to your father’s house and we will maintain you, rather they maintain her in her husband’s house and they give her a place to live according to her honor (the respect due to her).  If she says, I don’t want to move from my father’s house, the heirs may say to her, if you ware by us, you have maintenance, but if you are not by us, you don’t have maintenance.  If she claimed (she wanted to be in her father’s house) because she is young and they are young (they are not her children, and are of similar age, so it might tarnish her reputation to live with them), they maintain her while she is in her father’s house.", 
        "The whole time she is in her father’s house, she may collect her ktuba for up to twenty-five years, for in twenty-five years she will do favors (give gifts financed by the heirs) corresponding to (the worth of) her ktuba, according to Rabi Meir who said it in the name of Raban Shimon ben Gamliel.  And the Chachamim say, as long as she is in her husband’s house, she may forever collect her ktuba, as long as she is in her father’s house, she may collect her ktuba for twenty-five years.  If she died, her heirs may call in her ktuba for twenty-five years."
