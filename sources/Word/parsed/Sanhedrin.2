        "A kohen gadol can judge and be judged, can testify and others can testify about them, he can do chalitza, and people can do yibum or chalitza for him, but he can’t do yibum, because he can’t marry an almana.  If someone close to him dies, he may not follow the corpse, either him or the pall bearers can be on a given street at the same time.  Rabi Meir says he goes out with them to the city entrance.  Rabi Yehuda says he doesn’t leave the Beit Hamikdash, saying the pasuk with ‘mikodesh’ is referring to the mikdash.  And when he consoles others, the people line up as they normally do, he walks to their right, and the second to kohen gadol walks on his right.  When others console him, they say, we are your atonement, and he says back, may you be blessed from shamayim.  When they prepare a funeral meal for him, everyone else sits on the ground, and he sits on a bench.", 
        "The king doesn’t judge and isn’t judged, doesn’t testify and isn’t testified about, doesn’t do chalitza and his wife doesn’t get chalitza, and doesn’t do yibum and his wife doesn’t get yibum.  Rabi Yehuda says if he wants to do chalitza or yibum, we look favorably upon it.  They said to him, we don’t listen to him if he wants to.  And nobody may marry his widow.  Rabi Yehuda says a king may marry a king’s widow, as we see a pasuk that says David marries Shaul’s widow.", 
        "If someone (of the king’s) died, he doesn’t leave the doorway of his palace.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he wants to go out after the corpse, he may, as we see David went out after Avner’s corpse, as we see from a pasuk.  They said to him, it was only to appease the nation.  When they prepare the funeral meal for him, everyone sits on the ground and he sits on a small couch.", 
        "You can only go to an optional war with the approval of a beit din of seventy-one.  And the king may break through others’ fences to make his road, and they don’t stop him, since the king’s road has no shiur.  And all booty is laid before him, and he takes a portion first.  He can only have eighteen wives.  Rabi Yehuda says, he can have more as long as they don’t cause him to do averot.  Rabi Shimon says, even one wife is prohibited if she will make him do averot.  So why do we have a limit from the pasuk?  Because even if they are like Avigayil, all good, he can’t take more than eighteen.  And he may not have too many horses, only enough for his chariot.  And he can’t have too much gold, only enough that he’ll keep up the country.  And he should have a torah written in his name (or by him), and when he goes to war he takes it with him, if he sits in judgment he has it with him, and if he sits to eat he has it with him, as we see in a pasuk.", 
        "One may not ride on the king’s horse, sit on his seat, use his scepter, or see him while he’s getting a haircut, naked, or bathing, so we will have fear like the pasuk says to."
