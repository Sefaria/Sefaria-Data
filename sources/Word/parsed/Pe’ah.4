        "Pe’ah is left attached to the ground.  For things off the ground, the owner gets it down and distributes it.  Rabi Shimon says, also with walnuts.  But if anyone thinks you should leave something connected you do, he speaks according to halacha.", 
        "But for suspended things, if anyone says to distribute you do.", 
        "He took a bit of pe’ah and threw it on the pe’ah still attached to the ground, it isn’t his.  If he fell on it or spread a talit on it, we take it back from him.  And this also applies to leket and shichicha.", 
        "Pe’ah can’t be taken with a scythe or spade, so that people won’t injure others.", 
        "There are three times when the owners let the poor in to take pe’ah, shachar, chatzot, and mincha.  Raban Gamliel said they gave times as a minimum.  Rabi Akiva said as a maximum.  In beit namer they would harvest in rows, and give from pe’ah from each row.", 
        "A non-Jew who harvested and then converted is patur from the gifts to the poor.  Rabi Yehuda says he’s chayav in shichicha, because that’s only in the time of bundling.", 
        "If he made it hekdesh and redeemed it while still attached to the ground, he’s chayav.  If this happened with bundles, he’s chayav.  If he made it hekdesh while grounded and redeemed while a bundle, he’s patur, because when it would have been chayav, it was patur.", 
        "Similarly with fruits that he does before the time of ma’asrot, he’s chayav.  If it was during the time of ma’asrot, he’s chayav.  But if he made it hekdesh before it ripened and then redeemed after it ripened, he’s patur because in the time it would have been chayav, it was patur.", 
        "One who harvested pe’ah and designated it for a certain poor person, Rabi Eliezer says it’s for that person.  Chachamim say he has to give it to the first person to come.  The gifts from a non-Jew are chayav in ma’asrot, unless the person got them because the non-Jew made them hefker.", 
        "What is leket? Something that falls when he’s harvesting.  One was harvesting, he cut and handful, picked a fistful, he got pricked by a thorn, and it fell from his hand, that belongs to the field’s owner.  If something falls from inside the hand, it’s for the poor.  If it’s behind the hand, i.e. outside the worker’s grasp, is for the owner.  If it’s in his fingertips, Rabi Yishma’el says for the poor, and Rabi Akiva says for the owner.", 
        "Yud Ant holes (where the ants have gathered grain) in the standing grain belong to the owner.  Ones the harvesters have overlooked, the upper ones are for the poor, and the lower ones are for the owner.   Rabi Meir says that they are all for the poor, because it might be leket, so it’s considered leket."
