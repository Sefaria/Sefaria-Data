        "this order of fasts which was said, it is talking about the first rain.  But for plants which (were) changed (in their appearance, i.e. grew deformed on the whole), they blew for them immediately.  And so too if rains stopped (defined as a period where) between one rain to another was forty days, the blow for it immediately, since it is a plague of drought.", 
        "If (enough rain) fell for plants, but not (enough) fell for a tree, (enough for) a tree but not (a good amount to be helpful) for plants, or (they are good) for both but not for cisterns, pits, or caves (used to collect water for drinking), they blow for them immediately.", 
        "And so too a city which rain did not fall upon, as it is written, “and I will cause rain (to fall) on one city, and on one city I will not cause to rain, one piece will be rained on etc.”  That city fasts and blows, and all its surroundings fast and do not blow.  Rabi Akiva says, they blow and do not fast.", 
        "And so too a city which had plague or collapsing (buildings), that city fasts and blows, and all of its surroundings fast and do not blow.  Rabi Akiva says, they blow and do not fast.  What is plague?  A city which has five hundred feet (men), and out of it three died in three days, one after another, this is plague.  Less than this, it isn’t plague.", 
        "For these they blow in all places, on heat scorched (or wind-dried) crops, crop yellowing, locusts, chasil (another type of locust), wild animals, and sword (war).  They blow for them, for is a moving (spreading) plague.", 
        "Once the elders went down from Yerushalayim to their cities, and they decreed a fast for there were heat scorched crops enough to fill the mouth of an oven in Ashkalon.  Furthermore, they decreed a fast because two babies were eaten by wolves in Transjordan.  Rabi Yossi says, not because they ate, but rather because they were seen.", 
        "For these they blow on Shabbat, for a city which goyim or a river encircled it, and for a ship being torn apart at sea.  Rabi Yossi says, for help and not for screaming.  Shimon the Timni says, even on the plague, and the Chachamim did not agree with him.", 
        "On any distress so that it will not come on the public they blow for it, except for too much rain.  Once they said to Choni Hama’agel (a person who was successful in praying for rain), pray that rain will fall.  He said to them, go and bring in (to your homes) the ovens for the pesach such that they do not get too soft.  He prayed, and rain didn’t fall.  What did he do?  He drew a circle and stood in it, and said before Him, Hashem, your children put their faces towards me, for I am like a member of the household for you.  I swear in your great name that I will not move from here until you have mercy on your children.”  The rains started to drizzle.  He said, I didn’t ask like that, rather rains for cisterns, pits, and caves.  They started to fall in a storm.  He said, I didn’t ask like that, rather rains of want, blessing, and devotion.  They fell like they should, until Yisra’el went out from Yerushalayim to the Temple mount because of the rains.  They came and said to him, just as you prayed they should fall, pray that they should go away.  He said to them, go out and see if the to’anim stone has been washed away (and only if it really destroying everything will I stop it).”  Shimon ben Shetach sent to him, were you not Choni, I would excommunicate you, but what can I do to you, for you indulge before Hashem and he does for you like your will like a sun who indulges before his father and he does his will.  And on you the pasuk says, “your mother and father will be happy and your children will rejoice.", 
        "If they were fasting and rain fell for them before sunset, they do not complete, after sunset, they complete.  Rabi Eliezer says, before midday, they do not complete, after midday they complete.  Once they decreed a fast in Lod and rain fell for them before midday.  Rabi Tarfon said to them, go out and eat and drink and make a Yom Tov.  And they went out, ate, drank, made Yom Tov, and in the afternoon they read the great Hallel."
