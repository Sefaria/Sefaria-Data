        "A bed that is six tfachim by six tfachim can be planted with five seeds, one on each side and one in the middle.  If it has a border a tefach high you can plant thirteen, three on each side and one in the middle.  He may not plant turnip heads on the border, because it will fill it up.  Rabi Yehuda says you can even plant six in the middle.", 
        "Seeds (normally only sown in large amounts) can’t be sown in a small patch, but vegetables can.  Mustard and smooth peas are considered seeds, and large peas are considered vegetables.  A border that was more than a tefach but got shortened is kosher, because it was originally kosher.  In a furrow or water channel a tefach deep you can sow three seeds, one on either side and one in it.", 
        "The head of a line of vegetables entered into a field of different vegetables, it’s allowed, because it looks like the end of his fields.  If his field was planted with vegetables, and he wants to plant a row of some other vegetable, Rabi Yishma’el says only if the furrow is completely open.  Rabi Akiva says it needs to be six tfachim long and its full width.  Rabi Yehuda says its width has to be the width of the sole of a foot.", 
        "One who plants two rows of squash, two rows of gourds, and two rows of Egyptian beans is allowed.  One row of each is asur.  One of each with another squash at the end, Rabi Eliezer allows, but the Chachamim don’t.", 
        "One plants squash and gourd in one hollow provided one leans one way and the other leans the other way, or the tips of one lean one way and those of the other the other way, because all kilayim derabanan is just because of marit ayin.", 
        "His fields was sown with onions, and he wishes to plant rows of gourds, Rabi Yishma’el says he pulls up two rows and plants one row, leaves two rows of onions the same, and then uproots two more rows and plants on of gourds.  Rabi Akiva says, he uproots two rows and plants two, leaves two rows, and then uproots two and plants two.  Chachamim say, if the gourds are closer than twelve amot from each other, you can’t have onions in between.", 
        "When a single gourd is planted among vegetables, it is treated as another vegetable (and separated by six tfachim).  When it is in grain, it gets a beit rova.  If his field was planted with grain and he wanted to plant a row of gourds, you only need six tfachim.  If it grew, he must cut it back to size.  Rabi Yossi says, you give it four amot to work it.  They said to him, are you stricter with this than with grapes?  He said to them, it is stricter, because a single grape vine gets six tfachim and a single gourd gets a beit rova.  Rabi Meir says in the name of Rabi Yishma’el, wherever three gourds make up a beit se’ah, the beit se’ah can’t have any other seed.  Rabi Yossi ben Hachotef Efrati said in the name of Rabi Yishma’el, whenever there are three gourds in a beit kor, the beit kor can’t have any other seed."
