        "One who sells a ship, he sold the mast the sail, the anchor, and the (things which) steer it, but not the slaves, not the sacks, and not the cargo.  But when he (the seller) said to him, it (the ship) and all which is in it, behold they are all sold.  If he sold a wagon, he did not sell the mules; if he sold the mules, he did not sell the wagon.  If he sold a yoke, he did not sell the cattle; if he sold the cattle, he did not sell the yoke.  Rabi Yehuda says, the money informs.  How?  He said to him, sell me your yoke fore two hundred zuz, the thing is known that a yoke is not (sold) for two hundred zuz (and animals are included).  But the Chachamim say, the money is not a proof.", 
        "One who sells a donkey, he did not sell its vessels (saddle etc.).  Nachum Hamadi says, he sold its vessels.  Rabi Yehuda says, sometimes they sell and sometimes they don’t sell.  How?  If the donkey was before him and its vessels were on it, and he (the buyer) said to him, sell me this donkey of yours, behold its vessels are sold.  (If one asked,) is that donkey yours (and asked to buy it), the vessels are not sold.", 
        "One who sells a donkey sold the foal (which it gave birth to).  If he sold a cow, he sis not sell its child.  If he sold a dung heap, he sold the manure in it.  If he sold a hole, he sold its water.  If he sold a beehive, he sold its bees.  If he sold a dovecote he sold the doves.  One who buys the fruits of a dovecote (doves that will be born) from his friend makes the first pair fly away (lets the seller keep a pair of young to ensure that the doves will stay there).  (If one brought) the fruits of a beehive, he takes (the first) three swarms and (then) alternates (so the hive will remain populated).  (If he buys) honeycombs, he leaves two honey comes (so the bees will stay).  Olive trees to cut down, he leaves two shoots (so the trees will renew).", 
        "One who acquires two trees in his friends’ field, behold this one did not acquire land.  Rabi Meir says, he acquired land.  If they grew, he may not trim.  And what comes up from the trunk is his, but from the roots is of the landowner’s.  And if they died, he does not have land.  If he acquires three trees, he acquired land.  If they grew, he may trim them, and what comes up from the trunk or from the roots is his.  And if they died, he has land.", 
        "One who sells the head of a large animal (cattle) did not sell the legs (for the animal is large, so each part has separate value); if he sold the legs, he did not sell the head.  If he sold the windpipe, he did not sell the liver; if he sold the liver, he did not sell the windpipe.  But, with a thin (animal, meaning sheep), if he sold the head, he sold the legs, but if he sold the legs, he did not sell the head.  If he sold the windpipe, he sold the liver, but if he sold the liver, he did not sell the windpipe.  ", 
        "There are four measures (rules) by sellers.  If he sold him good wheat and they were found to be bad, the buyer can return on it (rescind).  (If he sold) bad (wheat) and they were found to be good, the seller can return on it.  If bad and they were found to be bad, good and they were found to be good, not (neither) one of them can return on it.  If (he intended to sell) dark wood and it was found to be white, white and it was found to be dark, olive wood and it was found to be of sycamore, of sycamore and it was found to be of olive, wine and it was found to be vinegar, or vinegar and it was found to be wine, both of them can return on them.", 
        "One who sells produce to his friend, if he pulled (the produce toward him) but did not measure it, he acquired it; measured but didn’t pull, he did not acquire.  If he (the buyer) was of sound senses (clever), he rents its place (the place of the grain he has not yet acquired so as to make it his.  One who buys flax from his friend, behold he did not acquire until he takes it from place to place, and if it was connected to the ground and he picked any at all, he acquired.", 
        "One who sells wine and oil to his friend and they became more expensive or cheaper, if it (the price change) is until before the amount was filled, (the upper hand is) for the seller, if from when the measure was filled, for the buyer.  And if there was a middleman between them (who takes care of the measuring) and the barrel broke, it broke for the middleman (he must replace it).  And he (the seller) is obligated to drop for him three drops (allowing more time for the price to change).  If he (the buyer) turned it over (on its side) and let it drip (the bit which got on the outside of the barrel), behold it (the dripping) is (property) of the seller.  But a storekeeper (as opposed to a private salesman) is not required to drop three drops.  Rabi Yehuda says, erev Shabbat, if it got dark, he is exempt (from adding three drops).", 
        "One who sends his son to a shopkeeper with a pundyon (two issars) in his hand (to tell the shopkeeper what he wants but not to deliver the goods), he (the seller) measured for him with an issar (worth of oil) and gave him an issar (change), if the jar broke or he lost the issar, the shopkeeper is chayav (for he should have sent it with an adult).  Rabi Yehuda exempts, for for this purpose (we assume) he sent him (his son, to collect the goods).  And the Chachamim admit to Rabi Yehuda that when the jar is in the hand of the child and the shopkeeper measured into it, the shopkeeper is patur (for he brought a jar).", 
        "A wholesaler wipes his measures once every thirty days, and a homeowner (cleans his measures) once every twelve months.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, it is a switch of the things (the opposite is the case).  A shopkeeper wipes his measures twice a week, polishes his weights once a week, and wipes his scale for every weighing.", 
        "Yud Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what is this talking about?  With moist (products).  But with dry (products) he does not need (to clean the scale).  One must overweigh for him (in the customer’s favor, up to) a tefach.  If he was weighing for him an eye in an eye (exactly), he gives him hi additions (adds to ensure he is not cheating), one in ten with moist, and one in twenty for dry.  A place where they had a custom to measure with a small (measurement) he may not measure with big, (if they have a custom to measure) with a big, he may not measure with small.  To smooth (the top of measures), he may not heap, to heap, he may not smooth (for the costumer may be unable to estimate them)."
