        "From when may one prepare manure in heaps (during shvi’it)?  When those who do work their fields on shvi’it (e.g. non-Jews) stop, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, from when the manure dries up.  Rabi Yossi says, from when the manure dries enough to form solid pallets.", 
        "How much manure can be deposited in the heaps?  Until three dung heaps per beit se’ah, each containing ten baskets of a letech (a unit of measurement making each heap 150 se’ah).  One may increase the number of baskets per heap, but not the number of heaps.  Rabi Shimon says, even the number of heaps.", 
        "One makes his field with three dung heaps in each se’ah.  If he makes more, he makes them into a triangle, according to Rabi Shimon.  Chachamim forbid making more piles unless they are three tfachim above or below the flat parts of the field.  One may make his dung heap one large pile.  Rabi Meir forbids this unless he raises or lowers it three tfachim.  If he had a small heap, he can add to it repetitively (not all his manure at one time).  Rabi Elazar ben Azariah forbids unless he lowers or raises three tfachim.", 
        "One who uses a field to let cows graze (and make manure), he must make the pen two beit se’ah.  He removes three sides and leaves the wall that stays between the old and new pen and makes a pen that makes a total of four beit se’ah.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, the pen can be eight beit se’ah.  If his whole field is four beit se’ah, he leaves part of it (unenclosed), because of marit ayin, and takes from the pen and puts in his field the way people normally spread manure.", 
        "One may not open a quarry for the first time (during shvi’it) in his field, until it has three layers, three amot by three amot by three amot high, their measure is twenty-seven stones.", 
        "A fence that has ten stones each able to support two people, these may be removed.  The measurement of a wall is ten tfachim.  If it’s less than that, he cuts it and can level it until it’s under a tefach.  What is this talking about?  When it’s his, but if it’s his friend’s, he can remove whatever he wants.  What is this talking about?  If he did not start from erev shvi’it, but if he did, he can remove whatever (of his wall) he wants.", 
        "Stones which the plow forced up, or which had been covered but were uncovered, if there are two which each can support two people, these he may remove.  One who clears stones from his field, he may take the upper stones, but not those which touch the ground.  So too with a heap of pebbles or a stack of stones, he may take the top but leaves those which touch the earth.  If there is rocky ground or straw underneath, he may take them.", 
        "One may not build steps by ravines erev shvi’it after the rains stop, because he is fixing things for shvi’it.  But on may build them during shvi’it after the rain has stopped, because he is fixing for motzei shvi’it.  But he may not cement the stones with earth, but he may make a loose pile.  Any stone he can take with his hand (while in his field) he may take.", 
        "Stones so heavy they must be carried on the shoulders may be taken from anywhere.  And a contractor may take (even smaller shoulder stones) from anywhere.  What exactly are shoulder stones?  Anything one cannot take with one hand, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, shoulder stones are like their name, they have to be taken two or three on the shoulder.", 
        "One who builds a fence between himself and the public domain may dig down to rock.  What does he do with the earth?  He heaps it up in the public domain and then fixes it (flat), according to Rabi Yehoshua.  Rabi Akiva says, Justas one may not damage the public domain, one may not fix in it.  So what does he do with the earth?  He piles it in his field like one who piles manure.  So too with one who digs a whole, a trench, or a cave."
