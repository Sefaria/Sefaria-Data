        "These are said in any language, the paragraph of sota (when the woman is being informed, it is done in a language she understands, not necessarily Hebrew), confession of ma’aser (a declaration made when one makes sure his house is free of ma’asrot), reading of shma, shmone esre, the blessing on food (said after the meal), the oath of testimony, and the oath of a deposit (that a guard did not misuse it).", 
        "And these are said (only) in the holy language (Hebrew), the reading for bikurim (which is said when the first fruits are brought to the Beit Hamikdash), chalitza (when a man denies his late brother’s wife levirate marriage), blessing and curses (which were recited from the torah by the levi’im), the blessing of the kohen gadol (on Yom Hakippurim), the paragraph of the king (read at hakhel), the paragraph of egla arufa (which the sages read when they kill a calf in repentance for an unknown corpse found), and the one (kohen) anointed for battle when he speaks to the nation (to encourage them).", 
        "The reading for the bikurim (first fruits), how (do we know it needs to be said in Hebrew)?  “And you shall answer and say before Hashem your God,” (referring to the blessings and curses) and there it says, “and the levi’im shall answer and say” (referring to the bikurim).  Just as the answering there is in Hebrew, so too here (it is said) in Hebrew. ", 
        "(The formula said when performing) chalitza how?  “And she shall answer and say,” (referring to chalitza) and there it says, “and the levi’im shall answer and say.”  Just as answering there is in Hebrew, so too here it is in Hebrew.  Rabi Yehuda says, “and she shall answer and say like this,” (the like this teaches us that it is only valid) when she says it in Hebrew.", 
        "Blessings and curses how?  Since the children of Israel crossed the Jordan (when coming into Eretz yisra’el with Yehoshua) and they came to Mount Grizim and Mount Eval which were in Shomron on the side of Shchem, which is next to Eloney More, as it says, “are they not across the Jordan etc.” and there it says, “and Avraham passed in the land, until the place of Shchem until the place of Elon More,” just as the Elon More said there is Shchem, so too the Elon More which is said here is Shchem.  Six tribes went up to the top of Mount Grizim and six tribes went up to the top of Mount Eval, and the kohanim and levi’im and the ark were standing down in the middle, the kohanim encircling the ark, and the levi’im (encircling) the kohanim, and all of yisra’el from here and there, as it says, “and all of yisra’el and its elders, its officers, and its judges are sanding on here and here (either side) of the ark etc.”  they turned to face Mount Grizim and opened with a blessing, blessed is the man who shall not make a statue and a molten image, and these and these (on both sides) say amen.  They turned to face Mount Eval and opened with a curse, “cursed is the man who shall make a statue or a molten image,” and these and these answer amen, until they finished the blessings and curses.  And afterwards they brought the stones and plastered it with plaster, and they wrote on it all the words of the torah in seventy languages, as it says, “well clarified,” and they took the stones and came and slept in their places (in Gilgal).", 
        "The blessing of the kohanim how?  In the country they say it as three blessings, and in the Beit Hamikdash one blessing.  In the Beit Hamikdash he says the name (of Hashem) as it is written, and in the country with a nickname.  In the country the kohanim raise their hands opposite their shoulders, and in the Beit Hamikdash on top of their heads, except for the kohen gadol who does not raise his hands above the tzitz (golden head plate of the kohen gadol).  Rabi Yehuda says, also the kohen gadol raises his hands above the tzitz, as it says, “and Aaron raised his hands to the nation and he blessed them.”", 
        "The blessings of the kohen gadol (on Yom Hakippurim), how?  The chazzan (cantor) of the synagogue takes the sefer torah and gives it to the had of the synagogue, and the head of the synagogue gives it to the sgan (deputy kohen gadol), and the sgan gives it to the kohen gadol, and the kohen gadol stands, accepts, and reads standing, and reads, “after the death,” and, “but on the tenth day.”  And he rolls the torah, rests it on his lap, and says, more than what I have read to you is written here.  “And on the tenth,” which is in Bamidbar, he reads by heart, and he blesses on it eight blessings, on the torah, on the service, on the thanksgiving, on the pardon for sin, on the Beit Hamikdash, on Yisra’el, on the kohanim, and on the rest of the prayers.", 
        "The paragraph of the king (read for hakhel), how?  Motzei the first Yom Tov of Sukkot, on the eighth (year) motzei shvi’it, they make him a wooden stage in the courtyard, and he sits on it, as it says, “after seven years on the festival etc.”  The chazzan of the synagogue takes the sefer torah and gives it to the had of the synagogue, and the head of the synagogue gives it to the sgan, and the sgan gives it to the kohen gadol, the kohen gadol gives it to the king, and the king stands, accepts it, reads, and sits.  Agripas the king stood, accepted, and read standing, and the Chachamim praised him.  And when they reached, “you cannot put upon yourself a foreign man,” (which Agripas was) his eyes filled with tears They said to him, do not be afraid, Agripas, you are our brother, you are our brother, you are our brother.  And he reads from the beginning of, “these are the things,” until, “shma,” and “shma,” “and it shall be if you listen (the second paragraph of shma),” “tithe shall you tithe,” “when you have finished tithing,” the paragraph of the king, and the blessings and the curses, until he finishes the paragraph.  The blessings which the kohen gadol blesses, the king blesses, except for that he puts that of festivals instead of forgiveness of sin."
