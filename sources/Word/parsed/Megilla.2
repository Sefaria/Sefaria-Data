        "One who reads the megilla out of order isn’t yotze.  If he read it by heart or read a translation in any language, he’s not yotze.  But one may read in foreign languages to those who speak (only) foreign languages.  And one who speaks foreign languages who heard in Hebrew is yotze.", 
        "If he read it with interruptions or while dozing he’s yotze.  If he was writing it, expounding it, or correcting it, if he had the proper intention, he’s yotze, and if not, he’s not yotze.  If he was writing it with a paint, red paint, gum based paint, or calcanthum and on paper or unfinished parchment, he isn’t yotze until it is written on Hebrew on parchment with ink.", 
        "A person of a city who went to a large city or a person of a large city who went to a city, if he will return to his place, he reads like his place, and if not, he reads with them.  From where does a person read the megilla to be yotze in it?  Rabi Meir says, all of it.  Rabi Yehuda says, from “there was a Jewish man.”  Rabi Yossi says, “after these things.”", 
        "All are valid to read the megilla except a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, and minor.  Rabi Yehuda validates a minor.  They do not read megilla, they do not circumcise, they do not immerse, and they do not sprinkle (the water of the red heifer to make tahor).  And so too a woman who keeps a day (of being tahor) opposite one day (of being tame) does not immerse until sunset.  And all who did (their obligation) from first light is kosher.", 
        "The whole day is valid for the reading of megilla, reading Hallel, blowing shofar, taking lulav, for musaf prayers and offerings, confession (of a kohen gadol) on a bull (if he sinned), the confession (declaration) of ma’aser (that all things have been properly removed from the house), confession of You Hakippurim, leaning on an offering, slaughtering, waving (the omer), bringing near, taking a handful (of ashes), burning (all three of the mincha offering), severing of the neck (of birds), reception of blood to sprinkle on the mizbe’ach), for sprinkling (blood on the mizbe’ach), for having a sota drink (water to see if she was and adulterer), for killing of the heifer (when a corpse is found between towns a cow is killed as a scapegoat), and for making a metzora tahor.", 
        "The whole night is valid for harvesting the omer and burning fats and limbs (of korbanot which must be burnt).  This is the general rule, a thing where the mitzva is in the day, it is valid the whole day, and a thing where the mitzva is in the nigh, it is valid the whole night."
