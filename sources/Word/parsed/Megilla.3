        "If the people of a city sold their open area (where they would pray), they buy with the money a shul.  (If they sold) a shul, they buy an ark.  If an ark, they buy wrappings (for the torahs).  Wrappings, they buy books (of tanach).  Books, they buy a torah.  But if they sold a torah they may not buy books, (if they sold) books they may not buy wrappings, wrappings they may not buy an ark, an ark, they may not buy a shul, a shul, they may not buy an open space, and so too with their surpluses (they have from selling).  They do not sell something of many for an individual, since they are reducing it in its holiness, according to Rabi Yehuda.  They said to him, if so, even not (selling holy things) from a large town to a small town.", 
        "One may not sell a shul except for on condition that if they want, they will return it, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, they may sell it permanently except for (not to be used for the following) four things, a bathhouse, a tannery, immersion, and a place of water (either a urinal or laundry).  Rabi Yehuda says, they may sell it for a courtyard and the purchaser can do whatever he wants with it.", 
        "And furthermore said Rabi Yehuda, a shul which was destroyed, one may not eulogize in it, twist rope in it (as a factory), spread nets in it (as traps for animals), spread produce (to dry) on its roof, or use it as a cut-through, as it says, “and I will destroy your temples,” their holiness is even when they are barren.  If grass grew on it, one may not pluck because of the grief (so people will grieve for the shul).", 
        "Rosh Chodesh of Adar which fell out on Shabbat, they read the parsha of shkalim (because the announcement for the shkalim was made).  If it fell within the week, they advance it to the past Shabbat (the one before) and they pause on the next Shabbat.  On the second, (after, they read) “zachor,” the third, “the red heifer,” the fourth, “this month will be for you,” (and) the fifth they return to the order.  They interrupt (the normal haftora) for all (of the following), on Rosh Chodesh, Chanuka, Purim, fasts, ma’amadot, and on Yom Hakippurim.", 
        "On Pesach, they read from the parsha of the festivals in vayikra.  On Shavuot, “seven weeks.”  On Rosh Hashana, “in the seventh month on the first of the month.”  On Yom Hakippurim, “after the death.”  On the first of Yom Tov of Sukkot they read from the parsha of festivals in vayikra.  And on all the rest of the days of Sukkot, the offerings of Sukkot.", 
        "On Chanuka, from the princes (who brought gifts to dedicate the mishkan).  On Purim, “and Amalek came.”  On Rosh Chodesh, “and on your Rosh Chodesh.”  The ma’amadot, the works of creation.  On fasts, blessings and curses.  They do not stop in the curses, rather one reads them all.  On Monday, Thursday, and mincha on Shabbat, they read in the order and they are not taken into account (so as to change the parsha the following week), as it says, “and Moshe told the festivals of Hashem to Bnei Yisra’el,” their mitzva is that each one will be read in its time."
