        "(A kohen who is) a tvul yom (one who immersed that day but has not yet become tahor) and one (a kohen) who lacks atonement (lacks sacrifices as the final step of becoming tahor) do not take a share in the holy (meats) to eat at night.  A griever (one with an unburied dead relative) may touch (korbanot) but does not offer and does not take a share to eat at night.  Those who have blemishes, whether permanent blemishes or temporary blemishes, they take a share and eat, but they do not offer.  Whoever is not fit for service does not take a share of the meat, and whoever has no share in the meat has no share in the hides.  Even is he was tame during the time of sprinkling the blood and he was tahor in the time of the burning of the fats, he does not take a share in the meat, as it says, “the one who offers the blood of the shlamim and the fat, of the children of Aharon, for him will the right shoulder will be a portion.”", 
        "Whatever the mizbe’ach did not merit in its meat (if it was not offered on the mizbe’ach), the kohanim did not merit in its hide, as it says, “the olah of a person,” and olah that went up (was offered) for a person.  An olah that was slaughtered not for its sake, even though it didn’t count for its owners, the hide is for the kohanim.  Whether the olah or a man or the olah of a woman, its hide is for the kohanim.", 
        "The hides of light holies are for the owners, and the hides of the holies of holies are for the kohanim.  (We could learn out from a) kal vechomer!  Just as with an olah, where they (the kohanim) did not merit in (having) the meat they merited in the hides, so too in the holies of holies where they merited in the meat, isn’t it logical that they should merit in the hides?  The mizbe’ach is no proof (one might think that just as in an olah the mizbe’ach merits in the meat but no hide, so too the kohanim with holies of holies could merit in meat but no hides) for the mizbe’ach doesn’t get hides from anyplace.", 
        "Any holy (korbanot) which became invalid before their flaying, their hides are not for the kohanim.  If it was after their flaying, their hides are for the kohanim.  Rabi Chanina sgan (vice) of the kohanim said, in all my days I never sat a hide going out to the place of burning,  Rabi Akiva said, from his words we learned that one who flays a bechor and it is found to be a trefah, that the hide is given to the kohanim.  The Chachamim say, there is no, ‘I didn’t see’ as a proof (it is not a valid proof), rather, it goes out to be burned.", 
        "The bulls which are burnt and rams which are burn, when they are burnt according to their procedure, they are burnt in the place of the ashes, and they cause clothes to be tame.  But if they are not burnt according to their procedure, they are burnt in the Beit Habirah (an ash heap in the Beit Hamikdash) and they do not make clothes tame.", 
        "They were carried on poles (to the place where they would be burnt).  If the first (carriers) went outside the wall of the courtyard and the last ones had not yet left, the first ones’ clothing was tame but the last ones’ clothing was not tame until they exited.  If they both left, the clothing of both of them became tame.  Rabi Shimon says, neither’s clothing becomes tame until the fire lights most of it.  If the flesh has burned, the clothes of the one who burned are not tame."
