        "One who says to his friend, I am selling you the space of a kor of dirt, if there were clefts ten tfachim deep or rocks ten tfachim high, they are not measured with it (as part of the area).  Less than this, they are measured with it.  And if he (the seller) said to him, about the space of a kor of dirt, even if the clefts were more than ten tfachim deep or the rocks were more than ten tfachim high, behold these are measured with it.", 
        "(If one says,) I am selling you the space of a kor of dirt measured with a rope (exactly), if he (gave) less at all, he will reduce (the fee), and if he added at all, he (the buyer) will give back (the land).  If he (the seller) said, whether less or more, even if he diminished (the measure) by a rova per se’ah or added a rova per se’ah they came to him (the sale stands) more than this, they make an accounting (to rectify the area problem).  What does he (the buyer) return to him (if he got too much)?  Money, and if he wants he returns to him land.  So why did they say, he returns to him money?  To increase the power of the seller, for if he left in the field the space of nine kabin, or in a garden the space of half a kav, and according to Rabi Akiva the space of a rova, he (the buyer) returns him the land, and not only the rova does he return, rather he returns all of the extra (the seller can get some land back this way).", 
        "(If the seller said) measuring with a rope, whether less or more, (saying,) whether less or more, nullified (his statement of), measuring with a rope.  (If he said,) whether less or more, measuring with a rope, measuring with a rope mollified, whether less or more, according to Ben Nanas.  (If he sells the area) with (certain) marks and boundaries (to describe the area), (if it was off) by less than a sixth, it came to him (the sale stands), to the point of a sixth, he will deduct (from the payment).", 
        "One who says to his friend, I am selling you half (of a particular) field, we assess between them and he (the seller) takes half of (the value of) his field (so if he takes better parts, he gets less area).  (If he says,) I am selling you the half in the south, they assess between them and he takes the half in the south.  And he (the buyer) accepts upon himself (forfeiting) the space of the fence, the furrow, and the small furrow (for the fence).  And how much is the furrow?  Six tfachim.  A small furrow?  Three."
