        "One should to his friend, take this produce up to Yerushalayim for a share (of the produce).  Rather he should say to him, take them up so that we may eat and drink them in Yerushalayim.  But they may give one another a present, for free.", 
        "One may not buy truma with ma’aser sheni money, since this reduces the number of (possible) consumers, and Rabi Shimon allows.  Rabi Shimon said to them, just as if they ruled leniently (may be bought) by shlamim offerings, which are limited by pigul (if one intends to eat after the time limit), notar (if the time limit for eating has passed), and tuma (where it is forbidden to eat), shouldn’t we be lenient by truma?  They said to him, is it just so if we were lenient by shlamim, which is allowed to zarim, should we be lenient by truma, which is assur for a zar?", 
        "One who had money in Yerushalayim and needs it (for non-allowed things), and his friend has produce, he may said to his friend, this money is redeemed on your produce.  This one eats the produce while tahor, and that one uses the money for whatever.  But he may not say this to an am ha’aretz except on dmai.", 
        "Produce in Yerushalayim and money in the country, one says, that money is redeemed on this fruit.  Money in Yerushalayim and produce in the country, one says, this money is redeemed on that fruit, as long as he takes the produce up to Yerushalayim to eat.", 
        "Money may enter and leave Yerushalayim, but produce enters but doesn’t leave.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, even produce may enter and leave.", 
        "Produce which has had all work completed and was passed through Yerushalayim its ma’aser sheni must be brought back and eaten in Yerushalayim.  If the work hasn’t been completed, (as in) baskets of grapes for the winepress or baskets of figs to be dried, Beit Shamay says, he must return their ma’aser sheni to Yerushalayim, and Beit Hillel says he should redeem and eat it anywhere.  Rabi Shimon ben Yehuda says in the name of Rabi Yossi, Beit Shamay and Beit Hillel didn’t disagree about fruits which weren’t completed, for you redeem them and eat them anywhere.  What did they disagree about?  One completed fruits , for Beit Shamay says, he must return their ma’aser sheni to Yerushalayim, and Beit Hillel says he should redeem and eat it anywhere.  And dmai enters, leaves, and may be redeemed.", 
        "A tree which stand inside (Yerushalayim) but leans outside, or stands outside and leans inside, what faces the wall’s inside is as if inside, and what faces the wall’s outside is like outside.  Oil presses whose openings are inside but their interiors are outside or whose opening are outside and their interiors are inside, Beit Shamay says, they are all as if inside, and Beit Hillel says, facing the wall inward is like inside, and facing the wall outward is like outside.", 
        "Chambers build in the holy (Beit Hamikdash courtyard) with their entrances in the non-holy (towards the temple mount), their insides are non-holy and their roofs are holy.  If they are built in the holy and non-holy and their entrances are in holy and non-holy, their insides and roofs that are facing the holy are holy, and those facing the non-holy are non-holy.", 
        "Ma’aser sheni that entered Yerushalayim and became tame, whether it became tame from the source of tuma on a contaminated object, whether inside or outside of Yerushalayim, Beit Shamay says, he should redeem it and eat it in Yerushalayim, except (the value of) the portion which was contaminated from the source of tuma outside of Yerushalayim.  Beit Hillel says, he should redeem it and eat it outside of Yerushalayim, except for what was contaminated by a contaminated object outside Yerushalayim.", 
        "Something bought using ma’aser sheni money which became tame, must be redeemed.  Rabi Yehuda says, it must be buried.  They said to Rabi Yehuda, just as ma’aser sheni itself, if it becomes tame may be redeemed, something bought with ma’aser sheni money which became tame, shouldn’t it be redeemed?  He said to them, no, if you say about ma’aser sheni itself, which when tahor may be redeemed far from Yerushalayim, would you say so by something bought with ma’aser sheni money, which when tahor cannot be redeemed far from Yerushalayim?", 
        "Yud A deer which was bought with ma’aser sheni money and died, it must be buried with its hide.  Rabi Shimon says, it may be redeemed.  If he bought it live and slaughtered it, and it became tame, he may redeem.  Rabi Yossi says, it must be buried.  If one bought it slaughtered and it became tame, it is like produce.", 
        "Yud One who lends jars for ma’aser sheni, even though he (the borrower) sealed them, they (the jars) do not get the status of ma’aser sheni.  If he poured into them without declaring, before he seals they don’t become ma’aser, but after he seals they do become ma’aser.  Until he seals it (the jug) can be nullified by one in a hundred (referring to truma), but after he seals it, it makes holy in any amount.  Until he seals it, he may take truma from one on all of them.  Afterwards, he takes from each jug.", 
        "Yud Beit Shamay says, (if one wants to buy wine with ma’aser sheni money but doesn’t want the jar to become ma’aser sheni) the seller must open the jar and spill into a winepress.  Beit Hillel says, he must open, but there’s no need to spill.  What is this talking about?  A place where they normally sell sealed jars, but in a place where they normally sell open jars, the jar cannot be chulin.  But if one wants to take a stringency upon himself and sell the wine by measure (and not price by jar) the jar will always be chulin.  Rabi Shimon says, even one who says to his friend, I am selling you this barrel, except for the jar, the jar is chulin."
