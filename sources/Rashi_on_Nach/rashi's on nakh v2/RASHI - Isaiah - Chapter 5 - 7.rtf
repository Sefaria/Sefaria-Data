\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ O House of Israel, for all that He did for this vineyard, He did for Israel. The vineyard represents 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Adam, for we find in Midrash Aggadah, in many places in Tanhuma, and in Genesis Rabbah [that] 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ these passages are expounded concerning him, e.g., Adam was not expelled from Paradise until he 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ reviled and blasphemed, as it is said: And He hoped to produce grapes,... (Gen. Rabbah 19:12). And in 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ another place we find: He appointed guards over him that he should not eat from the Tree of Life, as it 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ is said (verse 6): ìAnd I will command the clouds...î (ibid. 21:8). And in this manner, [the following 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ verses] can be expounded concerning him: \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ (1) My beloved had a vineyard. A vineyard\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  This [alludes 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ to] Adam. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ My beloved\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  This is the Holy One, blessed be He. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ In a fertile corner\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  in the Garden of 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Eden. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ (2) And he fenced it in\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  with the ten canopies mentioned in Ezekiel (28), in the section dealing 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ with Hiram, king of Tyre. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And He cleared it of stones\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Of temptation, until he ate from the tree, and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ temptation gained entry into him. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And He planted it with the choicest vines\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  The beginning of his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ formation was from the place of the altar. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And He built a tower in its midst\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  And He breathed into his 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ nostrils the spirit of life, from the heavenly beings. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And also a vat He hewed therein\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  A spring 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ flowing, the fountain of wisdom. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And He hoped to produce grapes\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  that he would thank Him and 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ praise Him. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And it produced wild berries\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  putrid things; he reviled and blasphemed. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ (3) Judge now 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ Since the end of the parable comes to say that they too did like him, he asks them the judgment. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ (5) I

\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ made him dwell in desolation, for I did not give the Torah in his days. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ It shall neither be pruned nor

\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ up\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  Temptation ruled over him and his posterity, to perform corrupt deeds. \lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ And I commanded the

\lang1033\ltrch\f2\fs36\b\i0\ul0\cf2\cb10\ Lord of Hosts is the House of Israel\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  For the House of Israel is to Me like that vineyard; The ten 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ tribes were to Me like a vineyard producing wine, like an olive orchard, in a fat corner, in a fat land, 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ [producing anointing] oil for the priesthood, [anointing] oil for the kingdom, oil for the Menorah, oil 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ for the meal offerings. I fenced them in first with the encirclement of the clouds of glory in the desert 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ and I cleared them of stones, i.e., I cleansed them of the transgressors of the generation. I planted them 
\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ with the choicest vines \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ (˘“Â…¯≈˜)\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\  six hundred and six commandments, like the numerical value of \lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ ˘“Â…¯≈˜\lang1033\ltrch\f0\fs36\b0\i0\ul0\cf0\cb8\ , I
