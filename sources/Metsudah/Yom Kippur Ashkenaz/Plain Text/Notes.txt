@b1<EM><EN><*4>4@b2<EN>Anyone who has transgressed either a law of the Torah or Rabbinic law is called an “Avaryan” (transgressor) and is subject to excommunication from the community and hence cannot be included in any prayer or service which requires a quorum. (See Periesha to Tur Shulchan Aruch section 619, also Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 324). Special permission is thus required in order to include them in our prayers. The above declaration is based on a talmudic statement: “Rabbi Shimon Chasidah says: A public fast wherein Jewish transgressors do not participate is not a [true] fast.” This is deduced from the fact that though the odor of galbanum is unpleasant, Scripture included it among the fragrant spices of the incense-offering.—Maseches Kerisos 6b
@sn<EM><EN>According to Bach (Ibid.) permission granted is not a blanket dispensation but is predicated on the assumption that these transgressors will repent. This is implied in the words: @hh<HEB>עַל דַעַת הַמָקוֹם@ee<ENG>, with the consent of Hashem.

@b1<EM><EN><*9>9@b2<EN>This means that the entire prototypical expression as given in note 5 is not used.

@b1<EM><EN><*35>35@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@ee<ENG>, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ@ee<ENG> and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@ee<ENG> recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.
@b1<EM><EN><*36>36@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>תֵּן@hh@ee<ENG> implies @hh<HEB>מַתָּנָה@hh@ee<ENG>, a gift. We ask Hashem to grant us the feeling of reverence for Him, as a gift, knowing how difficult it is to attain such a high level of reverence completely on our own (Siach Yitzchok).
@b1<EM><EN><*37>37@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>מַעֲשֶׂיךָ@hh@ee<ENG>, lit., Your works, indicates that which has attained or is near perfection. Thus Yisrael is called His works since we have accepted His Kingship and His Torah which is the fulfillment of Hashem’s creation (Siach Yitzchok).
@b1<EM><EN><*38>38@b2<EN>All you have created, @hh<HEB>שֶׁבָּרָאתָ@hh@ee<ENG>, indicates that which has not attained its fulfillment, thus we ask Hashem to cast His dread even on those people who have not yet accepted His Divine Kingdom (Siach Yitzchok).
@b1<EM><EN><*39>39@b2<EN>The nation of Yisrael will fear You.
@b1<EM><EN><*40>40@b2<EN>The nations of the world will finally prostrate themselves before You, i.e. submit to You and accept the yoke of Your Kingship.
@b1<EM><EN><*41>41@b2<EN>Once all of Your works and created beings have submitted themselves to Your rule and formed a single bond to do Your will, the honor of Yisrael will be established and raised to new heights.

@b1<EM><EN><*42>42@b2<EN>Those who fear Hashem will then be praiseworthy in the eyes of all men.

@b1<EM><EN><*45>45@b2<EN>See Tehillim 132:17. The climax of this spiritual renaissance will be the restoration of our people to our land under the scepter of the Moshiach, descendant of Dovid, the anointed of Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*46>46@b2<EN>The entire universe was created for the sake of Yisrael in order that Hashem’s Divine Influence be attached to it. This essence (Yisrael) was created for the sake of an even more treasured essence, namely the prophets and the pious among them. This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashanah±Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).

@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>Were it not for the intervention of the wondrous power of Hashem’s grace, our moral and physical entity would have long ceased, as a consequence of our transgressions. This would have been our fate in accordance with the law of cause and effect which functions in Hashem’s world according to His will. It is only Hashem Himself, He Who originally ordained that law, Who in the omnipotence of His will, can also suspend that law. Only He can cause the wrong which was done to become as if it had never occurred. Only Hashem can uproot in its entirety the sin and consequential effect of sin. He has assured this wondrous power of His benevolent grace to every Jew who fulfills the true purpose of Yom Kippur by doing teshuva, true repentance. Thus we cry out to Him “Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes” for in the words of the prophet, Hashem alone blots out our transgressions.

According to the Targum the sentence reads: @hh<HEB>כִּי בַיּוֹם הַזֶה יְכַפֵּר עֲלֵיכֶם לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם@ee<ENG>. “For on this day He will make atonement for you to cleanse you from all your sins”; and thus the final three words of the sentence @hh<HEB>לִפְנֵי ה' תִּטְהָרוּ@ee<ENG> represent a command to cleanse ourselves before Him, as the Targum says: @hh<HEB>וְאַתּוּן קָדָם ה' תּוֹדוּן סוּרְחָנוּתְכוֹן וְתִדְכּוּן@ee<ENG> “And you—confess your wrongdoings before Hashem, and then you will be cleansed.” Klei Yakar, obviously influenced by Targum explicitly states that this sentence is not a blanket promise of atonement, for Yom Kippur atones only for those who cleanse themselves with honest repentance.

@b1<EM><EN><*148>148@b2<EN>The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as Hashem’s slaves (Vayikra 25:42), and as His children (Devorim 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King. Contrary to the view that Hashem the Father is so full of love for His children that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that Hashem the King must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to Hashem—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!
@b1<EM><EN><*149>149@b2<EN>Despite our physical banishment and spiritual estrangement—the result of our sins—we still have none other than Hashem to guide our lives and to shape our destiny.

@b1<EM><EN><*151>151@b2<EN>Having just asked that our sins be forgiven and that our transgressions be removed from before His eyes, what are we asking for now? Our earlier pleas were for forgiveness of those sins we committed ourselves. But there are sins for which we are held accountable even though we do not commit them ourselves. One possibility is that of watching while others sin when we may have been able to prevent it. (Chazal say @hh<HEB>כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל עֲרֵבִין זֶה לָזֶה@hh@ee<ENG>. A guarantor is one who countersigns a debt note, undertaking to pay if the borrower defaults. Thus we ask Hashem to erase all our notes of obligation whether as borrower or guarantor. In all instances He is the Extender of credit.) Thus we beseech Hashem to erase the records of our guilt in those instances.—Siach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*152>152@b2<EN>Many repent out of their fear of Hashem. Others repent out of their love for Him. We beseech Hashem to bring us back in “wholehearted” repentance motivated by love, the most perfect form of penitence.—Etz Yosef

@b1<EM><EN><*159>159@b2<EN>This verse alludes to Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. “Hear my voice,” refers to Rosh Hashana when we sound the shofar.

@b1<EM><EN><*160>160@b2<EN>Even if I were so depraved that my own mother and father would abandon me to my own devices, Hashem would still gather me up and believe in my ability to mend my ways.—S.R. Hirsch

He is punished, however, only for his act of wickedness, not for the consequences of his deed.—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*13>13@b2<EN>The word “blessed” is similar in concept to the words: “merciful” or “gracious” when applied to Hashem. Just as merciful means that He is merciful, the source of mercy; so too, blessed means that He is the source of blessing.—Avudraham
@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>Generally speaking, the name Adonoy is understood as it is pronounced—Adonoy—my Master, and indicates His rule and providence of the universe.

@b1<EM><EN><*47>47@b2<EN>If these blessings were intended to increase the population of Avraham’s descendants, it was superfluous, since Hashem had previously blessed him for that purpose. Hashem here blessed the descendants of Avraham with the nobility of spirit and courage to fulfill the command to sanctify Hashem even when self-sacrifice is required. Only the nation of Yisrael, Avraham’s children, were commanded to fulfill this mitzvah, because of the legacy we inherited from him. —Ha’amek Dovor.

@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>Some people conduct themselves in a God-fearing manner in the presence of others (in public), but in the privacy of their homes, do whatever they please. There are others who do just the opposite. In private they are governed by fear of Hashem, but in the presence of others they are too embarrassed or intimidated to be God-fearing. A Jew must always fear Hashem, in private as well as in public.—Si’ach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*51>51@b2<EN>Acknowledging the truth is fundamental to serving Hashem, and to all human behavior. One who is concerned merely with “winning the argument” will go to any extreme to come out on top. This attitude caused the downfall of the 250 leaders who joined Korach, rather than acknowledge the truth of Moshe’s declaration (Bamidbar 16:2±35).—Si’ach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*52>52@b2<EN>It is not sufficient to merely acknowledge the truth verbally but one must speak truth in his heart as well. Rashi on the Talmud (Maseches Makos 24a) cites the following incident as an example of how one should speak truth in his heart: A buyer once offered to purchase an article from Rav Safra while he was reciting the Shema. Because he could not indicate his acceptance, the anxious purchaser increased his offer. Rav Safra refused the increment because in his heart he had already accepted the original offer.

@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>Radak writes that the Hebrew word @hh<HEB>דִלִיתָנִי@ee<ENG> is an expression used to describe either a downtrodden or an uplifted state. The downtrodden state of the Jewish people is actually part of their uplifting says the Sfas Emes, as it is said, “when I was brought low, He delivered me” (Tehillim 116:6). “My downtrodden state was the cause of my salvation,” proclaims Dovid, just as when one lowers a bucket (@hh<HEB>דְלִי@ee<ENG>) into a well in order to bring up the water.
@b1<EM><EN><*3>3@b2<EN>The literal translation of @hh<HEB>זֵכֶר קָדְשׁו@ee<ENG> is His ‘holy remembrance,’ but it refers to His Name; for the titles we bestow upon Him are our means of remembering Him.—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*4>4@b2<EN>A moment is a measure of time. Hashem’s anger is limited to time (be it long or short) but Hashem’s favor is unlimited.—Sfas Emes
@b1<EM><EN><*5>5@b2<EN>The literal translation of @hh<HEB>כָבוד@ee<ENG> is glory. Rabbi Yerucham Levovitz explained that the soul is called @hh<HEB>כָבוד@ee<ENG> because its only function is to give glory to Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*6>6@b2<EN>Hashem’s saying and doing are synonymous and simultaneous as it is said, “By the word of Hashem the heavens were made” (Tehillim 33:6).—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*7>7@b2<EN>“Says and does” refers to those things that are not lasting and must be renewed whereas, “He decrees and fulfills,” refers to those things that have @hh<HEB>קִיוּם@ee<ENG>, and last forever.—Tzelosa d’Avraham
@b1<EM><EN><*8>8@b2<EN>Not only is Hashem’s compassionate providence concerned with the earth and enduring things, but His compassion and providence extend even to those creatures which are destined to perish.—Avudraham

@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>The entire section—the previous verses as well as the following verses—are addressed to the Jewish People, who are the seed of Yisrael, the chosen of Hashem, who are asked to remember His wonders, miracles and laws.—Tzelosa d’Avraham
@b1<EM><EN><*15>15@b2<EN>This verse in following the preceding verse indicates that the original covenant which Hashem made with Avraham was later confirmed to Yitzchok in an oath and then established for Yaakov as a statute. After Yaakov was given the name Yisrael, it became an everlasting covenant.—Tzelosa d’Avraham
@b1<EM><EN><*16>16@b2<EN>Both Pharaoh and Avimelech were admonished for Avraham’s sake (Bereishis 13:17; 20:3,7).
@b1<EM><EN><*17>17@b2<EN>The Hebrew word @hh<HEB> מְשִׁיחָי@ee<ENG> can also be translated as “My great ones” and as such refers to the Patriarchs. “My prophets” refers to the Matriarchs, who were known to be prophets. Both were afforded extraordinary Divine protection.—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*18>18@b2<EN>Siach Yitzchok maintains that this verse directs Jewry to sing to Hashem in all the lands in which they are dispersed during their exile. Tzelosa d’Avraham understands the verse to direct all the nations of the earth to sing to Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*19>19@b2<EN>a) We are to proclaim our deliverance by Hashem every day; b) We are to proclaim that our deliverance by Hashem is a daily experience.—Tzelosa d’Avraham
@b1<EM><EN><*20>20@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>הוד @ee<ENG> (beauty) indicates that which is itself beautiful, while @hh<HEB>הָדָר @ee<ENG> (splendor) is the reflection of beauty. For example: the sun’s light is “beauty” itself while the moon’s light is splendor—a reflection of the sun. (This definition applies only to the Hebrew terms.)—Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*21>21@b2<EN>Etz Yosef understands this as the “holy splendor” of Hashem’s Sanctuary. Tzelosa d’Avraham sees it as the splendor and joy of worship before Hashem, as contrasted with secular, frivolous manifestations of beauty and splendor.
@b1<EM><EN><*22>22@b2<EN>Simcha (rejoicing) describes one’s feelings at a new experience of happiness, whereas gila (exultation) describes the feeling one experiences over an ongoing situation of joy. Since there is nothing new on the earth @hh<HEB> וְאֵין כָּל-חָדָשׁ תַּחַת הַשָּׁמֶשׁ@ee<ENG> (Koheles 1:9), it is said the earth will exult (gila); but the heavens will rejoice (simcha) because there is @hh<HEB>חִידוּשׁ@ee<ENG> in the heavens.—Gaon of Vilna

@b1<EM><EN><*26>26@b2<EN>Mount Moriah upon which the Holy Temple was built is holy itself even when the Temple is destroyed. The previous verse refers to the time of the Temple, the second verse refers to the period of its destruction.—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*27>27@b2<EN>@hh<HEB>חֶסֶד@ee<ENG> (kindness) is the good Hashem bestows without a promise, whereas @hh<HEB>אֱמֶת @ee<ENG> (truth) is the fulfillment of His promise.—Siach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*28>28@b2<EN>Hashem’s mercies to mankind started from the very day that Adam was created. Hashem created the world in order to fill it with kindness as it is said: “A world of kindness was built” (Tehillim 89:3).—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*29>29@b2<EN>Attribute your victories to Hashem’s might rather than to your own.—Siach Yitzchok. Rashbam and others hold that since Hashem’s actions are a reflection of Yisrael’s deeds, the latter are, in a sense, the source of His might. Thus when Yisrael follows the wishes of Hashem, they give might to Him.
@b1<EM><EN><*30>30@b2<EN>There is a spiritual Temple in the heavens which corresponds to the Temple on earth.—Radak. The Talmud (Maseches Zevachim 115b) notes that the word @hh<HEB> מִמִּקְדָּשֶׁיךָ@ee<ENG> may also be read @hh<HEB>מִמְקוּדָשֶׁיךָ@ee<ENG>, from Your holy people, indicating that Hashem is especially demanding of the most adherent to the Torah. When this occurs, the world is filled with awe and fear of Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*31>31@b2<EN>These two verses (94:1±2) are an appeal to Hashem during a time fraught with the sufferings of exile, when it seems as if Hashem has forsaken His people. He is urged to reveal Himself as the Mighty champion of justice—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*32>32@b2<EN>Only Hashem knows what is true deliverance for a person. Prayer is not always answered, because Hashem in His infinite wisdom knows that granting the request is not always for our benefit. We must therefore bless and offer thanks to Hashem regardless of whether our petition has been granted.—Siach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*33>33@b2<EN>Radak understands Dovid to be asking Hashem to raise the People of Yisrael above their enemies. Ibn Ezra says that Hashem is being asked to act like a shepherd who brings his flock to high ground to save them from beasts of prey.
@b1<EM><EN><*34>34@b2<EN>We hope to earn redemption through our deeds, but if we are found wanting, then “show us Your kindness”—overlook our deficiencies and “grant” us salvation.—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*35>35@b2<EN>Request all that you desire and I will fulfill every request.—Ibn Ezra. The Yerushalayim Talmud (Maseches Taanis 3:6) indicates that the more one requests Hashem’s providence—the “wider he opens his mouth”—the more he shows his belief in Hashem’s ability to provide all of man’s needs.
@b1<EM><EN><*36>36@b2<EN>The foremost level of man’s trust in Hashem is manifested in three situations: a)<TIE>when he is confronted with trouble, b)<TIE>when he seeks help, and c)<TIE>after he has been helped. The Psalmist says: In my time of trouble, I trust in Your kindliness; I seek only Your help, for my heart exults in Your salvation; and I will sing to You afterwards for You have dealt kindly with me.—Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*37>37@b2<EN>@hh<HEB>שָׁמַיִם@ee<ENG>, skies, refers to the heavenly regions beyond earth’s atmosphere, where the stars and planets orbit. @hh<HEB>רָקִיעַ@ee<ENG>, firmament, refers to the earth’s atmosphere where clouds form, and precipitation takes place. The verb @hh<HEB>לְסַפֵּר@ee<ENG> means to recount something which occurred in the past. Thus the stars and planets in the @hh<HEB>שָׁמַיִם@ee<ENG> recount the fact that long ago Hashem created a glorious universe. The @hh<HEB>רָקִיעַ@ee<ENG>, on the other hand, relates that Hashem’s handiwork is evidenced in the constant formation of clouds and in the precipitation of rain. The firmament enables man to recognize the constant renewal of Hashem’s providence.—Malbim

@b1<EM><EN><*41>41@b2<EN>Hashem provided the sun a permanent residence in the heavens. Dovid describes this point to which the sun returns daily as its ‘tent’—its residence in the sky.—Metsudas Yehoshua
@b1<EM><EN><*42>42@b2<EN>When the groom steps out of the bridal chamber, everyone rushes to greet him with great joy. Analogously, when the sun rises each day, all of creation rejoices.—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*43>43@b2<EN>A warrior is happy for the opportunity to go into battle because he has confidence in his skill and strength. Similarly, the sun rejoices knowing it will serve its Creator’s goals by running its course.—Metsudas Dovid.

@b1<EM><EN><*48>48@b2<EN>Dovid’s request is  paraphrased in the concluding blessing of the @hh<HEB>בִּרְכוֹת הַשַּׁחַר@ee<ENG>, where we say @hh<HEB>וְאַל יִשְׁלֹט בָּנוּ יֵצֶר הָרַע@ee<ENG>, “Let us not be ruled by the Evil Inclination.” Dovid knows full well that Hashem does not interfere with man’s free choise; he only asks for Divine help to keep him from becoming a prisoner of evil.—Gaon of Vilna
@b1<EM><EN><*49>49@b2<EN>Dovid is proud that he is worthy of uttering Hashem’s Name.
@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>Dovid describes himself as a helpless indigent waiting for Hashem’s compassion.—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*51>51@b2<EN>Seporno says that taste refers to the senses whereas “see” refers to the intellect.
@b1<EM><EN><*52>52@b2<EN>Dovid does not say @hh<HEB>הֶחָפֵץ בַּחַיִּים@ee<ENG> ‘he who takes pleasure in life’ but @hh<HEB>הֶחָפֵץ חַיִּים@ee<ENG>, ‘he who desires life,’ whose only goal is life; that is, he desires to attain such a level of existence as can truly be called life.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*53>53@b2<EN>The expression @hh<HEB>פְּנֵי ה'@ee<ENG>, Face of Hashem, describes Divine anger. See Vayikra 20:5, @hh<HEB>וֵשַׂמְתִּי אֲנִי אֶת פָּנַי בָּאִישׁ הַהוּא@ee<ENG>, “And I will set My Face against that man.”

@b1<EM><EN><*73>73@b2<EN>This refrain is repeated in all twenty-six verses of the Psalm. We thereby declare that each act of kindliness for which we thank Hashem is not of a temporary nature, lasting merely a day or a year.

@b1<EM><EN><*74>74@b2<EN>The sea was divided into twelve parts, so that each tribe crossed on its own route.
@b1<EM><EN><*75>75@b2<EN>The twenty-six verses in this psalm symbolize the twenty six generations of man from Creation till the Torah was given. These generations were sustained solely by virtue of Hashem’s kindliness even though they did not have the merit of Torah.
@b1<EM><EN><*76>76@b2<EN>The Talmud (Sanhedrin 37a) states: When a man mints many coins from the same mold, they are all exactly alike, but Hashem formed all of mankind from Adam and no two men look exactly alike. The Sages in Berachos 58a add: just as no two faces are alike, so are no two personalities alike. Thus even though Hashem made them all together, each has his own unique personality.
@b1<EM><EN><*77>77@b2<EN>Shabbos, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to Hashem. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. These pursuits lead him to serve Hashem and to praise Him.—Radak

@b1<EM><EN><*142>142@b2<EN>“Alone” means without intermediaries (Malbim); also without the beneficiary’s awareness (Gaon of Vilna).
@b1<EM><EN><*143>143@b2<EN>Tehillim 72:18±19. This verse will be fulfilled in Messianic times when all men will be invested with a true awareness of Hashem’s majesty.

@b1<EM><EN><*144>144@b2<EN>Dovid singles out Yaakov because he was the first Patriarch to mention building a house of Hashem (Bereishis 28:22), “Then shall this stone which I have set for a pillar be Hashem’s house.”—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*145>145@b2<EN>Dovid thus renders unto Hashem the greatness Hashem has given him. His might in war, his victories in battle, and the majesty of his kingdom, are all due to Hashem’s providence.—Iyun T’filah
@b1<EM><EN><*146>146@b2<EN>I Divrei Hayomim 29:10±13.
@b1<EM><EN><*147>147@b2<EN>This is an affirmation of Hashem’s unity: “Adonoy is One.”
@b1<EM><EN><*148>148@b2<EN>This denotes the highest of the seven heavens.
@b1<EM><EN><*149>149@b2<EN>This signifies the sun, moon, and stars.

@b1<EM><EN><*151>151@b2<EN>This was not a mere changing of names. Avraham was elevated and attained new stature as a patriarch by virtue of his new name.

@b1<EM><EN><*153>153@b2<EN>In some congregations, @hh<HEB>וְכָרות@ee<ENG> is recited responsively on the day of a circumcision. Consequently, some siddurim indicate that a new paragraph begins here. But it is actually a continuation of the verse.

@b1<EM><EN><*160>160@b2<EN>The use of the word “hand” or any physical attribute with regard to Hashem is merely metaphorical, since Hashem is in no way physical.
@b1<EM><EN><*161>161@b2<EN>When people praise a mortal, they often declare undeserved praise. But Hashem is so great that any praise we offer is insufficient.—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*162>162@b2<EN>This translation follows Rashi’s commentary.
@b1<EM><EN><*163>163@b2<EN>This verse is also translated, “You will send forth Your fury: it will consume them like straw.” According to the Zohar it thus refers to the time of the Resurrection, when Hashem will destroy all the wicked.

@b1<EM><EN><*165>165@b2<EN>Seporno and others interpret the verse to read: “They, the mighty, sank like lead in the waters,” “mighty,” referring to the Egyptian officers rather than to the waters.
@b1<EM><EN><*166>166@b2<EN>Hashem is “awesome in praise” for we fear that all our praise will prove inadequate. In truth, it is impossible to praise Hashem fully, and Dovid therefore said (Tehillim 65:2) “For You, silence is praise.”—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*167>167@b2<EN>The Philistines had killed the Ephraimites thirty years earlier when they left Egypt by force. The Philistines were thus gripped with terror when they heard that Yisrael had escaped from Egypt.—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*168>168@b2<EN>Nations on all sides panicked: The Philistines to the west, the Edomites to the south, the Moavites to the east and the Canaanites to the north. The Philistines feared revenge. The Edomites panicked because they feared that Yisrael would now seek revenge for what Esau (Edom) had done to Yaakov. The Moavites, the descendants of Lot, feared they would be punished because of the dispute between Lot and Avraham (Bereishis 13:7). Canaan “melted away” because they realized that Yisrael was destined to take their land, and their astrologers told them that there was no way out.—Rabbainu Bachyah

@b1<EM><EN><*172>172@b2<EN>This verse is not repeated in Shemos. But it is repeated in prayer to signify the end of the Ode, just as the last verse of Tehillim 150 is repeated in the prayer whereas it is not repeated in the Tehillim.—Avudraham

@b1<EM><EN><*174>174@b2<EN>Shemos 14:30±15:19.
@b1<EM><EN><*175>175@b2<EN>Tehillim 22:29. The word “king” signifies one whose leadership is accepted freely by all his subjects. Therefore, in reference to Yisrael who willingly accept the Kingship of Hashem, it says, “For the kingship is Adonoy’s.” A “ruler,” however, is one who forcibly rules people, without their consent. Regarding the nations who do not willingly submit to Adonoy’s Kingship, the Psalmist says, “And He rules over nations.”—Gaon of Vilna

@b1<EM><EN><*179>179@b2<EN>Etz Yosef assumes that @hh<HEB>תּוֹלָדוֹת@ee<ENG> refers to events that occur in time. [See Mishlei 27:1, @hh<HEB>כִּי לֹא תֵדַע מַה יֻלַּד יוֹם@ee<ENG>, for you do not know what a day may bring forth.] Thus Hashem is Master of all events.

For example, when one shapes a wooden table, to make it round, he “forms” the wood, the original substance which was “created.” Similarly, Hashem “forms the light” which is His act of modifying or limiting the darkness He created. —Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>Making, @hh<HEB>עושֶׂה@ee<ENG>, is the act of completion, such as when one completes a table by painting it.

@b1<EM><EN><*3>3@b2<EN>The verse in Yeshaya (45:7) on which this blessing is based concludes with the words, “and creates evil.” In His original creation Hashem created the potential for evil, which He constantly limits and controls as the Former and Maker.—Siddur HaGra

@b1<EM><EN><*11>11@b2<EN>A name of Hashem (Bereishis 17:1; 35:11; 43:14 etc.) which refers to His setting boundaries and limits throughout creation.
@b1<EM><EN><*12>12@b2<EN>The Heavenly throne is thus conceived of as surrounded by angels and all the adoring heavenly bodies.—See Yeshaya 6:12
@b1<EM><EN><*13>13@b2<EN>Those of His creatures capable of praising Him do so. The rest are evidence of His astonishing wisdom and arouse the others to praise Him.
@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>This is an allusion to the sun, rising in the east. Hashem opens the doors each day to permit the sun to rise. Every sunrise is thus an act of Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*15>15@b2<EN>Hashem saw that the world could not exist if He were to govern it on the basis of His attribute of pure justice. He therefore joined His attribute of compassion with that of justice and dispenses both justice and mercy as He sees fit.—Avudraham

Targum Yonoson paraphrases this verse: “Holy [is Hashem] in the highest heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His almighty power; holy [is He] forever and for all eternity.” The Talmud, (Maseches Chulin 91b) refers to this verse as the “Sanctification of the Angels.” According to Avudraham and Yaavetz, this Kedushah has been inserted here to refute those who maintain that Hashem relinquished His control over the heavenly bodies, and they are now able to function independently. We are therefore told that all the heavenly hosts proclaim Hashem’s sanctification and dominion over all the universe.
@b1<EM><EN><*41>41@b2<EN>Ofanim, Chayos haKodash, Serafim are various classes of Angels. Ofanim denotes animated wheels as conceived in association with the Heavenly throne. (Avudraham); Chayos are those angels who exist eternally (Yaavetz; some angels exist only for short times for specific functions.) Serafim indicate “beings of fire.”
@b1<EM><EN><*42>42@b2<EN>Yechezkel 3:12. According to the Kuzari, Hashem’s glory is a euphemism for Hashem Himself. Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: Hashem is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view set forth in the Kuzari is that “Hashem’s glory” includes the angels, His throne, His chariot, the firmament, and the spheres. These are called Hashem’s glory similar to a king’s retinue which is his royal splendor.

@b1<EM><EN><*44>44@b2<EN>Rabbi Pinchos ben Yair was given two measures of barley for safekeeping. The owner forgot about it for a number of years. Rabbi Pinchos ben Yair planted the barley seed, and each year replanted the previous year’s harvest until it grew to be a substantial crop. After seven years, the owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchos told him, “Come I will show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” Hashem does the same with the good and righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive his reward, Hashem returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated dividends. Midrash Rabba, Devorim 3:6
@b1<EM><EN><*45>45@b2<EN>Since the blessing began with the praise of Hashem as the Former of light Who continually renews the creation, it concludes on the same note.
@b1<EM><EN><*46>46@b2<EN>Tehillim 136:7.
@b1<EM><EN><*47>47@b2<EN>We pray that we will be worthy of enjoying the original light of creation, which Hashem put aside for the righteous in the future world.—Yaavetz
@b1<EM><EN><*48>48@b2<EN>When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—Kuzari
@b1<EM><EN><*49>49@b2<EN>The Kuzari writes, “When reciting the blessing ‘Unbounded Love’ @hh<HEB>אַהֲבָה רַבָּה@ee<ENG>, one should bear in mind that Hashem’s Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of Hashem’s will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called love.”
@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>Hashem bestowed His great and abundant pity on us after we sinned in making the golden calf. He not only pardoned us, but gave us the Second Tablets and ordained the construction of the Tabernacle (Mishkan) for His Divine Presence to dwell among us.—Siach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*51>51@b2<EN>We preserve the Torah by not forgetting its teachings; we practice the commandments and we fulfill them by making them permanent parts of our lives.—Siach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*52>52@b2<EN>Make us single-hearted and undivided in our love and reverence of Your Name. Keep us from distraction of personal thoughts and selfish motives.—Siach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*53>53@b2<EN>When one has to receive a favor that is completely undeserved, he feels a sense of shame. We therefore pray to Hashem, that our redemption will not be a “hand out” without merit and cause us to be ashamed. We proclaim that since we “trusted in His Name” and accepted the bitterness of our exile, our deliverance is not totally undeserved.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*54>54@b2<EN>May we return from our exile with our heads held high, not in meekness.—Siach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*55>55@b2<EN>Even if we do not deserve to be saved in our own merit, save us anyhow because You perform acts of deliverance.
@b1<EM><EN><*56>56@b2<EN>At the moment Hashem gave the Torah to the Jews at Sinai, we became His chosen people and were brought close to Him for eternity.—Siach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*57>57@b2<EN>These final words complete the prayer begun earlier: “Bring us in peace, and lead us upright to our land, so that we may give thanks to You, and proclaim Your Oneness, with love.—Siach Yitzchok 
@b1<EM><EN><*58>58@b2<EN>Devorim 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word @hh<HEB>שְׁמַע@ee<ENG> and last letter of @hh<HEB>אֶחָד@ee<ENG> are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word @hh<HEB>עֵד@ee<ENG> “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to Hashem’s unity. —Avudraham
@sn<EM><EN>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on Hashem’s unity. The last word, @hh<HEB>אֶחָד@ee<ENG> “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that Hashem, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Yisrael, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.
@b1<EM><EN><*59>59@b2<EN>Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Yisrael” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Yaakov said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moshe did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Yaakov ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a.
@sn<EM><EN>When Moshe went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise Hashem by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say @hh<HEB>בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם@ee<ENG> aloud.—Midrash Rabba to Devorim
@b1<EM><EN><*60>60@b2<EN>Our Sages (Sifrei to Devorim 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to Hashem’s Law and make them instruments for His service.
@b1<EM><EN><*61>61@b2<EN>The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved Hashem with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.
@b1<EM><EN><*62>62@b2<EN>The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to Hashem and to Torah might entail.

@b1<EM><EN><*65>65@b2<EN>Devorim 6:5±9. This paragraph contains 10 commandments: 1) accepting the “yoke” of heaven; 2) proclaiming the Unity of Hashem; 3) loving Hashem; 4) studying Torah (and you shall speak of them); 5) teaching your children; 6±7) reciting Shema in the evening and in the morning; 8±9) putting on the tefillin of the hand and head; 10) putting up mezuzos on the doorposts.
@b1<EM><EN><*66>66@b2<EN>The service of the heart is prayer, as Dovid said (Tehillim 141:2) “May my prayers be acceptable to You as an incense [service].”
@b1<EM><EN><*67>67@b2<EN>Hashem will make it rain at night so as not to cause you discomfort.—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*68>68@b2<EN>Reward and punishment are here connected with the rainfalls vital to the Land of Yisrael. The heavy rains which open the growing season in the fall and the showers which fall while the grain is ripening are of utmost importance.

@b1<EM><EN><*70>70@b2<EN>No extension will be given. The “generation of the flood” was granted a reprieve of 120 years (Bereishis 6:3) because they did not have from whom to learn; but you do have from whom to learn.—Sifrei, cited by Rashi

@b1<EM><EN><*74>74@b2<EN>Rabbi Yehuda bar Chaviva said that this third section was added to Shema because of six important things contained therein: 1. the commandment of fringes, 2. mention of the Exodus, 3. the call to assume the yoke of Hashem’s commandments, 4. the warning against heretical concepts, 5. the warning against straying after sinful desires, and 6. the warning against idolatrous worship.—Maseches Berachos 12b
@b1<EM><EN><*75>75@b2<EN>Rabbi Meir says: “the blue thread of the fringes resembles the sea, the sea reflects the heavens, and heavens resemble the Throne of Glory” (Sifrei). The outward act of looking upon the tzitzis leads the Jew to inward spiritual conformity with the precepts of Hashem.

@b1<EM><EN><*81>81@b2<EN>All that was affirmed above in Shema.
@b1<EM><EN><*82>82@b2<EN>After having affirmed that all that was said in Shema is true, firm, certain, enduring, etc., we take an oath and testify that we accept the “yoke of heaven” upon ourselves as did our fathers before us and as will our children after us, forever and ever. Thus we say in the following prayer: “For our fathers, for us, for our children and for our descendants—Your word is good and lasting—a Law that will never be abrogated.”—Kuzari
@b1<EM><EN><*83>83@b2<EN>The word help indicates that the recipient also participated in his rescue, whereas the words shield and deliverer indicate that the rescue was made without any help from the rescued party. Our fathers who were righteous, participated in their rescue, and Hashem “helped” them. Since we are not that righteous, Hashem shields and delivers us even though we have no merit.—Siach Yitzchok

@b1<EM><EN><*85>85@b2<EN>“Your Torah” means the basic concepts of the Torah itself, and “Your word” refers to ethical concepts, derived from events described in the Torah and by the Prophets.—Siach Yitzchok

@sn<EM><EN>Our faith in the Redeemer of Yisrael Who redeemed us from Egypt, and our hope that He will redeem us from exile, give us the spiritual energy and courage to stand before Him, to pray and beseech Him for our needs, as we proceed to the Amidah.—Yesodos haTefillah
<CH12>@b1<EM><EN><*1>1@b2<EN>Rabbi Yonasan Eibschitz in his sefer, Yaaros Devash, explains that upon reflecting in Whose Presence he is about to pray, man should be so overwhelmed with awe and trepidation that he is unable to open his lips. He therefore prefaces his prayer by beseeching Hashem, to open his lips, asking His help to be able to pray in His Presence.
@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>Because these are days of judgment and our lives hang in the balance, we pray to Hashem to remember us for life (Rashi, Levush).

@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@hh@ee<ENG>, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ@ee<ENG> and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@ee<ENG> recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.
@b1<EM><EN><*15>15@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>תֵּן@hh@ee<ENG> implies @hh<HEB>מַתָּנָה@hh@ee<ENG>, a gift. We ask Hashem to grant us the feeling of reverence for Him, as a gift, knowing how difficult it is to attain such a high level of reverence completely on our own (Siach Yitzchok).
@b1<EM><EN><*16>16@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>מַעֲשֶׂיךָ@hh@ee<ENG>, lit., Your works, indicates that which has attained or is near perfection. Thus Yisrael is called His works since we have accepted His Kingship and His Torah which is the fulfillment of Hashem’s creation (Siach Yitzchok).
@b1<EM><EN><*17>17@b2<EN>All you have created, @hh<HEB>שֶׁבָּרָאתָ@hh@ee<ENG>, indicates that which has not attained its fulfillment, thus we ask Hashem to cast His dread even on those people who have not yet accepted His Divine Kingdom (Siach Yitzchok).
@b1<EM><EN><*18>18@b2<EN>The nation of Yisrael will fear You.
@b1<EM><EN><*19>19@b2<EN>The nations of the world will finally prostrate themselves before You, i.e. submit to You and accept the yoke of Your Kingship.
@b1<EM><EN><*20>20@b2<EN>Once all of Your works and created beings have submitted themselves to Your rule and formed a single bond to do Your will, the honor of Yisrael will be established and raised to new heights. It will then be apparent to all that Yisrael alone carried the yoke of Hashem’s Kingdom throughout the bitter years of exile, giving Him obedience despite its suffering and persecution and the taunts of those who cynically asked, “Where is Your God?” (Etz Yosef).
@b1<EM><EN><*21>21@b2<EN>Those who fear Hashem will then be praiseworthy in the eyes of all men.
@b1<EM><EN><*22>22@b2<EN>Those who seek Hashem and search for ways to serve Him will no longer be considered ridiculous.

@b1<EM><EN><*24>24@b2<EN>See Tehillim 132:17. The climax of this spiritual renaissance will be the restoration of our people to our land under the scepter of the Moshiach, descendant of Dovid, the anointed of Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*25>25@b2<EN>The entire universe was created for the sake of Yisrael in order that Hashem’s Divine Influence be attached to it. This essence (Yisrael) was created for the sake of an even more treasured essence, namely the prophets and the pious among them. This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashanah±Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).
@b1<EM><EN><*26>26@b2<EN>Forgiveness, (@hh<HEB>מְחִילָה@ee<ENG>) implies a waiver of punishment which is due the guilty party.
@b1<EM><EN><*27>27@b2<EN>Pardon, (@hh<HEB>סְלִיחָה@ee<ENG>) implies that the earlier relationship between the sinner and the Pardoner will not be blemished because of the wrongdoing of the sinner.
@b1<EM><EN><*28>28@b2<EN>Atonement (@hh<HEB>כַּפָּרָה@ee<ENG>) implies total acquittal of the consequences of our wrongful acts.
@b1<EM><EN><*29>29@b2<EN>Were it not for the intervention of the wondrous power of Hashem’s grace, our moral and physical entity would have long ceased, as a consequence of our transgressions. This would have been our fate in accordance with the law of cause and effect which functions in Hashem’s world according to His will. It is only Hashem Himself, He Who originally ordained that law, Who in the omnipotence of His will, can also suspend that law. Only He can cause the wrong which was done to become as if it had never occurred. Only Hashem can uproot in its entirety the sin and consequential effect of sin. He has assured this wondrous power of His benevolent grace to every Jew who fulfills the true purpose of Yom Kippur by doing teshuva, true repentance. Thus we cry out to Him “Blot out and remove our transgressions and sins from before Your eyes” for in the words of the prophet, Hashem alone blots out our transgressions.
@b1<EM><EN><*30>30@b2<EN>Were Hashem to destroy us because of our transgressions, His Name would be desecrated among the nations of the world. Thus says the prophet, He blots out our transgressions for His own sake.—Metsudas Dovid

@b1<EM><EN><*31>31@b2<EN>Yeshaya 42:25. This implies that our sins will be blotted out so thoroughly that not even the slightest trace will remain. Thus says Hashem, “and your sins, I will not recall” because there will be nothing left to recall.—Metsudas Dovid
@b1<EM><EN><*32>32@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>פְּשָׁעֶיךָ@ee<ENG>, your transgressions, which implies a wanton disregard of Hashem’s will is compared to an @hh<HEB>עָב@ee<ENG>, a thick cloud. Just as a thick cloud darkens the earth so too, our transgressions cause darkness in our lives.—Malbim
@b1<EM><EN><*33>33@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>חַטֹּאתֶיךָ@ee<ENG>, your sins, which implies error, or sins committed unknowingly, is compared to an @hh<HEB>עָנָן@ee<ENG>, a mist cloud, which does not cause such terrible darkness. So too, our sins do not create such severe blackness in our lives.—Malbim
@b1<EM><EN><*34>34@b2<EN>Yeshaya 44:22
@b1<EM><EN><*35>35@b2<EN>In our translation, the words, @hh<HEB>מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם@ee<ENG> are joined with the words @hh<HEB>לִפְנֵי ה' תִּטְהָרוּ@ee<ENG>, thus reading “from all your sins before Adonoy, you will be cleansed”; implying that the entire sentence is a statement of fact, i.e., that Yom Kippur is a day in which Hashem atones our sins. According to Targum Yonassan ben Uziel, however, the words @hh<HEB>מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם@ee<ENG> are joined to the previous words—@hh<HEB>לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם@ee<ENG>—changing the entire concept of the sentence. According to the Targum the sentence reads: @hh<HEB>כִּי בַיּוֹם הַזֶה יְכַפֵּר עֲלֵיכֶם לְטַהֵר אֶתְכֶם מִכֹּל חַטֹאתֵיכֶם@ee<ENG>. “For on this day He will make atonement for you to cleanse you from all your sins”; and thus the final three words of the sentence @hh<HEB>לִפְנֵי ה' תִּטְהָרוּ@ee<ENG> represent a command to cleanse ourselves before Him, as the Targum says: @hh<HEB>וְאַתּוּן קָדָם ה' תּוֹדוּן סוּרְחָנוּתְכוֹן וְתִדְכּוּן@ee<ENG> “And you—confess your wrongdoings before Hashem, and then you will be cleansed.” Klei Yakar, obviously influenced by Targum explicitly states that this sentence is not a blanket promise of atonement, for Yom Kippur atones only for those who cleanse themselves with honest repentance.
@b1<EM><EN><*36>36@b2<EN>The words @hh<HEB>סָלְחָן@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>מָחֳלָן@ee<ENG> (Pardoner and Forgiver) indicate that Hashem constantly pardons and forgives. He is not like a king who pardons only at times but His Divine attribute is to be a @hh<HEB>סָלְחָן@ee<ENG> and @hh<HEB>מָחֳלָן@ee<ENG> at all times. He is thus intrinsically a Pardoner and Forgiver.— Pesher Dovor
@b1<EM><EN><*37>37@b2<EN>The literal meaning of @hh<HEB>חַדְרֵי בָטֶן@ee<ENG> is “chambers of the stomach,” but according to Ibn Ezra to Mishlei 20:27, from which the expression is taken, @hh<HEB>חַדְרֵי בָטֶן@ee<ENG> refers to the heart which is the innermost chamber of human thought.

@b1<EM><EN><*78>78@b2<EN>The fluctuating offering is an offering that varies in value according to the financial means of the individual who brings it. (The literal meaning of @hh<HEB>עוֹלָה וְיוֹרֵד@ee<ENG>, is “go up and down”). This type of offering is brought when a person swore falsely (unintentionally) concerning something he did or did not do. For example, one may have thought he ate something and consequently swore that he ate it, but in reality he did not and thus he swore falsely.
@b1<EM><EN><*79>79@b2<EN>This type of sacrifice was brought in an instance where it is uncertain whether or not a violation occurred. For example it is not known whether a substance he ate was of a forbidden nature or if it was permitted.

@b1<EM><EN><*13>13@b2<EN>Tehillim 104:13. Radak explains that this verse is based upon Bereishis 2:6, “And a cloud arose from the land and watered the ground below.”
@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>Tehillim 111:4. The phrase, as it appears in Tehillim, refers to remembrances of the miracles performed during the exodus from Egypt, (the specific remembrance is, however, disputed. Rashi says that it refers to the holidays and Sabbath). In this piyut, however, it might have a more general connotation.
@b1<EM><EN><*15>15@b2<EN>I Shmuel, 2:3.
@b1<EM><EN><*16>16@b2<EN>Tehillim 104:3. The construction of the heavens is described by the commentators to Tehillim 104:3 and Bereishis Rabbah. On the second day of creation, Hashem established the sky within the waters which subsequently separated the “upper waters” from the “lower waters.” Above the upper waters which lie above the sky, a ceiling or roof was placed.
@b1<EM><EN><*17>17@b2<EN>Tehillim 104:2. The creation of light is so described in Bereishis Rabbah 3:4.

@b1<EM><EN><*24>24@b2<EN>In Daniel 7:9, the Throne of Hashem is described as being composed of flashes of fire.
@b1<EM><EN><*25>25@b2<EN>Tehillim 104:4. This refers to the angels who serve Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*26>26@b2<EN>See Yechezkel 1:13. The “heavenly creatures” which sit at Hashem’s Throne are described as being of an intense brightness, which sends out lightning.
@b1<EM><EN><*27>27@b2<EN>In Daniel 7:10, a river of fire is described as coming forth from Hashem’s Throne. Mateh Levi says that the angels immerse themselves in this river before singing their songs of praise. The wicked are condemned and sentenced there, too.
@b1<EM><EN><*28>28@b2<EN>In the Maseches Yoma 21b, our Sages say that the fire of Hashem’s Holy Presence (Shechinah) eats up fire. In Devorim 4:24, Hashem himself is described as a Consumer of fire.
@b1<EM><EN><*29>29@b2<EN>See Maseches Menachos 29b. This refers to this world, and the World to Come.

@b1<EM><EN><*33>33@b2<EN>Tehillim 19:9. Every command of Hashem is flawless, lighting the way for those who walk in His path. Those who ignore His commands stumble in darkness.—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*34>34@b2<EN>See Daniel 2:22.
@b1<EM><EN><*35>35@b2<EN>Tehillim 139:12. Since Hashem does not use human eyes for vision, He has no need for light.—Radak

@b1<EM><EN><*40>40@b2<EN>Unlike a human king who cannot easily rescind his own decrees, Hashem can cancel any decree if the person repents. Hence justice is like a rope in His hand, for he can pull it back at any time, at will.—Mateh Levi
@b1<EM><EN><*41>41@b2<EN>Yeshaya 5:16. When Hashem does justice, his Name becomes great in the world.—Rashi

@b1<EM><EN><*44>44@b2<EN>Tehillim 90:3. Hashem permits the sinner to return in penitence even till the very last moment of his life.—Iyun Tefiloh
@b1<EM><EN><*45>45@b2<EN>Shemos 34:7. According to Rashi the verse refers to the good deeds performed by man rather than to the righteousness of Hashem. Thus He preserves the merit of their righteousness for generations.
@b1<EM><EN><*46>46@b2<EN>Amos 9:11 The specific meaning of the word @hh<HEB>לִגְדוֹר@ee<ENG> in this piyut is not clear. According to Radak and Malbim, it can refer to the Jewish people or to the House of Dovid, thus indicating that Hashem will mend the breaches of our people or those in the royal family of Dovid. Some commentaries say that @hh<HEB>סֻכַּת מְשִׁיחוֹ@ee<ENG> refers to the Holy Temple and @hh<HEB>לִגְדוֹר@ee<ENG> indicates that its walls will be built solidly to last forever. See Mateh Levi.
@b1<EM><EN><*47>47@b2<EN>See Daniel 2:22. The meaning of the word “light” is not clear in this context. Perhaps it refers to the “Or haganuz” (@hh<HEB>אוֹר הַגָנוּז@ee<ENG>) the hidden light which Hashem hid away during the Six Days of Creation to be used for the benefit of the righteous in the World to Come.
@b1<EM><EN><*48>48@b2<EN>According to Mateh Levi. This refers to the songs of prayer sung in the synagogue by the Jewish people.
@b1<EM><EN><*49>49@b2<EN>See Tehillim 24:8. Hashem is victorious over those who wage war with His beloved ones.— Metsudas Dovid. Malbim differentiates between “@hh<HEB>גִבּוֹר@ee<ENG>” which indicates physical strength and “@hh<HEB>גִבּוֹר מִלְחָמָה@ee<ENG>” which indicates military, tactical skill, and savy.
@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>Thus causing them to kill one another. A famous example is that of Gideon’s victory over Midian (Judges 6).
@b1<EM><EN><*51>51@b2<EN>Yeshaya 44:24. Hashem Himself created the entire world during the Six Days of Creation, and with His strength, sustains the creation each and every day.—Radak The verse as it appears in Yeshaya uses only the term “@hh<HEB>עוֹשֶׂה@ee<ENG>” which the Malbim explains as referring to the actual creation of matter ex nihilo. “@hh<HEB>פּוֹעֵל@ee<ENG>” indicates energy and movement.

@b1<EM><EN><*55>55@b2<EN>The Jewish people accept Hashem as their King (Mateh Levi).
@b1<EM><EN><*56>56@b2<EN>This might also be translated, “those who bless Him will inherit the land.” See Tehillim 37:22.
@b1<EM><EN><*57>57@b2<EN>Yeshaya 41:4. Hashem knows all future generations and calls each generation to come into being at its proper time in history.—Ibn Ezra, Metsudas Dovid
@b1<EM><EN><*58>58@b2<EN>Yeshaya 46:10. Hashem revealed the bondage and slavery of the Egyptian exile to Avraham long before the actual events took place. See Bereishis 16:12±14.
@b1<EM><EN><*59>59@b2<EN>Hashem chose Yisrael, who were poorer and fewer in number than other nations, to be His people.—Mateh Levi
@b1<EM><EN><*60>60@b2<EN>Hashem chose them to seek the Torah, which is His might, by learning and expounding on it every day.—Mateh Levi
@b1<EM><EN><*61>61@b2<EN>Tehillim 89:8. Hashem’s glory abides in the company of the angels who are around Him to serve Him (Radak). Mateh Levi explains the verse as meaning that Hashem has placed his Holy Presence (Shechina) in the company of the angels.
@b1<EM><EN><*62>62@b2<EN>Hashem made a path through the Reed Sea for the Jews when they were redeemed from Egypt.—Radak, Ibn Ezra
@b1<EM><EN><*63>63@b2<EN>The word “@hh<HEB>מַרְעִיף@ee<ENG>” is from Devorim 33:28, meaning to drip.
@b1<EM><EN><*64>64@b2<EN>The Krias Shema is recited morning and evening in the synagogues.
@b1<EM><EN><*65>65@b2<EN>II Shmuel 6:2. The two cherubim, on top of the Holy Ark, were a chariot for the Name of Hashem who dwelt upon them in holiness.—Malbim
@b1<EM><EN><*66>66@b2<EN>Yeshaya 10:22
@b1<EM><EN><*67>67@b2<EN>Tehillim 89:7. The term “@hh<HEB>שַׁחַק@ee<ENG>” refers to chambers above the sky where the angels dwell, and from whence come all miracles.—Malbim
@b1<EM><EN><*68>68@b2<EN>The term “@hh<HEB>בְּנֵי אֵלִים@ee<ENG>” literally means “mighty ones.” Metsudas Dovid understands it as referring to the angels, while Ibn Ezra takes it to refer to the stars.
@b1<EM><EN><*69>69@b2<EN>Tehillim 111:5. Rashi interprets “@hh<HEB>טֶרֶף@ee<ENG>” as food. Radak and Ibn Ezra say it refers to the money and valuables which the Egyptians gave to the Jews upon their exodus from Egypt. Metsudas Dovid explains it as denoting the manna bread from heaven, which the Jews ate for forty years in the desert.
@b1<EM><EN><*70>70@b2<EN>Based upon Tehillim 76:12. The word “@hh<HEB>מוֹרָא@ee<ENG>” referring to Hashem has been replaced in the piyut by “@hh<HEB>מוֹרָאָיו@ee<ENG>.” The Jews bring sacrifices to Hashem, whom they fear.
@b1<EM><EN><*71>71@b2<EN>The term “@hh<HEB>עֲמוּסָיו@ee<ENG>” is found in Yeshaya 46:3 and refers to a child who is carried upon the shoulders of his father.
@b1<EM><EN><*72>72@b2<EN>See Yeshaya 59:17
@b1<EM><EN><*73>73@b2<EN>See Yeshaya 46:3. “Yisrael which are borne by Me from the belly, which are carried by Me from the womb.”
@b1<EM><EN><*74>74@b2<EN>The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as Hashem’s slaves (Vayikra 25:42), and as His children (Devorim 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King. Contrary to the view that Hashem the Father is so full of love for His children that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that Hashem the King must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to Hashem—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!
@b1<EM><EN><*75>75@b2<EN>Despite our physical banishment and spiritual estrangement—the result of our sins—we still have none other than Hashem to guide our lives and to shape our destiny.
@b1<EM><EN><*76>76@b2<EN>See Yechezkel 36.
@b1<EM><EN><*77>77@b2<EN>Having just asked that our sins be forgiven and that our transgressions be removed from before His eyes, what are we asking for now? Our earlier pleas were for forgiveness of those sins we committed ourselves. But there are sins for which we are held accountable even though we do not commit them ourselves. One possibility is that of watching while others sin when we may have been able to prevent it. (Chazal say @hh<HEB>כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל עֲרֵבִין זֶה לָזֶה@hh@ee<ENG>. A guarantor is one who countersigns a debt note, undertaking to pay if the borrower defaults. Thus we ask Hashem to erase all our notes of obligation whether as borrower or guarantor. In all instances He is the Extender of credit.) Thus we beseech Hashem to erase the records of our guilt in those instances.—Siach Yitzchok
@b1<EM><EN><*78>78@b2<EN>Many repent out of their fear of Hashem. Others repent out of their love for Him. We beseech Hashem to bring us back in “wholehearted” repentance motivated by love, the most perfect form of penitence.—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*79>79@b2<EN>We beseech Hashem to heal both the spiritually ill as well as the physically ill. We ask, therefore, for a “complete” healing for the sick among us.—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*80>80@b2<EN>Rav S.R. Hirsch translates, “Adonoy is the source of my life’s strength,” thus Dovid declares that Hashem is the fount from which his life derives its power to resist all foes.
@b1<EM><EN><*81>81@b2<EN>Dovid says that he trusts in the declaration stated in the opening verse, “Adonoy is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?”—Rashi, Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*82>82@b2<EN>The literal translation of @hh<HEB>שִׁבְתִּי@ee<ENG> is “my sitting.” The Talmud states that “no man may ‘sit’ in the courtyard of the Temple except for the kings of the House of Dovid.—Maseches Soteh 40b
@b1<EM><EN><*83>83@b2<EN>The Vilna Gaon comments that the commandment of Succos is implied in this verse and the next.
@b1<EM><EN><*84>84@b2<EN>Dovid declares, “Because I look up to Hashem in every aspect of my existence, I am so exalted that no enemy can harm me.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*85>85@b2<EN>This verse alludes to Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. “Hear my voice,” refers to Rosh Hashana when we sound the shofar. The word “my voice (sound)” refers to the “voice” of the shofar. “When I call” refers to Yom Kippur, about which Yeshaya (55:6) said, “call to Him when He is near.”—Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*86>86@b2<EN>Even if I were so depraved that my own mother and father would abandon me to my own devices, Hashem would still gather me up and believe in my ability to mend my ways.—S.R. Hirsch

@b1<EM><EN><*60>60@b2<EN>This was because the entire service on Yom Kippur was performed exclusively by the High Priest. See Rambam (Ch. 1:2,5).
@b1<EM><EN><*61>61@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma Ch. 1:3.
@b1<EM><EN><*62>62@b2<EN>Ibid. The Mishnah continues, “Perhaps you have forgotten (the service), or perhaps you never learned it.” Tiferes Yisroel explains that he himself was asked to read since this would help him best to remember.
@b1<EM><EN><*63>63@b2<EN>Ibid. This was done in order to acquaint him with the animals that he would sacrifice the next day. The goats, however, were not shown to him, for being that they would be an atonement for sin, he might become frightened and shaken.
@b1<EM><EN><*64>64@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma ch. 1:4. During the first six days, he was permitted to eat and drink as much as he wanted. The Mishnah states that too much food and drink could bring about sleep, during which time an emission could occur. He was instructed how to take the handful of spices used for the incense offering of the Day of Atonement.
@b1<EM><EN><*65>65@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma ch. 1:5. The ritual of taking a handful of incense and bringing it in the Holy of Holies was a special service done only on the Day of Atonement and was one of the most difficult of all temple services. Consequently, it was important to instruct him how to perform it.
@b1<EM><EN><*66>66@b2<EN>Ibid. It is a tradition of the oral law that the incense should be placed on the pan of coals inside the Holy of Holies and not outside, as the Sadducees contended. The oath was administered because there were priests who were suspected of being Sadducees (see Rambam 1:7). They made him swear in the Name of Hashem, that he would not change anything of what he was instructed.
@b1<EM><EN><*67>67@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma ch. 1:5. The Rambam writes that it is forbidden by our Torah to suspect someone or to think ill of someone when the matter is in doubt, except if absolutely necessary.
@b1<EM><EN><*68>68@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma ch. 1:6. Since it was necessary that he not fall asleep lest he have an impure emission while sleeping, those around him kept him up all night.
@b1<EM><EN><*69>69@b2<EN>Ibid. For at midnight, the service of Yom Kippur begins with the Terumas HaDeshen, which consisted of removing some of the burnt coals and placing them on the floor next to the Altar. It should be noted that according to the Talmud Maseches Yoma, 19:6 it seems that he did not commence until dawn and that it was therefore necessary to keep him awake until then.
@b1<EM><EN><*70>70@b2<EN>Each day in the Temple there were four lots to determine which kohanim would do the various services. There is a dispute among the commentaries whether lots were drawn also on Yom Kippur or whether these services too (in addition to the main services of sacrifice, sprinkling blood etc.) had to be performed by the High Priest (See Rambam 4:1, Ramban, Tosafos Yeshonim Yoma 20b, Ba’al Meor).
@b1<EM><EN><*71>71@b2<EN><EN>Mishnah Yoma Ch. 2:1. The Terumas Hadeshen was the first service of the day and consisted of the priest going up to the center of the Altar, collecting some burnt coals, and placing them on the floor next to the Altar.
@b1<EM><EN><*72>72@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma Ch. 2:3. According to the Talmud, Yoma 24b, the four choosing’s were not held at one time because they wanted to summon a crowd four times during the day. It is considered an honor to the King to assemble a great multitude in the Temple (@hh<HEB>בְּרוֹב עָם הַדְרַת מֶלֶךְ@ee<ENG>).
@b1<EM><EN><*73>73@b2<EN>The second lot was for picking two priests: one to clean the inner Altar (upon which incense was barred), and a second after him to clean five wicks from the Menorah (Yoma 25:1).
@b1<EM><EN><*74>74@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma Ch. 2:4. The third lot to determine who would burn the incense on the inner Altar was drawn just among the new priests who had not yet performed that service. The reason for this, explains the Talmud, is that this service increases the wealth of the priest who performed it. Therefore, care was taken to give every priest an opportunity to partake of the blessing. It should be noted that all commentaries agree that on Yom Kippur, only the High Priest could burn incense on the inner Altar.
@b1<EM><EN><*75>75@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma Ch. 3:1. A watchman was stationed on a high place in the courtyard (Tifferes Yisroel) to watch for the break of dawn, which signaled the time to proceed with the sacrifice of the daily morning offering, i.e. the Tamid Shel Shachar.
@b1<EM><EN><*76>76@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma Ch. 3:4. Before putting on the eight garments, he immersed himself in the ritual bath, the Mikvah, since whoever enters the Temple Courtyard (Azarah) is required to immerse himself. The opening to the chamber of the mikvah was covered with a linen cloth to symbolize the fact that the special Yom Kippur services would be performed in linen clothes.
@b1<EM><EN><*77>77@b2<EN>Ibid. That is to say, he took off his daily everyday clothes.
@b1<EM><EN><*78>78@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma Ch. 3:4. The High Priest performed his service during the entire year with eight garments, four which were worn by regular priests, and four additional ones. On Yom Kippur he wore two types of clothing. For those services which were not specially performed for Yom Kippur, he wore his usual eight garments. For those services, however, which were performed especially in the Holy of Holies for Yom Kippur, he wore only four white garments (shirt, pants, belt, and hat). Before commencing service, he wore “everyday” clothes, and put on the eight garments of “gold” for the opening service which was the slaughtering of the daily morning sacrifice.
@b1<EM><EN><*79>79@b2<EN>Ibid. It is a positive commandment in the Torah for a priest to wash his hands and feet from a special laver. The initial dressing requires only one washing (afterwards), but the subsequent changes in clothing require one washing before taking off the initial set of clothes and another when dressing in the next set (Rambam 2:2, 4:1).
@b1<EM><EN><*80>80@b2<EN>Ibid. The High Priest performed the minimal cut; the major part of each of the two “signs” which characterize the slaughter of an animal according to the Torah: the gullet and trachea (Rambam 4:1). The reason for this was so that he could quickly receive the blood coming out of the neck of the animal. The slaughter was completed by another priest.
@b1<EM><EN><*81>81@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma Ch. 3:4. Since only the High Priest could receive the blood of the animal, it was necessary to give him time to do so. Consequently, he only performed the minimal cut, leaving the rest to another priest. (Rambam 4:1, Rashi Yoma 31b).
@b1<EM><EN><*82>82@b2<EN>Ibid. This was the daily burning of incense upon the smaller Golden Altar that is inside the Sanctuary.
@b1<EM><EN><*83>83@b2<EN>After cleaning the Menorah, the High Priest left the Sanctuary and offered the daily morning sacrifice upon the outer Altar.
@b1<EM><EN><*84>84@b2<EN>The white sheet afforded him privacy for his immersion. This immersion, the second, proceeded the change of clothes from the “eight golden garments” to the “white garments.” The white garments were worn for those parts of the service which were special to Yom Kippur.
@b1<EM><EN><*85>85@b2<EN>The first immersion was in a mikvah adjacent to his personal chamber but was not considered to be part of the Temple courtyard, as indeed it was forbidden for him to enter the courtyard until he immersed himself. Subsequent immersions took place in the Parve chamber which was considered part of the courtyard (Rambam 2:3).
@b1<EM><EN><*86>86@b2<EN>It was incumbent upon him to wash before taking off his clothes and then once again after putting on new ones.
@b1<EM><EN><*87>87@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 3:8. The High Priest would sacrifice two oxen on Yom Kippur. One he brought for himself, from his own funds, and one for the Jewish people, from public funds.
@b1<EM><EN><*88>88@b2<EN>The ox stood in the northern sector of the area between the outer Altar and the Sanctuary. It was positioned there in order to minimize the distance the High Priest would have to walk in carrying its blood to the outer Altar.
@b1<EM><EN><*89>89@b2<EN>The head of the ox faced south and its body to the north. The reason it was not placed from east to west was in order that it should not emit waste in the direction of the Altar (Yoma 35b, 36a).
@b1<EM><EN><*90>90@b2<EN>Mishnah 3:8.There is a dispute among commentaries whether the explicit Name was uttered at this point or not.
@b1<EM><EN><*91>91@b2<EN>Our Sages distinguish three forms of sin: a. @hh<HEB>חֵטְא@ee<ENG> unintentional sin b. @hh<HEB>עָווֹן@ee<ENG> intentional sin, [iniquity] that is to say, a sin committed intentionally but material motiovated. c. @hh<HEB>פֶּשַׁע@ee<ENG>—a rebellion, that is to say, an intentionally committed sin without material motive, thus with the sole purpose of defying Hashem (Rashi, Yoma 36b).
@b1<EM><EN><*92>92@b2<EN>The Talmud says that the explicit Name of Hashem was uttered by the High Priest ten times on the Day of Atonement, and each time the people fell to the floor and pronounced “Blessed [is His] Name” etc.
@b1<EM><EN><*93>93@b2<EN>This refers to the Name of Hashem uttered in the pervious verse, ’‘before Adonoy.”
@b1<EM><EN><*94>94@b2<EN>The Mishnah stipulates four categories of similarity: looks (color), height, value, and simultaneous purchase.
@b1<EM><EN><*95>95@b2<EN>Yirmiyahu 31:21.
@b1<EM><EN><*96>96@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 3:9, 4:1.
@b1<EM><EN><*97>97@b2<EN>The High Priest placed both hands into the box, then mixed the lots inside, and lifted them out, one in his right hand and one in his left (Rambam ch. 3).
@b1<EM><EN><*98>98@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 4:1. On one lot was written “For Hashem” and on the other was written “For Azazel.” The two goats stood in front of him facing west. The goat to his right received the lot in his right hand, and the goat on the left was allotted that in his left.
@b1<EM><EN><*99>99@b2<EN>Ibid. This was shouted when he placed the lot “for Adonoy” on the appropriate goat.
@b1<EM><EN><*100>100@b2<EN>They actually responded saying: “Blessed [is His] Name, His glorious Kingdom is forever and ever”; as was the procedure each time the Name of Hashem was explicitly pronounced (see note 92). In addition, as before, the people prostrated themselves (see Rambam ch. 2). The goat receiving the lot “for Hashem” would later be sacrificed as a sin offering, while the goat receiving the lot “for Azazel” would be sent out to the Judean hills.
@b1<EM><EN><*101>101@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 4:2. This was done so that the scapegoat should not be confused with the other goat, to be sacrificed.
@b1<EM><EN><*102>102@b2<EN>Ibid. This was the “gate of Niknor.”
@b1<EM><EN><*103>103@b2<EN>Ibid. This was the ox upon which he had previously confessed his and his household’s sins. Thus, the two confessions were interspersed by the drawing of the lots for the two goats.
@b1<EM><EN><*104>104@b2<EN>This confession was for himself and his fellow priests.
@b1<EM><EN><*105>105@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 4:3. The phraseology “in the usual manner” seems to indicate the opinion of the Peitan, that unlike the morning sacrifice in which only a minimal cut was made, here the High Priest completed the cut. Tiferes Yisroel, in his commentary to the Mishnah, explains that because the slaughter of the ox was part of the special service of Yom Kippur, it was certain that the High Priest would be extra diligent to make sure he received its blood. Other commentaries however (see, e.g. Tosefos Yom Tov to Mishnah 4:3) maintain that the same minimal incision was made for all sacrifices of the day.
@b1<EM><EN><*106>106@b2<EN>Ibid. Since the blood was not sprinkled until later, it was necessary to keep it from coagulating.
@b1<EM><EN><*107>107@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 4:3. The Peitan now describes the burning of incense in the Kodesh HaKodashim, the Holy of Holies, a service which was performed only once a year, on Yom Kippur.
@b1<EM><EN><*108>108@b2<EN>The Talmud, Maseches Yoma (43b) states that the shovel used to stir and carry coals was made of “reddish” gold, similar in color to the blood of an ox.
@b1<EM><EN><*109>109@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 4:4. Since the burning of incense in the Kodesh HaKodashim on Yom Kippur was a totally different procedure than the usual incense burning (even for that very day), the High Priest used a specially designed shovel to facilitate his work. Unlike the usual twice-daily incense service, this special burning required that the High Priest himself stir the coals, and carry them in the shovel into the Sanctuary and finally into the Kodesh HaKodashim. Thus the shovel was made especially light. It had an extra long handle so that the High Priest could rest the handle under his arm as he carried it, taking some of its weight off his hands (see Rambam 2:5).
@b1<EM><EN><*110>110@b2<EN>After taking some coals in the shovel, the High Priest laid the shovel on the floor, temporarily, while he proceeded with the taking of incense. He would later come back, and bring the shovel of coals into the Sanctuary (Rambam ibid.).
@b1<EM><EN><*111>111@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 5:1.
@b1<EM><EN><*112>112@b2<EN>Mishnah 5:1
@b1<EM><EN><*113>113@b2<EN>Ibid.
@b1<EM><EN><*114>114@b2<EN>These curtains separated between the Kodesh, Holy and the Kodesh HaKodashim, Holy of Holies. There was a space of one cubit, between the curtains, through which he walked to gain entrance to the area referred to as “between the poles.”
@b1<EM><EN><*115>115@b2<EN>He placed the shovel between the poles of the Ark. In the Holy of Holies of the first Temple, the Ark containing the Tablets of Law, rested upon the Evan Shesiya, the Foundation Stone. On each side of the Ark there extended a long handle which reached practically until the wall at the entrance to the Holy of Holies. The High Priest, as he entered, would be standing between the two long handles, and would place the shovel upon the Foundation Stone which protruded a bit from under the Ark. Since there was no Ark in the Second Temple, the Peitan describes the High Priest’s location only by correspondence.
@b1<EM><EN><*116>116@b2<EN>After placing the shovel with the coals in the area corresponding to “between the poles,” he heaped the incense upon the coals which caused tremendous smoke.
@b1<EM><EN><*117>117@b2<EN>From the burning incense.
@b1<EM><EN><*118>118@b2<EN>The service of burning the incense in the Holy of Holies was completed.
@b1<EM><EN><*119>119@b2<EN>Carrying the vessel with the blood.
@b1<EM><EN><*120>120@b2<EN>Ibid. Each sprinkling was proceeded by its own dipping (Rambam 3:6).
@b1<EM><EN><*121>121@b2<EN>Ibid. The word @hh<HEB>מַצְלִיף@ee<ENG> indicates the fact that the blood was not sprinkled on the Ark itself but rather on the floor in front of it. The terms “upper” and “lower” refers to the direction of the movement of the hand in sprinkling the blood. The “upper” sprinkling was done by moving the hand up, whereby the blood would rise in an arcwise motion and fall to the floor. The seven “lower” sprinklings were done by a downward movement of the hand; in each case the movement originating at a lower level, with the blood falling straight down to the floor (Rambam 3:5). During the first Bais Hamikdash when there was an Ark, the sprinkling was performed one cubit in front of the Kapores (the Cover of the Ark) (Rambam ibid.). In the Second Temple, the sprinkling was performed in the corresponding area.
@b1<EM><EN><*122>122@b2<EN>Mishnah 5:3. The High Priest counted the sprinklings out loud so as not to make a mistake in the proper numbers (Rambam 3:5).
@b1<EM><EN><*123>123@b2<EN>This was the first (and only “upper” sprinkling).
@b1<EM><EN><*124>124@b2<EN>This was the first “lower” sprinkling. The counting procedure was “one and one” so that he should not count the upper sprinkling as the first lower sprinkling. The six remaining are “lower” sprinklings.
@b1<EM><EN><*125>125@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 5:3. The vessel filled with the remaining blood was placed on a golden stand, specially designated, in the outer Sanctuary. There were two stands in the Sanctuary, one for the vesel of ox blood and one for the vessel of goat blood (Rambam 4:2).
@b1<EM><EN><*126>126@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 5:4. This was the goat that had previously drawn the lot “for Hashem.”
@b1<EM><EN><*127>127@b2<EN>That is to say, in front of where the Ark would be located between its two handles.
@b1<EM><EN><*128>128@b2<EN>The vessel with the remaining blood of the goat.
@b1<EM><EN><*129>129@b2<EN>According to the first opinion in the Mishnah, each vessel had its own designated stand. See Mishnah 5:4.
@b1<EM><EN><*130>130@b2<EN>Ibid. That is to say, he sprinkled one “upper” sprinkling and seven lower sprinklings (Rambam 3:35), and counted them in the same manner.
@b1<EM><EN><*131>131@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 5:4. He poured the blood of the ox into the blood of the goat, then spilled the mixture into an empty vessel so that it should become homogenous (Rambam 4:2).
@b1<EM><EN><*132>132@b2<EN>This was the smaller Altar inside the Sanctuary that was used for the burning of incense. It is called the “Golden Altar” because it was made of gold.
@b1<EM><EN><*133>133@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 6:2. This was the goat which received the lot “for Azazel,” which had been left standing in the courtyard (Rambam 4:2).
@b1<EM><EN><*134>134@b2<EN>The first two confessions were for the sins of the High Priest, his household, and then the entire priestly clan. The third confession was for the sins of the entire nation (Rambam 2:6).
@b1<EM><EN><*135>135@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 6:3. After the confession, the High Priest handed the scapegoat over to someone who would in turn send it to its death. This person was usually another priest although it was not necessary that he be one (See Yoma 66a).
@b1<EM><EN><*136>136@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 6:6. The goat’s bones were broken before it even reached the bottom of the cliff (Yoma 67a, Rambam 3:7).
@b1<EM><EN><*137>137@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 6:7.
@b1<EM><EN><*138>138@b2<EN>These parts include the kidneys, part of the liver and certain fats which were offered on the Altar.
@b1<EM><EN><*139>139@b2<EN>Ibid. The carcasses, their limbs now removed, were placed upon poles and would be carried outside of Yerushalayim where they would be burnt in the “burning house” (Rambam 3:7, 4:2).
@b1<EM><EN><*140>140@b2<EN>Mishnah 7:3. Until now the High Priest had performed the special services for Yom Kippur, and thus wore the appropriate white garments.
@b1<EM><EN><*141>141@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 7:3. In addition to the goat and ox which were burned outside the city, the High Priest brought two “olah” offerings, which were completely consumed upon the Altar. They consisted of two rams, one for himself (meaning that he paid for it) and one for the nation (i.e. that was brought with public funds). The entire sacrificial service of these two rams was performed at this point including the slaughter, the sprinkling of blood upon the outer Altar, the pouring of a wine libation on the Altar, and the burning of the entire animal.
@b1<EM><EN><*142>142@b2<EN>This refers to the fats of the goat and ox which were burnt outside Yerushalayim. The fats are the only parts which are burnt upon the Altar (Rambam 4:2). Though the Peitan only mentions the fats of the goat (which is technically considered a “sin-offering”), the fats of the ox were also burnt at this time.
@b1<EM><EN><*143>143@b2<EN>The Musaf-offering of Yom Kippur consisted of the following animals which are brought specially for Yom Kippur: 1) one ox 2) one ram 3) seven ewes 4) one goat “sin-offering”. The ox and ram of the High Priest are not included in this group.
@b1<EM><EN><*144>144@b2<EN>Ibid. The pan of coals and incense which was earlier placed in the Holy of Holies was now removed.
@b1<EM><EN><*145>145@b2<EN>The white garments were used only once, and then they were put away forever.
@b1<EM><EN><*146>146@b2<EN>Mishnah Yoma 7:4.
@b1<EM><EN><*147>147@b2<EN>Ibid. The daily afternoon sacrifice, the Talmid shel Ben Haarbaim was the last sacrifice offered each day. The incense burned at this point was the second incense burning of the day. The final service of the day consisted of the lighting of the Menorah.
@b1<EM><EN><*148>148@b2<EN>Ibid. After this, the High Priest put on his own clothes, the service of the day now having been completed.

@b1<EM><EN><*152>152@b2<EN>Yoma 67a. The red string was attached to a rock at the opening of the sanctuary as well as to the horns of the scapegoat so that one could see it turn white when the goat was pushed over the jagged cliffs. This was a symbol that the sins of the Jewish nation had been atoned for, and was the cause for rejoicing. (See Mishnah 6:6)

@b1<EM><EN><*189>189@b2<EN>Peace-offerings were a large class of offerings brought not because of sin, but rather as some sort of obligations, e.g. festive sacrifice, or non-obligatory donations. Their distinguishing characterr was that they were eaten by the “owners,” those who brought the sacrifices.
@b1<EM><EN><*190>190@b2<EN>There were two daily sacrifices: one in the morning, and one in the afternoon. These two sacrifices commenced and completed respectively, all other sacrifices brought in the Temple (with the exception of the Pascal Lamb).

@b1<EM><EN><*196>196@b2<EN>Shemos 21:16. In the “Midrash of the ten murdered martyrs” (version III) it is written, “Once Luliano Caesar decided (to study the Torah), he brought ten Sages to interpret the Scriptures for him. He read about the sale of Yosef (by his brothers) and also that if one kidnaps a person, he is put to death.”
@b1<EM><EN><*197>197@b2<EN>In the Midrash (version II), it is stated that he “lined the entire palace with shoes in order that they should recognize for what item Yosef was sold, as it says: “For shoes”: for money to buy shoes (Amos 2:6).
@b1<EM><EN><*198>198@b2<EN>According to the Midrash (version I), first the Sages agreed to judge the case objectively, after which the question was posed.
@b1<EM><EN><*199>199@b2<EN>According to the Midrash (version I), the dialogue proceeds as follows: “If so, then you deserve the death penalty.” They asked “Why?” He answered, “For the sale of Yosef, who was sold by his brothers.”
@b1<EM><EN><*200>200@b2<EN>The source is the verse in Amos (2:6) “For you have sold a righteous man for money, and a pauper for shoes”; the Midrash Pirke De’Rabi Eliezer (38) explains that each brother took two silver coins to buy himself a pair of shoes.
@b1<EM><EN><*201>201@b2<EN>In the Midrash (version III) it is written that Rabbi Yishmael asked the Angel Micha’el, “Hasn’t Hashem found anyone else from whom to take punishment for Yosef other than us?” He answered him “It is your good fortune that Hashem has not found any righteous among the sons of Yaakov but you.”
@b1<EM><EN><*202>202@b2<EN>In the Midrash (version I) it says “Give us three days to find some merit for reprieve; if none is found, do what you want.”
@b1<EM><EN><*203>203@b2<EN>The Midrash (version I) states that they beseeched Rabbi Yishmael to do so. In version II, however, Rabbi Yishmael first volunteered, saying, “If you will agree to share the sin with me, I will mention the explicit Name and ascend to heaven and we will know; if it is decreed from heaven, we will accept it upon ourselves, but if it is not, I will nullify it with the explicit Name.” They answered, “Your sin is divided among us.”
@b1<EM><EN><*204>204@b2<EN>According to the Midrash (version I), “Rabbi Yishmael purified himself with immersion and sanctifications, wrapped himself in his Talis, put on his Tefillin, and then pronounced the explicit Name of Hashem.”
@b1<EM><EN><*205>205@b2<EN>The Midrash (versions II, III) says that immediately thereafter a wind carried him up to the sixth heaven.
@b1<EM><EN><*206>206@b2<EN>According to the first Midrash, this person is identified as the angel, Gavri’el, but in the second and third Midrashim, it refers to Matatron, the “angel of the interior.”
@b1<EM><EN><*207>207@b2<EN>The term “@hh<HEB>פַּרְגוֹד@ee<ENG>” “Pargod” refers to the separation between the sky and Hashem’s Presence, the “Shechina.” (Maseches Berachos 18b).
@sn<EM><EN>According to the Midrash, version II, Matatron told him, “I heard from behind the ‘pargod’ a voice saying, ten of Yisrael’s scholars will be handed over to the emperor. An argument had taken place in Hashem’s Presence, between the angels, Micha’el, and Samo’el. Samo’el said, “Master of the World, You have surely not written one letter in the entire Torah for nothing, and yet it is written ‘if a man kidnaps’ etc.; and the sons of Yaakov have still not been punished for selling Yosef. Immediately Hashem decreed that ten of Yisrael’s sages would be killed.”
@b1<EM><EN><*208>208@b2<EN>In the Midrash (version III): He found his friends fasting and praying. They asked him, “What do you have to tell us?” He answered them “Go, wash yourselves, purify yourselves, and put on your white garments” (referring to garments placed on the deceased) for this has been decreed by Hashem.” When R’ Yishmael told them that they were considered equal to the sons of Yaakov, they rejoiced, and made a feast.
@b1<EM><EN><*209>209@b2<EN>The word “Nasi” used literally means “prince” of Yisrael, referring to the fact that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel was a direct descendant of King Dovid, as well as head of the Jewish High Court.
@b1<EM><EN><*210>210@b2<EN>According to the Midrash (version I), he argued, “I am a High Priest, the son of a High Priest, a direct descendant of Aharon the priest. Let me die first and not see the death of my friend.”
@b1<EM><EN><*211>211@b2<EN>Rabban Shimon argued likewise, “I am a prince, the son of a prince, direct descendant of King Dovid.”
@b1<EM><EN><*212>212@b2<EN>The Midrash (version II) relates, when R’ Yishmael was ordered to bare his neck, he pleaded to be given one minute to cry over his murdered friend. When given permission, he picked up Rabban Shimon’s head, “placed it on his knees, and placed his eyes on its eyes, his face on its face, his nose on its nose, his mouth on its mouth,” and wept bitterly over it.
@b1<EM><EN><*213>213@b2<EN>The Midrash (version II) relates, “It was said on R’ Yishmael the son of Elisha, the High Priest, that he was one of the seven handsomest men that ever lived: Adam, Yaakov, Yosef, Shaul, Avshalom, Rabbi Avahu, and R’ Yishmael. When he was brought to Rome, he was brought before the king, who asked him, “Are there any of your nation who are like you or even more beautiful?” When he answered, “No,” he was immediately condemned to death.
@b1<EM><EN><*214>214@b2<EN>The Midrash (version I) relates that she desired this “in order to use his skin in place of a mirror” (inferring that his skin was so clear, it reflected like a mirror.)
@b1<EM><EN><*215>215@b2<EN>The Midrash (version I) relates that his cry shook the earth and heaven.” When he cried out again, the Glorious Throne of Hashem shook.”
@b1<EM><EN><*216>216@b2<EN> “They asked him, ‘Why haven’t you cried until now?’ He answered, ‘I am not crying over my soul but over the place where the Name of Hashem, Almighty, is placed, on the Tefillin.’”
@b1<EM><EN><*217>217@b2<EN>According to the Midrash (versions I, II) they asked, “Will this righteous man to whom you have revealed all the mysteries of the heavens die such a death?”
@b1<EM><EN><*218>218@b2<EN>In version III, “When the Glorious Throne shook, Hashem was about to destroy the entire world and turn it to chaos; Matatron immediately descended and said to him (R’ Yishmael) ‘If you cry out again, the world will be turned to chaos; how fortunate are you, and your friends, for much is hidden and waiting for you.’ When he heard this, he remained still until his soul left him.” (In version II, it is Gavri’el that descended to R’ Yishmael.)
@b1<EM><EN><*219>219@b2<EN>In Vayikra Raba 19:1, Rav Huna said in the name of Raish Lakish, “The Torah preceded the creation by two thousand years.” The use of the word “Yomayim,” meaning literally “two days” is based on the version in Tehillim 90:4, that a “thousand years in the eyes of Hashem is like one day.”
@b1<EM><EN><*220>220@b2<EN>This is based upon the verse in Tehillim 127:2.
@b1<EM><EN><*221>221@b2<EN>The Talmud Menachos 29b relates as follows: When Moshe ascended to heaven he saw Hashem sitting and placing crowns on top of the Hebrew letters. He said to Him “Master of the World, who is forcing you to add these?” Hashem replied, “There is a man who will live many generations hence, and his name is Akiva ben Yosef. In the future, he will expound upon each of them.”
@b1<EM><EN><*222>222@b2<EN>The Midrash (version I) says that with each laceration, Rabbi Akiva said, “Hashem’s work is perfect, all His ways are just. He is a faithful God and has no imperfections, He is righteous and just.”
@b1<EM><EN><*223>223@b2<EN>As he was brought out to be killed, it was time to recite the Shema. While being lacerated, he accepted upon himself the yoke of Heaven. His students asked him, “Our teacher, even at this point?” He replied, “My sons, all my life I worried about the verse ‘You shall love Adonoy your God with all your heart and all your soul’—even if He takes your soul. And I would wonder, when will the time come for me to fulfill this commandment? Now that the time has come, shouldn’t I fulfill it?” (Midrash version II, Berachos)
@b1<EM><EN><*224>224@b2<EN>It was said about Rabbi Chananya ben Tradyon that he was pleasant in the presence of Hashem and man, and that he never spoke ill of his fellow man. When the Romans decreed that Torah study should cease, Rabbi Chananya gathered together large crowds and taught them Torah in the market places of Rome (Midrash version I)
@b1<EM><EN><*225>225@b2<EN>The Ceasar commanded that he be wrapped in a Torah scroll, then lit the fire.
@b1<EM><EN><*226>226@b2<EN>The officer asked him “Rabbi, if I take away the wet wool to allow you to die more quickly, will you bring me to the World-to-Come?” He answered, “Yes.” The officer then said, “Swear to me on it.” He swore, thereupon the officer increased the fire, removed the wet cotton and he died. Then the officer threw himself into the fire and was burnt. A voice called out from heaven saying, “Rabbi Chananya and the officer are prepared for the world to come.” Rebbe would cry over this incident, and say, “There are those who purchase their world (their share in the world to come) in one moment, such as this officer.”
@b1<EM><EN><*227>227@b2<EN>When sentenced to die, Rabbi Chutzpis was one hundred and thirty years old minus one day, but was very handsome, with a face resembling “an angel of Hashem.” When the Ceasar was asked to spare the life of this old man, he asked him, “How old are you?” He replied, “One hundred thirty less a day, and I beseech you let me live one more day.” The Ceasar asked him “What difference does it make if you die today or tomorrow?”, to which he answered, “So that I will be able to fulfill two more mitzvoth.” “Which mitzvoth would you like to fulfill” asked the king. He answered “To read the Shema in the morning and evening and to accept upon myself the Kingdom of heaven.” (Midrash version I).
@b1<EM><EN><*228>228@b2<EN>It was said of Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua, that he was one hundred five years old, and that from the time he was a young lad until his very last days, no one had ever heard him utter an unnecessary word. He was always humble and lowly, and sat in fasting for eighty years (Midrash version I).
@b1<EM><EN><*229>229@b2<EN>Rabbi Chanina ben Chachinai fasted all his days, from the age of twelve till ninety five. The day he was killed was Shabbos eve. He commenced to sanctify the day and recite the Kiddush, and reached “And Hashem sanctified it (the seventh day).” They did not let him continue further and killed him. A voice called out from heaven “How fortunate are you, Rabbi Chanina ben Chachinai, for you were holy and your soul left in holiness with the word “sanctification.” (Midrash version I).
@b1<EM><EN><*230>230@b2<EN>The Romans, according to the Talmud, are descendant from Esau, whose name was Edom.
@b1<EM><EN><*231>231@b2<EN>They brought out Rabbi Yehuda ben Damah to be executed on the eve of the holiday of Shavuos. He pleaded with the Ceasar, “Give me just a little more time that I may be able to sanctify the holiday and praise Hashem for giving us the Torah.” The Ceasar asked him, “Do you still trust in the Torah and in Hashem who gave it?” He replied, “Yes.” He then asked him, “What is the reward for studying Torah?” to which Rabbi Yehuda replied, “King Dovid said of it, ‘How greatly abundant is the goodness which awaits those who fear You.’” The Ceasar then exclaimed, “There aren’t any idiots in the world like you who believe there is another world.” He then countered, “There aren’t any idiots like yourselves who deny the living Hashem, and it will be your misfortune when you meet us in the next world, for you will dwell at the lowest level of hell.” The Ceasar exploded with anger, and commanded to tie his hair to the tail of a horse, and have him dragged through the streets of Rome, after which he had him cut up limb by limb. But the prophet Eliyahu came and took his limbs and buried them (Midrash version I).
@b1<EM><EN><*232>232@b2<EN>The burnt-offering refers to the @hh<HEB>עוֹלַת הַתָּמִיד@ee<ENG>, the daily communal burnt-offering, while sacrifice refers to the @hh<HEB>מוּסַף@ee<ENG>, the additional offerings of the Festivals.—Iyun Tefiloh
@sn<EM><EN>According to Dover Shalom these two types of offerings can be compared to two kinds of prayers. The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt-offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a @hh<HEB>שְׁלָמִים@ee<ENG>, peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.

@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>It grieved him that the Jewish people would not heed the prophets call for repentance as did the people of Ninveh, and he was upset over the fact that he himself helped bring about this indictment as a result of his mission to Ninveh.
