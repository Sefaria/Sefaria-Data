cannot be included in any prayer or service which requires a quorum. (See Periesha to Tur 
Shulchan Aruch section 619, also Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 324). Special permission is thus 
required in order to include them in our prayers. The above declaration is based on a talmudic 
statement: “Rabbi Shimon Chasidah says: A public fast wherein Jewish transgressors do not 
participate is not a [true] fast.” This is deduced from the fact that though the odor of galbanum is 
unpleasant, Scripture included it among the fragrant spices of the incenseoffering.—Maseches

recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose 
this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on 
behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and 
nights on her behalf, she said, “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, 
since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One 
Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur 
Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last 
words of the verse said by Esther, “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ,” “And so I will go into the king, 
even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from 
sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed 
and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had 
fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king 
was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ” then we 
should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing 
deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages 
ordained that we open the prayers with the word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  recalling the words of Esther; therewith 
shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken 
hearts and tearfilled eyes.\par

of the sequence of the Rosh Hashanah±Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that 
You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by 
“the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and

according to His will. It is only Hashem Himself, He Who originally ordained that law, Who in the 
omnipotence of His will, can also suspend that law. Only He can cause the wrong which was done 
to become as if it had never occurred. Only Hashem can uproot in its entirety the sin and 
consequential effect of sin. He has assured this wondrous power of His benevolent grace to every 
Jew who fulfills the true purpose of Yom Kippur by doing teshuva, true repentance. Thus we cry

“from all your sins before Adonoy, you will be cleansed”; implying that the entire sentence is a 
statement of fact, i.e., that Yom Kippur is a day in which Hashem atones our sins. According to 
Targum Yonassan ben Uziel, however, the words {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'ee\'c4\'eb\'cc\'c9\'ec \'e7\'c7\'e8\'c9\'e0\'fa\'c5\'e9\'eb\'c6\'ed{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  are joined to the previous

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*40>}40{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Yeshaya 6:3. Targum Yonoson paraphrases this verse: “Holy [is Hashem] in the highest 
heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His almighty 
power; holy [is He] forever and for all eternity.” The Talmud, (Maseches Chulin 91b) refers to this 
verse as the “Sanctification of the Angels.” According to Avudraham and Yaavetz, this Kedushah 
has been inserted here to refute those who maintain that Hashem relinquished His control over the 
heavenly bodies, and they are now able to function independently. We are therefore told that all 
the heavenly hosts proclaim Hashem’s sanctification and dominion over all the universe.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*41>}41{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Ofanim, Chayos haKodash, Serafim are various classes of Angels. Ofanim denotes 
animated wheels as conceived in association with the Heavenly throne. (Avudraham); Chayos are 
those angels who exist eternally (Yaavetz; some angels exist only for short times for specific 
functions.) Serafim indicate “beings of fire.”\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*42>}42{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Yechezkel 3:12. According to the Kuzari, Hashem’s glory is a euphemism for Hashem 
Himself. Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: 
Hashem is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view 
set forth in the Kuzari is that “Hashem’s glory” includes the angels, His throne, His chariot, the 
firmament, and the spheres. These are called Hashem’s glory similar to a king’s retinue which is 
his royal splendor.\par

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*44>}44{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Rabbi Pinchos ben Yair was given two measures of barley for safekeeping. The owner 
forgot about it for a number of years. Rabbi Pinchos ben Yair planted the barley seed, and each year 
replanted the previous year’s harvest until it grew to be a substantial crop. After seven years, the 
owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchos told him, “Come I will 
show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” Hashem does the same with the good and 
righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive his 
reward, Hashem returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated dividends. 
Midrash Rabba, Devorim 3:6\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*45>}45{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Since the blessing began with the praise of Hashem as the Former of light Who continually

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*48>}48{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear 
immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they 
perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom 
and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, 
they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—Kuzari\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*49>}49{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The Kuzari writes, “When reciting the blessing ‘Unbounded Love’ {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e0\'c7\'e4\'c2\'e1\'c8\'e4 \'f8\'c7\'e1\'cc\'c8\'e4{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch , one should bear 
in mind that Hashem’s Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it 
as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the 
expression of Hashem’s will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. 
Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become 
worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed 
from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the 
Creator is called love.”\par

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*58>}58{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Devorim 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This 
helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of 
the first word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'f9\'d1\'c0\'ee\'c7\'f2{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  and last letter of {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e0\'c6\'e7\'c8\'e3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  are written larger than the others.

{\highlight7 @sn}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all 
distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on Hashem’s unity. The last word, {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e0\'c6\'e7\'c8\'e3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  “One,” is 
to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that 
Hashem, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the 
unique God of Yisrael, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*59>}59{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah 
departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His 
sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Yisrael” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only 
One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Yaakov said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to 
his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moshe did 
not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Yaakov ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be 
said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a.\par
{\highlight7 @sn}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}When Moshe went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise Hashem by saying, “Blessed 
[is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an 
undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like 
angels, we are permitted to say {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e1\'cc\'c8\'f8\'e5\'cc\'ea\'c0 \'f9\'d1\'c5\'ed{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  aloud.—Midrash Rabba to Devorim\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*60>}60{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Our Sages (Sifrei to Devorim 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your 
desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to 
Hashem’s Law and make them instruments for His service.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*61>}61{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of 
blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was 
tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved Hashem 
with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It 
was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.\par

recited at each Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages 
chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king 
on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and 
nights on her behalf, she said, “ {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, 
since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One 
Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur 
Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last 
words of the verse said by Esther, “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ,” “And so I will go into the king, 
even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from 
sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed 
and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had 
fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king 
was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ” then we 
should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing 
deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages 
ordained that we open the prayers with the word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  recalling the words of Esther; therewith

inside the Holy of Holies and not outside, as the Sadducees contended. The oath was administered 
because there were priests who were suspected of being Sadducees (see Rambam 1:7). They made 
him swear in the Name of Hashem, that he would not change anything of what he was instructed.\par

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*72>}72{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma Ch. 2:3. According to the Talmud, Yoma 24b, the four choosing’s were not 
held at one time because they wanted to summon a crowd four times during the day. It is 
considered an honor to the King to assemble a great multitude in the Temple ({\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e1\'cc\'c0\'f8\'e5\'c9\'e1 \'f2\'c8\'ed \'e4\'c7\'e3\'c0\'f8\'c7\'fa \'ee\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ).\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*73>}73{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The second lot was for picking two priests: one to clean the inner Altar (upon which incense 
was barred), and a second after him to clean five wicks from the Menorah (Yoma 25:1).\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*74>}74{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma Ch. 2:4. The third lot to determine who would burn the incense on the inner 
Altar was drawn just among the new priests who had not yet performed that service. The reason 
for this, explains the Talmud, is that this service increases the wealth of the priest who performed 
it. Therefore, care was taken to give every priest an opportunity to partake of the blessing. It should 
be noted that all commentaries agree that on Yom Kippur, only the High Priest could burn incense 
on the inner Altar.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*75>}75{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma Ch. 3:1. A watchman was stationed on a high place in the courtyard (Tifferes 
Yisroel) to watch for the break of dawn, which signaled the time to proceed with the sacrifice of the 
daily morning offering, i.e. the Tamid Shel Shachar.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*76>}76{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma Ch. 3:4. Before putting on the eight garments, he immersed himself in the 
ritual bath, the Mikvah, since whoever enters the Temple Courtyard (Azarah) is required to 
immerse himself. The opening to the chamber of the mikvah was covered with a linen cloth to 
symbolize the fact that the special Yom Kippur services would be performed in linen clothes.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*77>}77{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Ibid. That is to say, he took off his daily everyday clothes.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*78>}78{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma Ch. 3:4. The High Priest performed his service during the entire year with 
eight garments, four which were worn by regular priests, and four additional ones. On Yom Kippur 
he wore two types of clothing. For those services which were not specially performed for Yom 
Kippur, he wore his usual eight garments. For those services, however, which were performed 
especially in the Holy of Holies for Yom Kippur, he wore only four white garments (shirt, pants, 
belt, and hat). Before commencing service, he wore “everyday” clothes, and put on the eight 
garments of “gold” for the opening service which was the slaughtering of the daily morning 
sacrifice.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*79>}79{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Ibid. It is a positive commandment in the Torah for a priest to wash his hands and feet from 
a special laver. The initial dressing requires only one washing (afterwards), but the subsequent 
changes in clothing require one washing before taking off the initial set of clothes and another when 
dressing in the next set (Rambam 2:2, 4:1).\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*80>}80{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Ibid. The High Priest performed the minimal cut; the major part of each of the two “signs” 
which characterize the slaughter of an animal according to the Torah: the gullet and trachea 
(Rambam 4:1). The reason for this was so that he could quickly receive the blood coming out of the 
neck of the animal. The slaughter was completed by another priest.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*81>}81{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma Ch. 3:4. Since only the High Priest could receive the blood of the animal, it 
was necessary to give him time to do so. Consequently, he only performed the minimal cut, leaving 
the rest to another priest. (Rambam 4:1, Rashi Yoma 31b).\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*82>}82{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Ibid. This was the daily burning of incense upon the smaller Golden Altar that is inside the 
Sanctuary.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*83>}83{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}After cleaning the Menorah, the High Priest left the Sanctuary and offered the daily morning 
sacrifice upon the outer Altar.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*84>}84{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The white sheet afforded him privacy for his immersion. This immersion, the second, 
proceeded the change of clothes from the “eight golden garments” to the “white garments.” The 
white garments were worn for those parts of the service which were special to Yom Kippur.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*85>}85{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The first immersion was in a mikvah adjacent to his personal chamber but was not 
considered to be part of the Temple courtyard, as indeed it was forbidden for him to enter the 
courtyard until he immersed himself. Subsequent immersions took place in the Parve chamber 
which was considered part of the courtyard (Rambam 2:3).\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*86>}86{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}It was incumbent upon him to wash before taking off his clothes and then once again after 
putting on new ones.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*87>}87{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma 3:8. The High Priest would sacrifice two oxen on Yom Kippur. One he 
brought for himself, from his own funds, and one for the Jewish people, from public funds.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*88>}88{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The ox stood in the northern sector of the area between the outer Altar and the Sanctuary. It 
was positioned there in order to minimize the distance the High Priest would have to walk in 
carrying its blood to the outer Altar.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*89>}89{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The head of the ox faced south and its body to the north. The reason it was not placed from

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*97>}97{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The High Priest placed both hands into the box, then mixed the lots inside, and lifted them

and ever”; as was the procedure each time the Name of Hashem was explicitly pronounced (see 
note 92). In addition, as before, the people prostrated themselves (see Rambam ch. 2). The goat 
receiving the lot “for Hashem” would later be sacrificed as a sin offering, while the goat receiving 
the lot “for Azazel” would be sent out to the Judean hills.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*101>}101{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma 4:2. This was done so that the scapegoat should not be confused with the

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*105>}105{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma 4:3. The phraseology “in the usual manner” seems to indicate the opinion 
of the Peitan, that unlike the morning sacrifice in which only a minimal cut was made, here the High 
Priest completed the cut. Tiferes Yisroel, in his commentary to the Mishnah, explains that because 
the slaughter of the ox was part of the special service of Yom Kippur, it was certain that the High 
Priest would be extra diligent to make sure he received its blood. Other commentaries however 
(see, e.g. Tosefos Yom Tov to Mishnah 4:3) maintain that the same minimal incision was made for 
all sacrifices of the day.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*106>}106{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Ibid. Since the blood was not sprinkled until later, it was necessary to keep it from 
coagulating.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*107>}107{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma 4:3. The Peitan now describes the burning of incense in the Kodesh 
HaKodashim, the Holy of Holies, a service which was performed only once a year, on Yom Kippur.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*108>}108{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The Talmud, Maseches Yoma (43b) states that the shovel used to stir and carry coals was

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*109>}109{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Mishnah Yoma 4:4. Since the burning of incense in the Kodesh HaKodashim on Yom 
Kippur was a totally different procedure than the usual incense burning (even for that very day), 
the High Priest used a specially designed shovel to facilitate his work. Unlike the usual twicedaily 
incense service, this special burning required that the High Priest himself stir the coals, and carry 
them in the shovel into the Sanctuary and finally into the Kodesh HaKodashim. Thus the shovel 
was made especially light. It had an extra long handle so that the High Priest could rest the handle 
under his arm as he carried it, taking some of its weight off his hands (see Rambam 2:5).\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*110>}110{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}After taking some coals in the shovel, the High Priest laid the shovel on the floor, 
temporarily, while he proceeded with the taking of incense. He would later come back, and bring

entrance to the area referred to as “between the poles.”\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*115>}115{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}He placed the shovel between the poles of the Ark. In the Holy of Holies of the first Temple, 
the Ark containing the Tablets of Law, rested upon the Evan Shesiya, the Foundation Stone. On 
each side of the Ark there extended a long handle which reached practically until the wall at the 
entrance to the Holy of Holies. The High Priest, as he entered, would be standing between the two 
long handles, and would place the shovel upon the Foundation Stone which protruded a bit from 
under the Ark. Since there was no Ark in the Second Temple, the Peitan describes the High Priest’s 
location only by correspondence.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*116>}116{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}After placing the shovel with the coals in the area corresponding to “between the poles,” he

rather on the floor in front of it. The terms “upper” and “lower” refers to the direction of the 
movement of the hand in sprinkling the blood. The “upper” sprinkling was done by moving the 
hand up, whereby the blood would rise in an arcwise motion and fall to the floor. The seven 
“lower” sprinklings were done by a downward movement of the hand; in each case the movement 
originating at a lower level, with the blood falling straight down to the floor (Rambam 3:5). During 
the first Bais Hamikdash when there was an Ark, the sprinkling was performed one cubit in front 
of the Kapores (the Cover of the Ark) (Rambam ibid.). In the Second Temple, the sprinkling was 
performed in the corresponding area.\par

in the proper numbers (Rambam 3:5).\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*123>}123{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}This was the first (and only “upper” sprinkling).\par

abundant is the goodness which awaits those who fear You.’” The Ceasar then exclaimed, “There 
aren’t any idiots in the world like you who believe there is another world.” He then countered, 
“There aren’t any idiots like yourselves who deny the living Hashem, and it will be your 
misfortune when you meet us in the next world, for you will dwell at the lowest level of hell.” The 
Ceasar exploded with anger, and commanded to tie his hair to the tail of a horse, and have him 
dragged through the streets of Rome, after which he had him cut up limb by limb. But the prophet 
Eliyahu came and took his limbs and buried them (Midrash version I).\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*232>}232{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The burntoffering refers to the {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'f2\'e5\'c9\'ec\'c7\'fa \'e4\'c7\'fa\'cc\'c8\'ee\'c4\'e9\'e3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch , the daily communal burntoffering, while 
sacrifice refers to the {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'ee\'e5\'cc\'f1\'c7\'f3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch , the additional offerings of the Festivals.—Iyun Tefiloh\par
{\highlight7 @sn}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}According to Dover Shalom these two types of offerings can be compared to two kinds of 
prayers. The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered 
entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burntoffering which 
is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of 
Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. 
Their prayer is thus similar to a {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'f9\'d1\'c0\'ec\'c8\'ee\'c4\'e9\'ed{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch , peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, 
the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be 
pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.\par
