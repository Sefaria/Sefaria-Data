<CH1>@b1<EM><EN><*1>1@b2<EN>According to the Talmud, a vow is when one says that such is forbidden to me as is—a @hh<HEB>קָרְבָּן@ee<ENG>, a sacrifice. In place of the word korban, the word konom was frequently used. There is a dispute in Maseches Nedarim as to the origin of the word.
@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>The vow to fast is made at the Mincha service of the day preceding the fast day.
<CH2>@b1<EM><EN><*1>1@b2<EN>“Keeping dishes warm” means that we are permitted to place cooked foods on a covered stove in order to preserve their heat. An example of this is the traditional Cholent.
@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>The Rav of the community usually includes the community in his eiruv. This can be done however by anyone. It is done by handing over the cooked food to another person through whom he grants a share of the food (of the eiruv) to the entire community. This person raises the eiruv a tefach, (handsbreadth) and returns it to the one making the eiruv.
<CH5>@b1<EM><EN><*1>1@b2<EN>Shabbos, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to Hashem. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. These pursuits lead him to serve Hashem and to praise Him.—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>We will proclaim His kindliness in the morning of redemption. And while yet in the darkness of exile we proclaim our belief in His faithfulness.—Rashi

@b1<EM><EN><*18>18@b2<EN>We particularly ask of Him at night to bless us with wise counsel. Daytime is the time for achievement, but the rest that comes with nightfall is made to allow man to compose his thoughts. By virtue of the complete relaxation it affords, sleep endows the mind and spirit with renewed vigor. We pray therefore for Divine aid so that our nightly rest will help us take wise counsel and affirm worthy resolution for future days.—Avudraham and Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*19>19@b2<EN>Shield us from trouble before it comes, and remove it from us if it has already come.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*20>20@b2<EN>The Hebrew word @hh<HEB>שָׂטָן@ee<ENG> (Satan) used in the Prayer Book refers to the Evil Impulse, the lower passions which are a hindrance to man’s pursuit of the nobler aims in life. It is against the dominance of this impulse that the Jew prays. The “adversary,” therefore, is any person, spirit, or Evil Impulse that seduces us to do wrong.—Dover Sholom and others
@b1<EM><EN><*21>21@b2<EN>Shemos 31:16±17. This is merely metaphorical, since Hashem of course does not become tired, nor does He require rest.
@b1<EM><EN><*22>22@b2<EN>The Talmud (Rosh Hashana 8a) relates the word @hh<HEB>כֶּסֶה@ee<ENG> to @hh<HEB>כְּסֹה@ee<ENG>, covering. All the festivals occur when the moon is clearly visible. Rosh Hashana occurs at the beginning of the month when the moon is still covered.

@b1<EM><EN><*24>24@b2<EN>Rabbi Yonasan Eibschitz in his sefer, Yaaros Devash, explains that upon reflecting in Whose presence he is about to pray, man should be so overwhelmed with awe and trepidation that he is unable to open his lips. He therefore prefaces his prayer by beseeching Hashem, to open his lips, asking His help to be able to pray in His Presence.
@b1<EM><EN><*25>25@b2<EN>Because these are days of judgment and our lives hang in the balance, we pray to Hashem to remember us for life (Rashi, Levush).
@b1<EM><EN><*26>26@b2<EN>This is based on Yechezkel 18:32, ‘For I do not desire the death of him that dies, but rather that he repent from his evil ways and live.’
@b1<EM><EN><*27>27@b2<EN>This refers to the Book in which the righteous are inscribed for life everlasting.
@b1<EM><EN><*28>28@b2<EN>We ask Hashem to grant us life for His sake, i.e., so that we can fulfill His commandments.
@b1<EM><EN><*29>29@b2<EN>We proclaim and accept His kingship on Rosh Hashana.
@b1<EM><EN><*30>30@b2<EN>He helps us during the Ten Days of Penitence, by accepting our repentance.
@b1<EM><EN><*31>31@b2<EN>He delivers us on Yom Kippur by forgiving our sins.
@b1<EM><EN><*32>32@b2<EN>Hashem’s rule of the world is permanent and perpetual (Kuzari).
@b1<EM><EN><*33>33@b2<EN>Here we emphatically declare our belief in the immortality of the soul (Kuzari).
@b1<EM><EN><*34>34@b2<EN>Deliverance is not a sudden happening but rather a process of growth or sprouting.
@b1<EM><EN><*35>35@b2<EN>Even if we are not worthy of life by virtue of our deeds, inscribe us for life because You are a merciful Father (Siddur Chasidei Ashkenaz).
@b1<EM><EN><*36>36@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@ee<ENG>, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ@ee<ENG> ‘and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@ee<ENG> recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusiouns of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.
@b1<EM><EN><*37>37@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>תֵּן@ee<ENG> implies @hh<HEB>מַתָּנָה@ee<ENG>, a gift. We ask Hashem to grant us the feeling of reverence for Him, as a gift, knowing how difficult it is to attain such a high level of reverence completely on our own (Siach Yitzchak).
@b1<EM><EN><*38>38@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>מַעֲשֶׂיךָ@ee<ENG>, lit., Your works, indicates that which has attained or is near perfection. Thus Yisrael is called His works since we have accepted His kingship and His Torah which is the fulfillment of Hashem’s creation (Siach Yitzchak).
@b1<EM><EN><*39>39@b2<EN>All you have created, @hh<HEB>שֶׁבָּרָאתָ@ee<ENG>, indicates that which has not attained its fulfillment, thus we ask Hashem to cast His dread even on those people who have not yet accepted His Divine Kingdom (Siach Yitzchak).
@b1<EM><EN><*40>40@b2<EN>The nation of Yisrael will fear You.
@b1<EM><EN><*41>41@b2<EN>The nations of the world will finally prostrate themselves before You, i.e. submit to You and accept the yoke of Your Kingship.
@b1<EM><EN><*42>42@b2<EN>Once all of Your works and created beings have submitted themselves to Your rule and formed a single bond to do Your will, the honor of Yisrael will be established and raised to new heights. It will then be apparent to all that Yisrael alone carried the yoke of Hashem’s kingdom throughout the bitter years of exile, giving Him obedience despite its suffering and persecution and the taunts of those who cynically asked, “Where is Your God” (Etz Yosef).
@b1<EM><EN><*43>43@b2<EN>Those who fear Hashem will then be praiseworthy in the eyes of all men.
@b1<EM><EN><*44>44@b2<EN>Men will no longer consider as ridiculous those who seek Hashem and search for ways to serve Him.
@b1<EM><EN><*45>45@b2<EN>Those who wait upon Him will no longer be subdued but will voice their convictions freely.
@b1<EM><EN><*46>46@b2<EN>See Tehillim 132:17. The climax of this spiritual renaissance will be the restoration of our people to our land under the scepter of the Moshiach, descendant of Dovid, the anointed of Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*47>47@b2<EN>The entire universe was created for the sake of Yisrael in order that Hashem’s Divine Influence be attached to it. This essence (Yisrael) was created for the sake of an even more treasured essence, namely the prophets and the pious among them. This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashana±Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).
@b1<EM><EN><*48>48@b2<EN>Our plea to Hashem is, “let Your rule become evident in all Your glory.” Hashem has reigned supreme at all times; it is only man who, until now, has failed to recognize Hashem’s rule and render Him homage. We now pray that man will at long last come to know Hashem’s eternal, universal sovereignty and pay it the tribute of unreserved obedience (S.R. Hirsch).
@b1<EM><EN><*49>49@b2<EN>According to Avudraham this classification refers to the very wicked who have never fulfilled a commandment, but who nevertheless have breath in their nostrils. Let them also proclaim on the Day of Judgment, that You, God of Yisrael are King!
@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>Even as Hashem Himself is forever true, and even as His word, the Torah and the promise revealed to us are eternally true and unalterable, so too our own service to Him should be true, unswerving and constant. For this purpose we pray for @hh<HEB>טַהֲרַת הַלֵּב@ee<ENG>, purity of heart. We must cleanse and purify our hearts of every passion and impulse that might tempt us to transgress the law or that might stand in the way of our serving Hashem (S.R. Hirsch).
@b1<EM><EN><*51>51@b2<EN>Rav S.R. Hirsch’s translates, “Adonoy is the source of my life’s strength,” thus Dovid declares that Hashem is the fount from which his life derives its power to resist all foes.
@b1<EM><EN><*52>52@b2<EN>Dovid says that he trusts in the declaration stated in the opening verse, “Adonoy is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?”—Rashi, Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*53>53@b2<EN>The literal translation of @hh<HEB>שִׁבְתִּי@ee<ENG> is “my sitting.” The Talmud states that “no man may ‘sit’ in the courtyard of the Temple except for the kings of the House of Dovid.—Maseches Soteh 40b
@b1<EM><EN><*54>54@b2<EN>The Vilna Gaon comments that the commandment of Succos is implied in this verse and the next.
@b1<EM><EN><*55>55@b2<EN>Dovid declares, “Because I look up to Hashem in every aspect of my existence, I am so exalted that no enemy can harm me.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*56>56@b2<EN>This verse alludes to Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. “Hear my voice,” refers to Rosh Hashana when we sound the shofar. The word “my voice (sound)” refers to the “voice” of the shofar. “When I call” refers to Yom Kippur, about which Yeshaya (55:6) said, “call to Him when He is near.”—Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*57>57@b2<EN>Even if I were so depraved that my own mother and father would abandon me to my own devices, Hashem would still gather me up and believe in my ability to mend my ways.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*58>58@b2<EN>His enemies. Dovid asks for Divine help that he be saved even from the mere semblance of wrongdoing so that his foes should not be able to rejoice over his faults.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*59>59@b2<EN>“These false witnesses would have destroyed me had I not believed that I would see the goodness of Hashem in the land of the living.”—Rashi, Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*60>60@b2<EN>There are various interpretations of the “Land of the living.” Some hold that it refers to the present world in which we live—Metsudas Tziyon; Ramban holds that it refers to the World-to- Come; and Malbim says that it refers to Eretz Yisroel.
<CH9>@b1<EM><EN><*1>1@b2<EN>The numerical value of the word @hh<HEB>צִיצִית@ee<ENG> is 600 which, with the 8 threads and 5 knots of the @hh<HEB>צִיצִית@ee<ENG> itself, makes 613, the exact number of the mitzvos of the Torah.

@b1<EM><EN><*11>11@b2<EN>Hashem can also not be compared to the angels.
@b1<EM><EN><*12>12@b2<EN>The word deed is not applied to the wicked man. Since Divine reward and punishment are distributed with kindness, reward is granted to man not only for his deed which may itself be insignificant, but also for the long range effect of that deed. He is punished, however, only for his act of wickedness, not for the consequences of his deed.—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*13>13@b2<EN>The word “blessed” is similar in concept to the words: “merciful” or “gracious” when applied to Hashem. Just as merciful means that He is merciful, the source of mercy; so too, blessed means that He is the source of blessing.—Avudraham
@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>Generally speaking, the name Adonoy is understood as it is pronounced—Adonoy—my Master, and indicates His rule and providence of the universe. When reciting the Shema however, one should bear in mind the written character of the Name which indicates Hashem’s everpresent existence. He was—is—and ever will be.—Vilna Gaon
@b1<EM><EN><*15>15@b2<EN>This may mean either that man was formed by Hashem’s wisdom, or that Hashem formed man and endowed him with wisdom.
@b1<EM><EN><*16>16@b2<EN>In refutation of those who claim that Hashem is not concerned with earthly matters, we declare that even in the presence of His glorious throne, where He is surrounded by myriads of angels, He is aware of the mundane needs of each individual.—Vilna Gaon

@b1<EM><EN><*47>47@b2<EN>If these blessings were intended to increase the population of Avraham’s descendants, it was superfluous, since Hashem had previously blessed him for that purpose. Hashem here blessed the descendants of Avraham with the nobility of spirit and courage to fulfill the command to sanctify Hashem even when self-sacrifice is required. Only the nation of Yisrael, Avraham’s children, were commanded to fulfill this mitzvoh, because of the legacy we inherited from him.—Ha’amek Dovor.
@b1<EM><EN><*48>48@b2<EN>This refers to Hashem’s attribute of stern justice.

@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>Some people conduct themselves in a God-fearing manner in the presence of others (in public), but in the privacy of their homes, do whatever they please. There are others who do just the opposite. In private they are governed by fear of Hashem, but in the presence of others they are too embarrassed or intimidated to be God-fearing. A Jew must always fear Hashem, in private as well as in public.—Si’ach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*51>51@b2<EN>Acknowledging the truth is fundamental to serving Hashem, and to all human behavior. One who is concerned merely with “winning the argument” will go to any extreme to come out on top. This attitude caused the downfall of the 250 leaders who joined Korach, rather than acknowledge the truth of Moshe’ declaration (Bamidbar 16:2±35).—Si’ach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*52>52@b2<EN>It is not sufficient to merely acknowledge the truth verbally but one must speak truth in his heart as well. Rashi on the Talmud (Maseches Makos 24a) cites the following incident as an example of how one should speak truth in his heart: A buyer once offered to purchase an article from Rav Safra while he was reciting the Shema. Because he could not indicate his acceptance, the anxious purchaser increased his offer. Rav Safra refused the increment because in his heart he had already accepted the original offer.

@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>Radak writes that the Hebrew word @hh<HEB>דִלִיתָנִי@ee<ENG> is an expression used to describe either a downtrodden or an uplifted state. The downtrodden state of the Jewish people is actually part of their uplifting says the Sfas Emes, as it is said, “when I was brought low, He delivered me” (Tehillim 116:6). “My downtrodden state was the cause of my salvation,” proclaims Dovid, just as when one lowers a bucket (@hh<HEB>דְלִי@ee<ENG>) into a well in order to bring up the water.
@b1<EM><EN><*3>3@b2<EN>The literal translation of @hh<HEB>זֵכֶר קָדְשׁו@ee<ENG> is His ‘holy remembrance,’ but it refers to His Name; for the titles we bestow upon Him are our means of remembering Him.—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*4>4@b2<EN>A moment is a measure of time. Hashem’s anger is limited to time (be it long or short) but Hashem’s favor is unlimited.—Sfas Emes
@b1<EM><EN><*5>5@b2<EN>The literal translation of @hh<HEB>כָבוד@ee<ENG> is glory. Rabbi Yerucham Levovitz explained that the soul is called @hh<HEB>כָבוד@ee<ENG> because its only function is to give glory to Hashem.

@b1<EM><EN><*15>15@b2<EN>This verse in following the preceding verse indicates that the original covenant which Hashem made with Avraham was later confirmed to Yitzchak in an oath and then established for Yaakov as a statute.

@b1<EM><EN><*16>16@b2<EN>Both Pharaoh and Avimelech were admonished for Avraham’s sake (Bereishis 13:17; 20:3,7).
@b1<EM><EN><*17>17@b2<EN>The Hebrew word @hh<HEB>מְשִׁיחָי@ee<ENG> can also be translated as “My great ones” and as such refers to the Patriarchs. “My prophets” refers to the Matriarchs, who were known to be prophets. Both were afforded extraordinary Divine protection.—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*18>18@b2<EN>Siach Yitzchak maintains that this verse directs Jewry to sing to Hashem in all the lands in which they are dispersed during their exile. Tzelosa d’Avraham understands the verse to direct all the nations of the earth to sing to Hashem.

@b1<EM><EN><*20>20@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>הוד@ee<ENG> (beauty) indicates that which is itself beautiful, while @hh<HEB>הָדָר@ee<ENG> (splendor) is the reflection of beauty. For example: the sun’s light is “beauty” itself while the moon’s light is splendor—a reflection of the sun. (This definition applies only to the Hebrew terms.)—Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*21>21@b2<EN>Etz Yosef understands this as the “holy splendor” of Hashem’s Sanctuary. Tzelosa d’Avraham sees it as the splendor and joy of worship before Hashem, as contrasted with secular, frivolous manifestations of beauty and splendor.
@b1<EM><EN><*22>22@b2<EN>Simcha (rejoicing) describes one’s feelings at a new experience of happiness, whereas gila (exultation) describes the feeling one experiences over an ongoing situation of joy. Since there is nothing new on the earth @hh<HEB>וְאֵין כָּל־חָדָשׁ תַּחַת הַשָּׁמֶשׁ@ee<ENG> (Koheles 1:9), it is said the earth will exult (gila); but the heavens will rejoice (simcha) because there is @hh<HEB>חִידוּשׁ@ee<ENG> in the heavens.—Gaon of Vilna

@b1<EM><EN><*26>26@b2<EN>Mount Moriah upon which the Holy Temple was built is holy itself even when the Temple is destroyed. The previous verse refers to the time of the Temple, the second verse refers to the period of its destruction.—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*27>27@b2<EN>@hh<HEB>חֶסֶד@ee<ENG> (kindness) is the good Hashem bestows without a promise, whereas @hh<HEB>אֱמֶת@ee<ENG> (truth) is the fulfillment of His promise.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*28>28@b2<EN>Hashem’s mercies to mankind started from the very day that Adam was created. Hashem created the world in order to fill it with kindness as it is said: “A world of kindness was built” (Tehillim 89:3).—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*29>29@b2<EN>Attribute your victories to Hashem’s might rather than to your own.—Siach Yitzchak. Rashbam and others hold that since Hashem’s actions are a reflection of Yisrael’s deeds, the latter are, in a sense, the source of His might. Thus when Yisrael follows the wishes of Hashem, they give might to Him.
@b1<EM><EN><*30>30@b2<EN>There is a spiritual Temple in the heavens which corresponds to the Temple on earth.—Radak. The Talmud (Maseches Zevachim 115b) notes that the word @hh<HEB>מִמִּקְדָּשֶׁיךָ@ee<ENG> may also be read @hh<HEB>מִמְקוּדָשֶׁיךָ@ee<ENG>, from Your holy people, indicating that Hashem is especially demanding of the most adherent to the Torah. When this occurs, the world is filled with awe and fear of Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*31>31@b2<EN>These two verses (94:1±2) are an appeal to Hashem during a time fraught with the sufferings of exile, when it seems as if Hashem has forsaken His people. He is urged to reveal Himself as the Mighty champion of justice—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*32>32@b2<EN>Only Hashem knows what is true deliverance for a person. Prayer is not always answered, because Hashem in His infinite wisdom knows that granting the request is not always for our benefit. We must therefore bless and offer thanks to Hashem regardless of whether our petition has been granted.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*33>33@b2<EN>Radak understands Dovid to be asking Hashem to raise the People of Yisrael above their enemies. Ibn Ezra says that Hashem is being asked to act like a shepherd who brings his flock to high ground to save them from beasts of prey.
@b1<EM><EN><*34>34@b2<EN>We hope to earn redemption through our deeds, but if we are found wanting, then “show us Your kindness”—overlook our deficiencies and “grant” us salvation.—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*35>35@b2<EN>Request all that you desire and I will fulfill every request.—Ibn Ezra. The Yerushalayim Talmud (Maseches Taanis 3:6) indicates that the more one requests Hashem’s providence—the “wider he opens his mouth”—the more he shows his belief in Hashem’s ability to provide all of man’s needs.
@b1<EM><EN><*36>36@b2<EN>The foremost level of man’s trust in Hashem is manifested in three situations: a)<TIE>when he is confronted with trouble, b)<TIE>when he seeks help, and c)<TIE>after he has been helped.

@b1<EM><EN><*37>37@b2<EN>@hh<HEB>שָׁמַיִם@ee<ENG>, skies, refers to the heavenly regions beyond earth’s atmosphere, where the stars and planets orbit. @hh<HEB>רָקִיעַ@ee<ENG>, firmament, refers to the earth’s atmosphere where clouds form, and precipitation takes place. The verb @hh<HEB>לְסַפֵּר@ee<ENG> means to recount something which occurred in the past. Thus the stars and planets in the @hh<HEB>שָׁמַיִם@ee<ENG> recount the fact that long ago Hashem created a glorious universe. The @hh<HEB>רָקִיעַ@ee<ENG>, on the other hand, relates that Hashem’s handiwork is evidenced in the constant formation of clouds and in the precipitation of rain. The firmament enables man to recognize the constant renewal of Hashem’s providence.—Malbim

@b1<EM><EN><*71>71@b2<EN>The entire house of Yisrael is urged to bless Hashem Who set us apart from the other nations and made us His people. Yisrael is told to bless Hashem for its own unique position and manner of serving Him.— Ibn Ezra
@b1<EM><EN><*72>72@b2<EN>This refers to those among the nations who converted to Judaism because of their fear and recognition of Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*73>73@b2<EN>This refrain is repeated in all twenty-six verses of the Psalm. We thereby declare that each act of kindliness for which we thank Hashem is not of a temporary nature, lasting merely a day or a year. The effect of His kindliness endures forever, and we continually reap the benefits of every act of Divine kindliness.—Sfas Emes
@b1<EM><EN><*74>74@b2<EN>The sea was divided into twelve parts, so that each tribe crossed on its own route.
@b1<EM><EN><*75>75@b2<EN>The twenty six verses in this psalm symbolize the twenty six generations of man from Creation till the Torah was given. These generations were sustained solely by virtue of Hashem’s kindliness even though they did not have the merit of Torah.
@b1<EM><EN><*76>76@b2<EN>The Talmud (Sanhedrin 37a) states: When a man mints many coins from the same mold, they are all exactly alike, but Hashem formed all of mankind from Adam and no two men look exactly alike. The Sages in Berachos 58a add: just as no two faces are alike, so are no two personalities alike. Thus even though Hashem made them all together, each has his own unique personality.
@b1<EM><EN><*77>77@b2<EN>Shabbos, more than other days, lends itself to offering praise and thanksgiving to Hashem. When man rests from his physical labor and is relieved of material concerns, his soul is free to pursue the intellectual and spiritual aspects of life. These pursuits lead him to serve Hashem and to praise Him.—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*78>78@b2<EN>We will proclaim His kindliness in the morning of redemption. And while yet in the darkness of exile we proclaim our belief in His faithfulness.—Rashi

@b1<EM><EN><*141>141@b2<EN>Tehillim 135:21.
@b1<EM><EN><*142>142@b2<EN>“Alone” means without intermediaries (Malbim); also without the beneficiary’s awareness (Gaon of Vilna).
@b1<EM><EN><*143>143@b2<EN>Tehillim 72:18±19. This verse will be fulfilled in Messianic times when all men will be invested with a true awareness of Hashem’s majesty. The prophet (Yeshaya 11:9) foretells, “For (then) the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of Adonoy as the waters cover the sea.”—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*144>144@b2<EN>Dovid singles out Yaakov because he was the first Patriarch to mention building a house of Hashem (Bereishis 28:22), “Then shall this stone which I have set for a pillar be Hashem’s house.”—Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*145>145@b2<EN>Dovid thus renders unto Hashem the greatness Hashem has given him. His might in war, his victories in battle, and the majesty of his kingdom, are all due to Hashem’s providence.—Iyun T’filah
@b1<EM><EN><*146>146@b2<EN>Divrei Hayamim I 29:10±13.
@b1<EM><EN><*147>147@b2<EN>This is an affirmation of Hashem’s unity: “Adonoy is One.”
@b1<EM><EN><*148>148@b2<EN>This denotes the highest of the seven heavens.
@b1<EM><EN><*149>149@b2<EN>This signifies the sun, moon, and stars.
@b1<EM><EN><*150>150@b2<EN>These are the angelic beings that worship Adonoy.
@b1<EM><EN><*151>151@b2<EN>This was not a mere changing of names. Avraham was elevated and attained new stature as a patriarch by virtue of his new name.
@b1<EM><EN><*152>152@b2<EN>This was demonstrated when he was ready to sacrifice Yitzchak.
@b1<EM><EN><*153>153@b2<EN>In some congregations, @hh<HEB>וְכָרות@ee<ENG> is recited responsively on the day of a circumcision. Consequently, some siddurim indicate that a new paragraph begins here. But it is actually a continuation of the verse.

@b1<EM><EN><*155>155@b2<EN>The miracles and wonders of the Shemos have not and will not be forgotten. Each generation reaffirms its testimony to Hashem’s might against the Egyptians and thus the event remains as vivid and real as though it occurred today.

@b1<EM><EN><*159>159@b2<EN>Even though they had been free a week earlier, they were insecure, fearing that the Egyptians would capture and re-enslave them. Only when Hashem had drowned the Egyptians were the Yisraelites free psychologically.—Seporno
@b1<EM><EN><*160>160@b2<EN>The use of the word “hand” or any physical attribute with regard to Hashem is merely metaphorical, since Hashem is in no way physical.
@b1<EM><EN><*161>161@b2<EN>When people praise a mortal, they often declare undeserved praise. But Hashem is so great that any praise we offer is insufficient.—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*162>162@b2<EN>This translation follows Rashi’s commentary.
@b1<EM><EN><*163>163@b2<EN>This verse is also translated, “You will send forth Your fury: it will consume them like straw.” According to the Zohar it thus refers to the time of the Resurrection, when Hashem will destroy all the wicked.

@b1<EM><EN><*165>165@b2<EN>Seporno and others interpret the verse to read: “They, the mighty, sank like lead in the waters,” “mighty,” referring to the Egyptian officers rather than to the waters.
@b1<EM><EN><*166>166@b2<EN>Hashem is “awesome in praise” for we fear that all our praise will prove inadequate. In truth, it is impossible to praise Hashem fully, and Dovid therefore said (Tehillim 65:2) “For You, silence is praise.”—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*167>167@b2<EN>The Philistines had killed the Ephraimites thirty years earlier when they left Egypt by force. The Philistines were thus gripped with terror when they heard that Yisrael had escaped from Egypt.—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*168>168@b2<EN>Nations on all sides panicked: The Philistines to the west, the Edomites to the south, the Moavites to the east and the Canaanites to the north. The Philistines feared revenge. The Edomites panicked because they feared that Yisrael would now seek revenge for what Esau (Edom) had done to Yaakov. The Moavites, the descendants of Lot, feared they would be punished because of the dispute between Lot and Avraham (Bereishis 13:7). Canaan “melted away” because they realized that Yisrael was destined to take their land, and their astrologers told them that there was no way out.—Rabbainu Bachyah

@b1<EM><EN><*175>175@b2<EN>Tehillim 22:29. The word “king” signifies one whose leadership is accepted freely by all his subjects. Therefore, in reference to Yisrael who willingly accept the Kingship of Hashem, it says, “For the kingship is Adonoy’s.” A “ruler,” however, is one who forcibly rules people, without their consent. Regarding the nations who do not willingly submit to Adonoy’s Kingship, the Psalmist says, “And He rules over nations.”—Gaon of Vilna

@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>Making, @hh<HEB>עושֶׂה@ee<ENG>, is the act of completion, such as when one completes a table by painting it.

@b1<EM><EN><*3>3@b2<EN>The verse in Yeshaya (45:7) on which this blessing is based concludes with the words, “and creates evil.” In His original creation Hashem created the potential for evil, which He constantly limits and controls as the Former and Maker.—Siddur HaGra

@b1<EM><EN><*31>31@b2<EN>This sentence is based on the verse: @hh<HEB>ה' מָלָךְ גֵאוּת לָבֵשׁ@ee<ENG>—Adonoy has begun His reign He has clothed Himself with majesty (Tehillim 93:1).
@b1<EM><EN><*32>32@b2<EN>When man is rested from his everyday tasks and freed from everyday problems, he is able to thank Hashem for all His blessings.
@b1<EM><EN><*33>33@b2<EN>Some render @hh<HEB>צוּרֵנוּ@ee<ENG> “our Rock.” The Gaon of Vilna, however, maintains that it refers to Hashem as our Creator, thus describing Him in the tri-epochal aspect of His Unity: past, present, and future. He was our Creator, He is our King, and He will be our Redeemer.
@b1<EM><EN><*34>34@b2<EN>These are the Jewish People, who are sanctified in body and soul. The word Creator implies a creation of real substance—the Jewish People rather than angels.—Gaon of Vilna

@b1<EM><EN><*40>40@b2<EN>Yeshaya 6:3. Targum Yonoson paraphrases this verse: “Holy [is Hashem] in the highest heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His almighty power; holy [is He] forever and for all eternity.” The Talmud, (Maseches Chulin 91b) refers to this verse as the “Sanctification of the Angels.” According to Avudraham and Yaavetz, this Kedushah has been inserted here to refute those who maintain that Hashem relinquished His control over the heavenly bodies, and they are now able to function independently. We are therefore told that all the heavenly hosts proclaim Hashem’s sanctification and dominion over all the universe.
@b1<EM><EN><*41>41@b2<EN>Yechezkel 3:12. According to the Kuzari, Hashem’s glory is a euphemism for Hashem Himself. Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: Hashem is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view set forth in the Kuzari is that “Hashem’s glory” includes the angels, His throne, His chariot, the firmament, and the spheres. These are called Hashem’s glory similar to a king’s retinue which is his royal splendor.
@b1<EM><EN><*42>42@b2<EN>The angels.
@b1<EM><EN><*43>43@b2<EN>Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair was given two measures of barley for safekeeping. The owner forgot about it for a number of years. Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair planted the barley seed, and each year replanted the previous year’s harvest until it grew to be a substantial crop. After seven years, the owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchas told him, “Come I will show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” Hashem does the same with the good and righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive his reward, Hashem returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated dividends. Midrash Rabba, Devarim 3:6
@b1<EM><EN><*44>44@b2<EN>Since the blessing began with the praise of Hashem as the Former of light Who continually renews the creation, it concludes on the same note.
@b1<EM><EN><*45>45@b2<EN>Tehillim 136:7.
@b1<EM><EN><*46>46@b2<EN>We pray that we will be worthy of enjoying the original light of creation, which Hashem put aside for the righteous in the future world.—Yaavetz
@b1<EM><EN><*47>47@b2<EN>When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—Kuzari
@b1<EM><EN><*48>48@b2<EN>The Kuzari writes, “When reciting the blessing ‘Unbounded Love’ @hh<HEB>אַהֲבָה רַבָּה@ee<ENG>, one should bear in mind that Hashem’s Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of Hashem’s will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called love.”
@b1<EM><EN><*49>49@b2<EN>Hashem bestowed His great and abundant pity on us after we sinned in making the golden calf. He not only pardoned us, but gave us the Second Tablets and ordained the construction of the Tabernacle (Mishkan) for His Divine Presence to dwell among us.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>We preserve the Torah by not forgetting its teachings; we practice the commandments and we fulfill them by making them permanent parts of our lives.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*51>51@b2<EN>Make us single-hearted and undivided in our love and reverence of Your Name. Keep us from distraction of personal thoughts and selfish motives.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*52>52@b2<EN>When one has to receive a favor that is completely undeserved, he feels a sense of shame. We therefore pray to Hashem, that our redemption will not be a “hand out” without merit and cause us to be ashamed. We proclaim that since we “trusted in His Name” and accepted the bitterness of our exile, our deliverance is not totally undeserved.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*53>53@b2<EN>May we return from our exile with our heads held high, not in meekness.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*54>54@b2<EN>Even if we do not deserve to be saved in our own merit, save us anyhow because You perform acts of deliverance.
@b1<EM><EN><*55>55@b2<EN>At the moment Hashem gave the Torah to the Jews at Sinai, we became His chosen people and were brought close to Him for eternity.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*56>56@b2<EN>These final words complete the prayer begun earlier: “Bring us in peace, and lead us upright to our land, so that we may give thanks to You, and proclaim Your Oneness, with love.—Siach Yitzchak 
@b1<EM><EN><*57>57@b2<EN>Devarim 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word @hh<HEB>שְׁמַע@ee<ENG> and last letter of @hh<HEB>אֶחָד@ee<ENG> are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word @hh<HEB>עֵד@ee<ENG> “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to Hashem’s unity.—Avudraham
@b1<EM><EN>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on Hashem’s unity. The last word, @hh<HEB>אֶחָד@ee<ENG> “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that Hashem, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Yisrael, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.
@b1<EM><EN><*58>58@b2<EN>Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Yisrael” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Yaakov said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moshe did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Yaakov ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a.
@b1<EM><EN>When Moshe went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise Hashem by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say @hh<HEB>בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם@ee<ENG> aloud.—Midrash Rabba to Devarim
@b1<EM><EN><*59>59@b2<EN>Our Sages (Sifrei to Devarim 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to Hashem’s Law and make them instruments for His service.
@b1<EM><EN><*60>60@b2<EN>The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved Hashem with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.
@b1<EM><EN><*61>61@b2<EN>The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to Hashem and to Torah might entail.

@b1<EM><EN><*64>64@b2<EN>Devarim 6:5±9. This paragraph contains 10 commandments: 1) accepting the “yoke” of heaven; 2) proclaiming the Unity of Hashem; 3) loving Hashem; 4) studying Torah (and you shall speak of them); 5) teaching your children; 6±7) reciting Shema in the evening and in the morning; 8±9) putting on the tefillin of the hand and head; 10) putting up mezuzos on the door posts.
@b1<EM><EN><*65>65@b2<EN>The service of the heart is prayer, as Dovid said (Tehillim 141:2) “May my prayers be acceptable to You as an incense [service].”
@b1<EM><EN><*66>66@b2<EN>Hashem will make it rain at night so as not to cause you discomfort.—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*67>67@b2<EN>Reward and punishment are here connected with the rainfalls vital to the Land of Yisrael. The heavy rains which open the growing season in the fall and the showers which fall while the grain is ripening are of utmost importance.

@b1<EM><EN><*69>69@b2<EN>No extension will be given. The “generation of the flood” was granted a reprieve of 120 years (Bereishis 6:3) because they did not have from whom to learn; but you do have from whom to learn.—Sifrei, cited by Rashi

@b1<EM><EN><*73>73@b2<EN>Rabbi Yehuda bar Chaviva said that this third section was added to Shema because of six important things contained therein: 1. the commandment of fringes, 2. mention of the Exodus, 3.<TIE>the call to assume the yoke of Hashem’s commandments, 4. the warning against heretical concepts, 5. the warning against straying after sinful desires, and 6. the warning against idolatrous worship.—Maseches Berachos 12b
@b1<EM><EN><*74>74@b2<EN>Rabbi Meir says: “the blue thread of the fringes resembles the sea, the sea reflects the heavens, and heavens resemble the Throne of Glory” (Sifrei). The outward act of looking upon the tzitzis leads the Jew to inward spiritual conformity with the precepts of Hashem.

@b1<EM><EN><*80>80@b2<EN>All that was affirmed above in Shema.
@b1<EM><EN><*81>81@b2<EN>After having affirmed that all that was said in Shema is true, firm, certain, enduring, etc., we take an oath and testify that we accept the “yoke of heaven” upon ourselves as did our fathers before us and as will our children after us, forever and ever. Thus we say in the following prayer: “For our fathers, for us, for our children and for our descendants—Your word is good and lasting—a Law that will never be abrogated.”—Kuzari
@b1<EM><EN><*82>82@b2<EN>The word help indicates that the recipient also participated in his rescue, whereas the words shield and deliverer indicate that the rescue was made without any help from the rescued party. Our fathers who were righteous, participated in their rescue, and Hashem “helped” them. Since we are not that righteous, Hashem shields and delivers us even though we have no merit.—Siach Yitzchak

@b1<EM><EN><*84>84@b2<EN>“Your Torah” means the basic concepts of the Torah itself, and “Your word” refers to ethical concepts, derived from events described in the Torah and by the Prophets.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*85>85@b2<EN>We refer to Hashem as First and Last only in order to preclude the notion that anything existed before Him, and to repudiate the idea that there is an end to His existence. We do not assert that He has a beginning or a fixed term.—Kuzari

@b1@b2<EM><EN>Our faith in the Redeemer of Yisrael Who redeemed us from Egypt, and our hope that He will redeem us from exile, give us the spiritual energy and courage to stand before Him, to pray and beseech Him for our needs, as we proceed to the Amidah.—Yesodos haTefillah
<CH12>@b1<EM><EN><*1>1@b2<EN>Rabbi Yonasan Eibschitz in his sefer, Yaaros Devash, explains that upon reflecting in Whose Presence he is about to pray, man should be so overwhelmed with awe and trepidation that he is unable to open his lips. He therefore prefaces his prayer by beseeching Hashem, to open his lips, asking His help to be able to pray in His Presence.

@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@ee<ENG>, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ@ee<ENG> and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@ee<ENG> recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.
@b1<EM><EN><*15>15@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>תֵּן@ee<ENG> implies @hh<HEB>מַתָּנָה@ee<ENG>, a gift. We ask Hashem to grant us the feeling of reverence for Him, as a gift, knowing how difficult it is to attain such a high level of reverence completely on our own (Siach Yitzchak).
@b1<EM><EN><*16>16@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>מַעֲשֶׂיךָ@ee<ENG>, lit., Your works, indicates that which has attained or is near perfection. Thus Yisrael is called His works since we have accepted His Kingship and His Torah which is the fulfillment of Hashem’s creation (Siach Yitzchak).
@b1<EM><EN><*17>17@b2<EN>All you have created, @hh<HEB>שֶׁבָּרָאתָ@ee<ENG>, indicates that which has not attained its fulfillment, thus we ask Hashem to cast His dread even on those people who have not yet accepted His Divine Kingdom (Siach Yitzchak).
@b1<EM><EN><*18>18@b2<EN>The nation of Yisrael will fear You.
@b1<EM><EN><*19>19@b2<EN>The nations of the world will finally prostrate themselves before You, i.e. submit to You and accept the yoke of Your Kingship.
@b1<EM><EN><*20>20@b2<EN>Once all of Your works and created beings have submitted themselves to Your rule and formed a single bond to do Your will, the honor of Yisrael will be established and raised to new heights. It will then be apparent to all that Yisrael alone carried the yoke of Hashem’s kingdom throughout the bitter years of exile, giving Him obedience despite its suffering and persecution and the taunts of those who cynically asked, “Where is Your God?” (Etz Yosef).
@b1<EM><EN><*21>21@b2<EN>Those who fear Hashem will then be praiseworthy in the eyes of all men.

@b1<EM><EN><*24>24@b2<EN>See Tehillim 132:17. The climax of this spiritual renaissance will be the restoration of our people to our land under the scepter of the Moshiach, descendant of Dovid, the anointed of Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*25>25@b2<EN>The entire universe was created for the sake of Yisrael in order that Hashem’s Divine Influence be attached to it. This essence (Yisrael) was created for the sake of an even more treasured essence, namely the prophets and the pious among them. This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashana±Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).
@b1<EM><EN><*26>26@b2<EN>Our plea to Hashem is, “let Your rule become evident in all Your glory.” For we know that Hashem has reigned supreme at all times; it is only man who, until now, has failed to recognize Hashem’s rule and render Him homage. We now pray that man will at long last come to know Hashem’s eternal, universal sovereignty and pay it the tribute of unreserved obedience (S.R. Hirsch).
@b1<EM><EN><*27>27@b2<EN>According to Avudraham this classification refers to the very wicked who have never fulfilled a commandment, but who nevertheless have breath in their nostrils. Let them also proclaim on the Day of Judgment, that You, God of Yisrael are King!
@b1<EM><EN><*28>28@b2<EN>Even as Hashem Himself is forever true, and even as His word, the Torah and the promise revealed to us are eternally true and unalterable, so too our own service to Him should be true, unswerving and constant.

@b1<EM><EN><*36>36@b2<EN>The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as Hashem’s slaves (Vayikra 25:42), and as His children (Devarim 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King. Contrary to the view that Hashem the Father is so full of love for His children that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that Hashem the King must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to Hashem—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!
@b1<EM><EN><*37>37@b2<EN>Despite our physical banishment and spiritual estrangement—the result of our sins—we still have none other than Hashem to guide our lives and to shape our destiny.
@b1<EM><EN><*38>38@b2<EN>See Yechezkel 36.
@b1<EM><EN><*39>39@b2<EN>Having just asked that our sins be forgiven and that our transgressions be removed from before His eyes, what are we asking for now? Our earlier pleas were for forgiveness of those sins we committed ourselves. But there are sins for which we are held accountable even though we do not commit them ourselves. One possibility is that of watching while others sin when we may have been able to prevent it. (Chazal say @hh<HEB>כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל עֲרֵבִין זֶה לָזֶה@ee<ENG>. A guarantor is one who countersigns a debt note, undertaking to pay if the borrower defaults. Thus we ask Hashem to erase all our notes of obligation whether as borrower or guarantor. In all instances He is the Extender of credit.) Thus we beseech Hashem to erase the records of our guilt in those instances.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*40>40@b2<EN>Many repent out of their fear of Hashem. Others repent out of their love for Him. We beseech Hashem to bring us back in “wholehearted” repentance motivated by love, the most perfect form of penitence.—Etz Yosef
@b1<EM><EN><*41>41@b2<EN>We beseech Hashem to heal both the spiritually ill as well as the physically ill. We ask, therefore, for a “complete” healing for the sick among us.—Etz Yosef
<CH19><CH20>@b1<EM><EN><*1>1@b2<EN>Forming, @hh<HEB>יוצֵר@ee<ENG>, is the act of refining or modifying an original substance, whereas, creating, @hh<HEB>בּורֵא@ee<ENG>, refers to creating the original substance from nothing. For example, when one shapes a wooden table, to make it round, he “forms” the wood, the original substance which was “created.” Similarly, Hashem “forms the light” which is His act of modifying or limiting the darkness He created.—Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>Making, @hh<HEB>עושֶׂה@ee<ENG>, is the act of completion, such as when one completes a table by painting it. Similarly, Hashem’s finishing touch of creation is “making peace,” the vessel that holds it all together, as stated in the Mishnah, “Hashem found no vessel to contain blessing other than peace.” @hh<HEB>לֹא מָצָא הקב"ה כְּלִי מַחְזִיק בְּרָכָה אֶלָא הַשָּׁלום@ee<ENG>— Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*3>3@b2<EN>The verse in Yeshaya (45:7) on which this blessing is based concludes with the words, “and creates evil.” In His original creation Hashem created the potential for evil, which He constantly limits and controls as the Former and Maker.—Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*4>4@b2<EN>Hashem causes light to appear in stages, gradually. This is an act of great compassion for if He made it appear all at once, we would be overwhelmed and blinded by its brightness.— Avudraham
@b1<EM><EN><*5>5@b2<EN>Hashem is not a far-off observer of a mechanism which He created and ignores, but a Living Ruler, Who guides the universe and continually maintains it.
@b1<EM><EN><*6>6@b2<EN>Lit., Your acquisitions: See Bereishis 14:22.
@b1<EM><EN><*7>7@b2<EN>I.e., before Creation. Hashem was King before all creatures were created.
@b1<EM><EN><*8>8@b2<EN>I.e., after Creation. Ever since Creation, Hashem has been praised and glorified by His creatures.

@b1<EM><EN><*10>10@b2<EN>The Heavenly throne is thus conceived of as surrounded by angels and all the adoring heavenly bodies.—See Yeshaya 6:12 
@b1<EM><EN><*11>11@b2<EN>“Holy beings” are angels. In Hebrew the word for angels means messenger, and includes all the instruments of Divine purpose, whether in human form, or in the forces of nature.—Kuzari
@b1<EM><EN><*12>12@b2<EN>A Name of Hashem (Bereishis 17:1; 35:11; 43:14 etc.) which refers to His setting boundaries and limits throughout creation.
@b1<EM><EN><*13>13@b2<EN>Those of His creatures capable of praising Him do so. The rest are evidence of His astonishing wisdom and arouse the others to praise Him.
@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>Some render @hh<HEB>צוּרֵנוּ@ee<ENG> “our Rock.” The Gaon of Vilna, however, maintains that it refers to Hashem as our Creator, thus describing Him in the tri-epochal aspect of His Unity: past, present, and future. He was our Creator, He is our King, and He will be our Redeemer.
@b1<EM><EN><*15>15@b2<EN>These are the Jewish People, who are sanctified in body and soul. The word Creator implies a creation of real substance—the Jewish People rather than angels.—Gaon of Vilna
@b1<EM><EN><*16>16@b2<EN>Beloved—there is no envy, jealousy or rivalry among them. Pure—they have no selfish or ulterior motives; they serve Hashem with all their being.—Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*17>17@b2<EN>Despite the attributes we use to describe Him, He remains holy—beyond our conception.
@b1<EM><EN><*18>18@b2<EN>The yoke of Divine Sovereignty is borne willingly and joyfully by each creature as an emblem of his free service to Hashem.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*19>19@b2<EN>They take care not to precede one another in their praise of Hashem. On the contrary, each says to the other, “You begin, because you are greater and more worthy than I.”—Avos of R’ Nosson
@b1<EM><EN><*20>20@b2<EN>The clear speech of the angels is the holy tongue (pure Hebrew).—Yaavetz
@b1<EM><EN><*21>21@b2<EN>Yeshaya 6:3. Targum Yonoson paraphrases this verse: “Holy [is Hashem] in the highest heights of heaven, the abode of His Divine Presence; holy upon earth, the work of His almighty power; holy [is He] forever and for all eternity.” The Talmud, (Maseches Chulin 91b) refers to this verse as the “Sanctification of the Angels.” According to Avudraham and Yaavetz, this Kedushah has been inserted here to refute those who maintain that Hashem relinquished His control over the heavenly bodies, and they are now able to function independently. We are therefore told that all the heavenly hosts proclaim Hashem’s sanctification and dominion over all the universe.
@b1<EM><EN><*22>22@b2<EN>Yechezkel 3:12. According to the Kuzari, Hashem’s glory is a euphemism for Hashem Himself. Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: Hashem is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another view set forth in the Kuzari is that “Hashem’s glory” includes the angels, His throne, His chariot, the firmament, and the spheres. These are called Hashem’s glory similar to a king’s retinue which is his royal splendor.
@b1<EM><EN><*23>23@b2<EN>The angels.
@b1<EM><EN><*24>24@b2<EN>Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair was given two measures of barley for safekeeping. The owner forgot about it for a number of years. Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair planted the barley seed, and each year replanted the previous year’s harvest until it grew to be a substantial crop. After seven years, the owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchas told him, “Come I will show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” Hashem does the same with the good and righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive his reward, Hashem returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated dividends. Midrash Rabba, Devarim 3:6
@b1<EM><EN><*25>25@b2<EN>Since the blessing began with the praise of Hashem as the Former of light Who continually renews the creation, it concludes on the same note.
@b1<EM><EN><*26>26@b2<EN>Tehillim 136:7.
@b1<EM><EN><*27>27@b2<EN>We pray that we will be worthy of enjoying the original light of creation, which Hashem put aside for the righteous in the future world.—Yaavetz
@b1<EM><EN><*28>28@b2<EN>When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—Kuzari
@b1<EM><EN><*29>29@b2<EN>The Kuzari writes, “When reciting the blessing ‘Unbounded Love’ @hh<HEB>אַהֲבָה רַבָּה@ee<ENG>, one should bear in mind that Hashem’s Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah is the expression of Hashem’s will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with the Creator is called love.”
@b1<EM><EN><*30>30@b2<EN>Hashem bestowed His great and abundant pity on us after we sinned in making the golden calf. He not only pardoned us, but gave us the Second Tablets and ordained the construction of the Tabernacle (Mishkan) for His Divine Presence to dwell among us.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*31>31@b2<EN>We preserve the Torah by not forgetting its teachings; we practice the commandments and we fulfill them by making them permanent parts of our lives.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*32>32@b2<EN>Make us single-hearted and undivided in our love and reverence of Your Name. Keep us from distraction of personal thoughts and selfish motives.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*33>33@b2<EN>When one has to receive a favor that is completely undeserved, he feels a sense of shame. We therefore pray to Hashem, that our redemption will not be “handed out” to us without merit and cause us to be ashamed. We proclaim that since we “trusted in His Name” and accepted the bitterness of our exile our deliverance is not totally undeserved.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*34>34@b2<EN>May we return from our exile with our heads held high, not in meekness.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*35>35@b2<EN>Even if we do not deserve to be saved in our own merit, save us anyhow because You perform acts of deliverance.
@b1<EM><EN><*36>36@b2<EN>At the moment Hashem gave the Torah to the Jews at Sinai, we became His chosen people and were brought close to Him for eternity.—Siach Yitzchak
@b1<EM><EN><*37>37@b2<EN>These final words complete the prayer begun earlier: “Bring us in peace, and lead us upright to our land, so that we may give thanks to You, and proclaim Your Oneness, with love.—Siach Yitzchak 
@b1<EM><EN><*38>38@b2<EN>Devarim 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last letter of the first word @hh<HEB>שְׁמַע@ee<ENG> and last letter of @hh<HEB>אֶחָד@ee<ENG> are written larger than the others. These two letters form the word @hh<HEB>עֵד@ee<ENG>“witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to Hashem’s unity.—Avudraham
@sn<EM><EN>Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on Hashem’s unity. The last word, @hh<HEB>אֶחָד@ee<ENG> “One,” is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that Hashem, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the unique God of Yisrael, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.
@b1<EM><EN><*39>39@b2<EN>Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Yisrael” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Yaakov said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moshe did not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Yaakov ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a.
@sn<EM><EN>When Moshe went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise Hashem by saying, “Blessed [is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like angels, we are permitted to say @hh<HEB>בָּרוּךְ שֵׁם@ee<ENG> aloud.—Midrash Rabba to Devarim
@b1<EM><EN><*40>40@b2<EN>Our Sages (Sifrei to Devarim 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to Hashem’s Law and make them instruments for His service.
@b1<EM><EN><*41>41@b2<EN>The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved Hashem with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their faith.
@b1<EM><EN><*42>42@b2<EN>The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite whatever material sacrifice your loyalty to Hashem and to Torah might entail.
@b1<EM><EN><*43>43@b2<EN>The teachings of the Torah should be ever fresh in your minds, as though you received it today.—Ibid.

@b1<EM><EN><*45>45@b2<EN>Devarim 6:5±9. This paragraph contains 10 commandments: 1) accepting the “yoke” of heaven; 2) proclaiming the Unity of Hashem; 3) loving Hashem; 4) studying Torah (and you shall speak of them); 5) teaching your children; 6±7) reciting Shema in the evening and in the morning; 8±9) putting on the tefillin of the hand and head; 10) putting up mezuzos on the doorposts.
@b1<EM><EN><*46>46@b2<EN>The service of the heart is prayer, as Dovid said (Tehillim 141:2) “May my prayers be acceptable to You as an incense [service].” 
@b1<EM><EN><*47>47@b2<EN>Hashem will make it rain at night so as not to cause you discomfort.—Rashi
@b1<EM><EN><*48>48@b2<EN>Reward and punishment are here connected with the rainfalls vital to the Land of Yisrael. The heavy rains which open the growing season in the fall and the showers which fall while the grain is ripening are of utmost importance.

@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>No extension will be given. The “generation of the flood” was granted a reprieve of 120 years (Bereishis 6:3) because they did not have from whom to learn; but you do have from whom to learn.—Sifrei, cited by Rashi

@b1<EM><EN><*53>53@b2<EN>From the moment your son knows how to talk, begin teaching him the Torah.—Rashi.
@b1<EM><EN><*54>54@b2<EN>Rabbi Yehuda bar Chaviva said that this third section was added to Shema because of six important things contained therein: 1. the commandment of fringes, 2. mention of the Exodus, 3. the call to assume the yoke of Hashem’s commandments, 4. the warning against heretical concepts, 5. the warning against straying after sinful desires, and 6. the warning against idolatrous worship.—Maseches Berachos 12b
@b1<EM><EN><*55>55@b2<EN>Rabbi Meir says: “the blue thread of the fringes resembles the sea, the sea reflects the heavens, and heavens resemble the Throne of Glory” (Sifrei). The outward act of looking upon the tzitzis leads the Jew to inward spiritual conformity with the precepts of Hashem.

@b1<EM><EN><*61>61@b2<EN>All that was affirmed above in Shema.
@b1<EM><EN><*62>62@b2<EN>After having affirmed that all that was said in Shema is true, firm, certain, enduring, etc., we take an oath and testify that we accept the “yoke of heaven” upon ourselves as did our fathers before us and as will our children after us, forever and ever. Thus we say in the following prayer: “For our fathers, for us, for our children and for our descendants—Your word is good and lasting—a Law that will never be abrogated.”—Kuzari
@b1<EM><EN><*63>63@b2<EN>The word help indicates that the recipient also participated in his rescue, whereas the words shield and deliverer indicate that the rescue was made without any help from the rescued party. Our fathers who were righteous, participated in their rescue, and Hashem “helped” them. Since we are not that righteous, Hashem shields and delivers us even though we have no merit.—Siach Yitzchak

@sn<EM><EN>Our faith in the Redeemer of Yisrael Who redeemed us from Egypt, and our hope that He will redeem us from exile, give us the spiritual energy and courage to stand before Him, to pray and beseech Him for our needs, as we proceed to the Amidah.—Yesodos haTefillah
@b1<EM><EN><*74>74@b2<EN>Rabbi Yonasan Eibschitz in his sefer, Yaaros Devash, explains that upon reflecting in Whose Presence he is about to pray, man should be so overwhelmed with awe and trepidation that he is unable to open his lips.

@b1<EM><EN><*87>87@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@ee<ENG>, ‘and so,’ marks the beginning of the special prayers of the Shemoneh Esreh recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and nights on her behalf, she said, “ @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ@ee<ENG> and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last words of the verse said by Esther, “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>,” “And so I will go into the king, even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “@hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן אָבוֹא אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲשֶׁר לֹא כַדָּת@ee<ENG>” then we should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages ordained that we open the prayers with the word @hh<HEB>וּבְכֵן@ee<ENG> recalling the words of Esther; therewith shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken hearts and tear-filled eyes.
@b1<EM><EN><*88>88@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>תֵּן@hh@ee<ENG> implies @hh<HEB>מַתָּנָה@hh@ee<ENG>, a gift. We ask Hashem to grant us the feeling of reverence for Him, as a gift, knowing how difficult it is to attain such a high level of reverence completely on our own (Siach Yitzchak).
@b1<EM><EN><*89>89@b2<EN>The word @hh<HEB>מַעֲשֶׂיךָ@hh@ee<ENG>, lit., Your works, indicates that which has attained or is near perfection. Thus Yisrael is called His works since we have accepted His Kingship and His Torah which is the fulfillment of Hashem’s creation (Siach Yitzchak).
@b1<EM><EN><*90>90@b2<EN>All you have created, @hh<HEB>שֶׁבָּרָאתָ@hh@ee<ENG>, indicates that which has not attained its fulfillment, thus we ask Hashem to cast His dread even on those people who have not yet accepted His Divine Kingdom (Siach Yitzchak).
@b1<EM><EN><*91>91@b2<EN>The nation of Yisrael will fear You.
@b1<EM><EN><*92>92@b2<EN>The nations of the world will finally prostrate themselves before You, i.e. submit to You and accept the yoke of Your Kingship.
@b1<EM><EN><*93>93@b2<EN>Once all of Your works and created beings have submitted themselves to Your rule and formed a single bond to do Your will, the honor of Yisrael will be established and raised to new heights. It will then be apparent to all that Yisrael alone carried the yoke of Hashem’s kingdom throughout the bitter years of exile, giving Him obedience despite its suffering and persecution and the taunts of those who cynically asked, “Where is Your God?” (Etz Yosef).
@b1<EM><EN><*94>94@b2<EN>Those who fear Hashem will then be praiseworthy in the eyes of all men.
@b1<EM><EN><*95>95@b2<EN>Men will no longer consider as ridiculous those who seek Hashem and search for ways to serve Him.
@b1<EM><EN><*96>96@b2<EN>Those who wait upon Him will no longer be subdued but will voice their convictions freely.
@b1<EM><EN><*97>97@b2<EN>See Tehillim 132:17. The climax of this spiritual renaissance will be the restoration of our people to our land under the scepter of the Moshiach, descendant of Dovid, the anointed of Hashem.
@b1<EM><EN><*98>98@b2<EN>The entire universe was created for the sake of Yisrael in order that Hashem’s Divine Influence be attached to it. This essence (Yisrael) was created for the sake of an even more treasured essence, namely the prophets and the pious among them. This gradation forms the basis of the sequence of the Rosh Hashana±Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of Kuzari, page 59).
@b1<EM><EN><*99>99@b2<EN>Our plea to Hashem is, “let Your rule become evident in all Your glory.” For we know that Hashem has reigned supreme at all times; it is only man who, until now, has failed to recognize Hashem’s rule and render Him homage. We now pray that man will at long last come to know Hashem’s eternal, universal sovereignty and pay it the tribute of unreserved obedience (S.R. Hirsch).
@b1<EM><EN><*100>100@b2<EN>According to Avudraham this classification refers to the very wicked who have never fulfilled a commandment, but who nevertheless have breath in their nostrils. Let them also proclaim on the Day of Judgment, that You, Hashem of Yisrael are King!
@b1<EM><EN><*101>101@b2<EN>Even as Hashem Himself is forever true, and even as His word, the Torah and the promise revealed to us are eternally true and unalterable, so too our own service to Him should be true, unswerving and constant. For this purpose we pray for @hh<HEB>טַהֲרַת הַלֵּב@hh@ee<ENG>, purity of heart. We must cleanse and purify our hearts of every passion and impulse that might tempt us to transgress the law or that might stand in the way of our serving Hashem (S.R. Hirsch).

@b1<EM><EN><*21>21@b2<EN>The Jewish People are referred to in Scripture as Hashem’s slaves (Vayikra 25:42), and as His children (Devarim 14:1). Thus we say to Him, “If we are Your children, we beseech You as our Father; if we are Your slaves, we implore You as our Master and King. Contrary to the view that Hashem the Father is so full of love for His children that He permits the wanton breaking of His commandments to go unpunished, Judaism knows that Hashem the King must be feared and His laws must be obeyed. There are times when a father is unable to do what he would like for his children because of physical or financial limitations. On the other hand, a king has the power to do anything for his subjects if he should so desire. We cry out to Hashem—You are our Father and You desire to help us—You are our King and You have the power to help us!

@b1<EM><EN><*24>24@b2<EN>Having just asked that our sins be forgiven and that our transgressions be removed from before His eyes, what are we asking for now? Our earlier pleas were for forgiveness of those sins we committed ourselves. But there are sins for which we are held accountable even though we do not commit them ourselves. One possibility is that of watching while others sin when we may have been able to prevent it. (Chazal say @hh<HEB>כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל עֲרֵבִין זֶה לָזֶה@hh@ee<ENG>. A guarantor is one who countersigns a debt note, undertaking to pay if the borrower defaults. Thus we ask Hashem to erase all our notes of obligation whether as borrower or guarantor.

@b1<EM><EN><*25>25@b2<EN>Many repent out of their fear of Hashem. Others repent out of their love for Him. We beseech Hashem to bring us back in “wholehearted” repentance motivated by love, the most perfect form of penitence.—Etz Yosef

@b1<EM><EN><*9>9@b2<EN>According to some, Sarah saw Yishmael commit three of the worst possible sins, adultery, idolatry, and murder. A very different opinion is expressed by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai who said, “Heaven forbid that such sins would have been committed in Avraham’s house.” (Yishmael was fourteen years old at the time.) He maintains that Yishmael’s mockery consisted of his claiming the premier right of inheritance over Yitzchak.
@b1<EM><EN><*10>10@b2<EN>It was very difficult for him to drive Yishmael away from his house. Avraham was kind-hearted to all; even more so to his own flesh and blood. Having to drive away his son was the worst thing that every happened to Avraham (Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer).
@b1<EM><EN><*11>11@b2<EN>Although Avraham had given them sufficient food and water to reach their destination, Yishmael contracted an illness, and suffering from fever, he consumed all the water (Rashi).
@b1<EM><EN><*12>12@b2<EN>According to Targum Yonassan, Hashem had compassion on Yishmael, and heard his voice because of Avraham’s merit. Others say that Yishmael also had merit, since he allowed his father to circumcise him when he was a grown lad of thirteen years.
@b1<EM><EN><*13>13@b2<EN>As Hashem was about to spare Yishmael, certain angels argued that he did not deserve miraculous intervention because of the following event that was to occur in the future: When Nebuchadnezzar drove the Jews from Yerushalayim to Babylonia, eighty thousand young kohanim, (priests) fled to the Yishmaelites. They said, “We are brothers, all we ask is some water to quench our thirst. The Yishmaelites first gave them generous helpings of salt fish, saying that it was not good to drink on an empty stomach. Since they were nearly starving, they ate the fish, which made them all the more thirsty. When they asked for water, the Yishmaelites gave them skins filled with air. When they took them to their lips, the pressure exploded their stomachs, killing many of them.
@sn<EM><EN>The angels said, “The descendants of Yishmael are destined to do such a wicked thing to Your children, killing them with thirst. How can You now save Yishmael, since he himself is also wicked? “I know,” replied the Almighty, “but I judge a person only according to what he is now, and at this point in time, Yishmael doesn’t deserve to die of thirst. See Rashi, Targum Yonassan.
@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>According to some commentaries, the word @hh<HEB>אֵשֶׁל@ee<ENG> is an abbreviation of @hh<HEB>אַכִילָה@ee<ENG> (food), @hh<HEB>שְׁתִיָה@ee<ENG> (drink) and @hh<HEB>לְוִיָה@ee<ENG> (escort), which were part of the generous hospitality provided by Avraham.
@b1<EM><EN><*15>15@b2<EN>The true prophet must be genuinely tov “good” and a friend to all men both in his attitude and in his conduct.

The Jewish prophet stands in the service of tov of the kingdom of the absolute good whose messanger he is meant to be.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*16>16@b2<EN>The prophet is given only the basic content of the ideals which he is to proclaim. The words in which he expresses the theme communicated to him however, are his own. According to the Sages @hh<HEB>אֵין שְׁנֵי נְבִיאִים מִתְנַבְּאִין בְּסִגְנו‍ֹן אֶחָד@ee<ENG>, each prophet has a style, peculiar to him alone, hence a prophet requires the gift of eloquence.

When the Jew hears the broken notes of the teruah, he realizes that he deserves shattering punishment for his transgressions and is inspired to teshuvah, true repentance. His sins are forgiven and this forgiveness is symbolized in the ascendance of Hashem from His Throne of Strict Justice (Elokim) to sit on His Throne of Mercy. Thus Hashem ascends because of the teruah sound of the shofar.

@b1<EM><EN><*6>6@b2<EN>The Divine inspiration of Hashem, Who is One, the Unity par excellence, can only be experienced by an entity, united, in a single cause.

Thus we are referred to as @hh<HEB>גוֹי אֶחָד בָּאָרֶץ@ee<ENG> one nation in the land, and as such, we are capable of receiving and retaining the Divine influence. The nations of the world however are many, and the diversity within each nation is great. In their present status they are incapable of experiencing the Divine inspiration. We pray, therefore, for the time when they will attach themselves to the nation of Yisrael, and recognize the superiority of our moral and spiritual values.

@b1<EM><EN><*27>27@b2<EN>Bamidbar 23:21. These words were uttered by Bilaam when he was asked to curse the nation of Yisrael. He realized that Yisrael was a unique nation in the eyes of Hashem, their King, and thus were invulnerable to his curses.
@b1<EM><EN><*28>28@b2<EN>Devarim 33:5. Rashi says that Hashem was King of Yisrael only when the tribes of Yisrael were united. When there is unity and harmony among Jews, the kingdom of Hashem is revealed and enhanced.
@b1<EM><EN><*29>29@b2<EN>Tehillim 22:29. The word king signifies one whose leadership is accepted willingly by his people. In referring to the nation of Yisrael which willingly accepted the kingship of Hashem, the Psalmist says, “For the kingship is Adonoy’s.” A ruler, however, might be one who imposes his rule without consent of the people. Therefore, regarding the other nations who do not willingly submit to His Kingship, a Psalmist says, “And He rules over nations.”—Gaon of Vilna

@b1<EM><EN><*31>31@b2<EN>The words @hh<HEB>וּשְׂאוּ פִּתְחֵי עו‍ֹלָם@ee<ENG>, “and lift up entranceways to eternity,” imply that the gates of the Temple will lift up voluntarily, whereas the earlier words @hh<HEB>וְהִנָשְׂאוּ פִתְחֵי עו‍ֹלָם@ee<ENG>, “and be uplifted entranceways to eternity” suggests that the gates must be uplifted against their will. The Siach Yitzchak quoting Malbim explains that initially Hashem was referred to as the King of Glory because He appeared as strong and mighty in battle, forcing the wicked to bend to His will. Therefore, the gates do not open willingly to permit the glory of Hashem to enter, and must be opened by force. Ultimately, however, the world will be so spiritually saturated that it will recognize Hashem’s greatness as the Creator of all. The gates will open by themselves to welcome Hashem, not as One mighty in vengeance but as the masterful Creator of the world.

@b1<EM><EN><*53>53@b2<EN>According to Malbim “the kindness of your youth” refers to the kindness of our forefathers who accepted the Oneness of Hashem and proclaimed His Kingship to a world steeped in the worship of idols. Metsudas Dovid maintains however that “the kindness of your youth” refers to the kindness Hashem bestowed on us at the early stage of our history, when He selected Yisrael as His special, unique people.
@b1<EM><EN><*54>54@b2<EN>This refers to the love Hashem bestowed on Yisrael when He gave us the Torah at Sinai. Our Sages refer to this event as the canopy, the chupah, by which the children of Yisrael were betrothed to Him.—Malbim, Metsudas Dovid

@b1<EM><EN><*58>58@b2<EN>These words must be understood in the context of the two sentences (Yirmiyahu 31:17±18) preceding them. I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself, saying: “You have chastised me and I was chastised .<TIE>.<TIE>. I was ashamed, I was also disgraced, because I bear the humiliation of the sins of my youth.” Thus, explains Rabbenu Shlomo of Germaza, when Hashem hears Ephraim’s words of repentance, He is moved to proclaim His Divine love for him and to recall His delight in him. Ephraim is the name by which the ten tribes of Yisrael was referred.

@sn<EM><EN>According to Dover Shalom these two types of offerings can be compared to two kinds of prayers. The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt- offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a @hh<HEB>שְׁלָמִים@ee<ENG>, peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.

The nation of Yisrael, though composed of individuals, is nevertheless a unit, bound by its singular belief in Hashem and Torah. Thus we are referred to as @hh<HEB>גוֹי אֶחָד בָּאָרֶץ@ee<ENG> one nation in the land, and as such, we are capable of receiving and retaining the Divine influence. The nations of the world however are many, and the diversity within each nation is great. In their present status they are incapable of experiencing the Divine inspiration. We pray, therefore, for the time when they will attach themselves to the nation of Yisrael, and recognize the superiority of our moral and spiritual values. Then, they will attain a level of unity and be capable of receiving a degree of Divine enlightenment. This is the intent of our prayer, “and may they all form a single band.”—R’ Moshe Chaim Luzzato, Ibid.
@b1<EM><EN><*7>7@b2<EN>Those who understand and recognize the mysterious ways in which Hashem rules the world, realize that despite superficial events that seem to indicate otherwise, Hashem’s rule is indisputable and all powerful. Thus we declare our firm belief in His rulership and His strength.—R’ Moshe Chaim Luzzato, Ibid
@b1<EM><EN><*8>8@b2<EN>Despite our status as a chosen and holy people, only when the entire world reaches its ultimate perfection, will we achieve our ultimate goal. Thus only after Hashem’s kingdom is revealed in the world, and good triumphs over evil, will we reach our maximum potential and thereby bask in His glory. This is our prayer, “grant honor, Almighty, to Your people.”—R. Moshe Chaim Luzzato, Ibid.
@b1<EM><EN><*9>9@b2<EN>The only setting for this glorious fulfillment is in the Holy Land—there in the chosen land, will the chosen people experience its true spiritual fulfillment, under the leadership of the king, a descendant of the chosen house of royalty, the house of Dovid.

@b1<EM><EN><*14>14@b2<EN>The terms, injustice, all wickedness and rule of evil refer to Amalek, the archenemy of the Jewish people and of Hashem. Its name and memory will ultimately be obliterated from the earth.—R’ Moshe Chaim Luzzato

@b1<EM><EN><*23>23@b2<EN>In the Torah, (Vayikra 23:24) Rosh Hashana is described with the words @hh<HEB>יִהְיֶה לָכֶם שַׁבָּתו‍ֹן זִכְרו‍ֹן תְּרוּעָה@ee<ENG>. We are thus taught that it is both a day of @hh<HEB>זִכָּרו‍ֹן@ee<ENG>, remembrance, and @hh<HEB>תְּרוּעָה@ee<ENG>, a day of sounding the teruah. Rav S.R. Hirsch writes that both terms are addressed to us. We are told that we must stop and thoughtfully reexamine the paths we have followed, just as our Creator remembers us, and examines our past conduct. With the blast of the shofar we are summoned to break with our past errors and to abandon everything in our lives that does not meet with Hashem’s favor.

@b1<EM><EN><*26>26@b2<EN>Bamidbar 23:21. These words were uttered by Bilaam when he was asked to curse the nation of Yisrael. He realized that Yisrael was a unique nation in the eyes of Hashem, their King, and thus were invulnerable to his curses.
@b1<EM><EN><*27>27@b2<EN>Devarim 33:5. Rashi says that Hashem was King of Yisrael only when the tribes of Yisrael were united. When there is unity and harmony among Jews, the kingdom of Hashem is revealed and enhanced.
@b1<EM><EN><*28>28@b2<EN>Tehillim 22:29. The word king signifies one whose leadership is accepted willingly by his people. In referring to the nation of Yisrael which willingly accepted the kingship of Hashem, the Psalmist says, “For the kingship is Adonoy’s.” A ruler, however, might be one who imposes his rule without consent of the people. Therefore, regarding the other nations who do not willingly submit to His Kingship, a Psalmist says, “And He rules over nations.”—Gaon of Vilna
@b1<EM><EN><*29>29@b2<EN>Tehillim 93:1.
@b1<EM><EN><*30>30@b2<EN>The words @hh<HEB>וּשְׂאוּ פִּתְחֵי עו‍ֹלָם@ee<ENG>, “and lift up entranceways to eternity,” imply that the gates of the Temple will lift up voluntarily, whereas the earlier words @hh<HEB>וְהִנָשְׂאוּ פִתְחֵי עו‍ֹלָם@ee<ENG>, “and be uplifted entranceways to eternity” suggests that the gates must be uplifted against their will. The Siach Yitzchak quoting Malbim explains that initially Hashem was referred to as the King of Glory because He appeared as strong and mighty in battle, forcing the wicked to bend to His will. Therefore, the gates do not open willingly to permit the glory of Hashem to enter, and must be opened by force. Ultimately, however, the world will be so spiritually saturated that it will recognize Hashem’s greatness as the Creator of all. The gates will open by themselves to welcome Hashem, not as One mighty in vengeance but as the masterful Creator of the world.

@b1<EM><EN><*52>52@b2<EN>According to Malbim “the kindness of your youth” refers to the kindness of our forefathers who accepted the Oneness of Hashem and proclaimed His Kingship to a world steeped in the worship of idols. Metsudas Dovid maintains however that “the kindness of your youth” refers to the kindness Hashem bestowed on us at the early stage of our history, when He selected Yisrael as His special, unique people.
@b1<EM><EN><*53>53@b2<EN>This refers to the love Hashem bestowed on Yisrael when He gave us the Torah at Sinai. Our Sages refer to this event as the canopy, the chupah, by which the children of Yisrael were betrothed to Him.—Malbim, Metsudas Dovid

I was ashamed, I was also disgraced, because I bear the humiliation of the sins of my youth.” Thus, explains Rabbenu Shlomo of Germaza, when Hashem hears Ephraim’s words of repentance, He is moved to proclaim His Divine love for him and to recall His delight in him. Ephraim is the name by which the ten tribes of Yisrael was referred.

@sn<EM><EN>According to Dover Shalom these two types of offerings can be compared to two kinds of prayers. The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt- offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a @hh<HEB>שְׁלָמִים@ee<ENG>, peace offering, of which only part is consumed on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.

@b1<EM><EN><*41>41@b2<EN>On the sixth day, the Levites sang psalm 93, “Adonoy is King, He has clothed Himself in majesty,” because He completed the work of creating and reigned over all His creatures.—Maseches Rosh Hashana 31a
@b1<EM><EN><*42>42@b2<EN>Rav S.R. Hirsch’s translates, “Adonoy is the source of my life’s strength,” thus Dovid declares that Hashem is the fount from which his life derives its power to resist all foes.
@b1<EM><EN><*43>43@b2<EN>Dovid says that he trusts in the declaration stated in the opening verse, “Adonoy is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?”—Rashi, Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*44>44@b2<EN>The literal translation of @hh<HEB>שִׁבְתִּי@ee<ENG> is “my sitting.” The Talmud states that “no man may ‘sit’ in the courtyard of the Temple except for the kings of the House of Dovid.—Maseches Soteh 40b
@b1<EM><EN><*45>45@b2<EN>The Vilna Gaon comments that the commandment of Succos is implied in this verse and the next.
@b1<EM><EN><*46>46@b2<EN>Dovid declares, “Because I look up to Hashem in every aspect of my existence, I am so exalted that no enemy can harm me.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*47>47@b2<EN>This verse alludes to Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur. “Hear my voice,” refers to Rosh Hashana when we sound the shofar. The word “my voice (sound)” refers to the “voice” of the shofar. “When I call” refers to Yom Kippur, about which Yeshaya (55:6) said, “call to Him when He is near.”—Siddur HaGra
@b1<EM><EN><*48>48@b2<EN>Even if I were so depraved that my own mother and father would abandon me to my own devices, Hashem would still gather me up and believe in my ability to mend my ways.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*49>49@b2<EN>His enemies. Dovid asks for Divine help that he be saved even from the mere semblance of wrongdoing so that his foes should not be able to rejoice over his faults.—S.R. Hirsch
@b1<EM><EN><*50>50@b2<EN>“These false witnesses would have destroyed me had I not believed that I would see the goodness of Hashem in the land of the living.”—Rashi, Radak
@b1<EM><EN><*51>51@b2<EN>There are various interpretations of the “Land of the living.” Some hold that it refers to the present world in which we live—Metsudas Tziyon; Ramban holds that it refers to the World-to- Come; and Malbim says that it refers to Eretz Yisroel.
<CH18>@b1<EM><EN><*1>1@b2<EN>Hashem waits to hear the praises of Yisrael before He listens to the praises of the angels.—Etz Yosef
@sn<EM><EN>Hashem waits until the very last congregation of Jews has completed its prayers and then accepts the prayers of all Yisrael at one time.—Avudraham
@b1<EM><EN><*2>2@b2<EN>According to the Targum interpretation, the thrice “holy” in the Kedushah does not indicate three ascending degrees of sanctification. Instead its implies a declaration that He Who is holy in the loftiest regions of His heavenly abode is holy not only there but also on earth, the creation of His Almighty power; and that He was not only holy in the past, but that He is holy even now and will be holy throughout all the ages.—S.R. Hirsch

@b1<EM><EN><*12>12@b2<EN>The patriarchs symbolize the three pillars of the universe—Torah, avodah,—the Temple service and gemilas chasadim—kindliness. Yaakov epitomized Torah, which is the ultimate truth; Yitzchak personified Divine service in his readiness to be offered as a sacrifice to Hashem; and Avraham exemplified the ideal and practice of kindliness throughout his life. We thus pray to be granted a share in the Divine truth of Torah in Yaakov’s merit, and to receive Hashem’s kindliness in Avraham’s merit.

@b1<EM><EN><*19>19@b2<EN>This phrase is based on Yeshaya 43:7 “Everything that is called by My Name, I have created it for My glory.”
@b1<EM><EN><*20>20@b2<EN>This prayer is based on Yehoshua 24:2, 3, “Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the river—and they served other gods. And I took your father Avraham from the other side of the river.” See Bereishis 20:13 as interpreted by Onkelos.
@b1<EM><EN><*21>21@b2<EN>Some women are barren; they cannot bear children at all. Others have children who are unable to live. Similarly, there are those who study Torah only to criticize and ridicule what they learn, while others learn sincerely but later rebel against its teachings. Those who study to ridicule are comparable to the barren women who are unable to give birth. But those who later rebel are like those who bear children and bury them. We pray to Hashem to instill His love and fear in our hearts so that our learning will bear fruit and have a lasting influence on our lives.—Siddur HaGra

@b1<EM><EN><*23>23@b2<EN>He does not just put his trust in Hashem while relying also upon a great many other factors which he considers the essential supports of his life and happiness. Hashem alone is the source of his trust; he relies on none other than Hashem.—S.R. Hirsch
