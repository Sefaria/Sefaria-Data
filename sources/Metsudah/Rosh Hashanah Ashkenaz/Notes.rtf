recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose 
this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on 
behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and 
nights on her behalf, she said, “ {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  ‘and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, 
since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One 
Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur 
Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last 
words of the verse said by Esther, “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ,” “And so I will go into the king, 
even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from 
sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed 
and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had 
fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king 
was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ” then we 
should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing 
deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages 
ordained that we open the prayers with the word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  recalling the words of Esther; therewith

broken hearts and tearfilled eyes.\par

Influence be attached to it. This essence (Yisrael) was created for the sake of an even more 
treasured essence, namely the prophets and the pious among them. This gradation forms the basis 
of the sequence of the Rosh Hashana±Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that 
You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally 
by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and 
fulfillment of the entire creation, the true reason for celebrating these holy days (Fundamentals of

power; holy [is He] forever and for all eternity.” The Talmud, (Maseches Chulin 91b) refers to this 
verse as the “Sanctification of the Angels.” According to Avudraham and Yaavetz, this Kedushah 
has been inserted here to refute those who maintain that Hashem relinquished His control over 
the heavenly bodies, and they are now able to function independently. We are therefore told that 
all the heavenly hosts proclaim Hashem’s sanctification and dominion over all the universe.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*41>}41{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Yechezkel 3:12. According to the Kuzari, Hashem’s glory is a euphemism for Hashem 
Himself. Thus the verse means, “Blessed is Adonoy from His place,” conveying this concept: 
Hashem is more blessed (i.e., greater) than His place; He is not confined to any place. Another 
view set forth in the Kuzari is that “Hashem’s glory” includes the angels, His throne, His chariot, 
the firmament, and the spheres. These are called Hashem’s glory similar to a king’s retinue which 
is his royal splendor.\par

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*43>}43{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair was given two measures of barley for safekeeping. The owner 
forgot about it for a number of years. Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair planted the barley seed, and each 
year replanted the previous year’s harvest until it grew to be a substantial crop. After seven years, 
the owner returned to claim his two measures of barley and Rabbi Pinchas told him, “Come I will 
show you the great fortune you have accumulated.” Hashem does the same with the good and 
righteous deeds of man. He sows each righteous deed, and when the person is ready to receive 
his reward, Hashem returns the original righteous investment plus all the accumulated 
dividends. Midrash Rabba, Devarim 3:6\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*44>}44{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Since the blessing began with the praise of Hashem as the Former of light Who continually 
renews the creation, it concludes on the same note.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*45>}45{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Tehillim 136:7.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*46>}46{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}We pray that we will be worthy of enjoying the original light of creation, which Hashem 
put aside for the righteous in the future world.—Yaavetz\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*47>}47{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}When reciting this blessing, bear in mind that even though the heavenly spheres appear 
immense to us and we attach much importance to them because of the vital functions they 
perform, in the eyes of their Creator they are no greater than worms. On the contrary, His wisdom 
and providence are more acutely recognized in an ant or bee because, in spite of their minuteness, 
they are endowed with a complex of faculties and organs.—Kuzari\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*48>}48{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The Kuzari writes, “When reciting the blessing ‘Unbounded Love’ {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e0\'c7\'e4\'c2\'e1\'c8\'e4 \'f8\'c7\'e1\'cc\'c8\'e4{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch , one should 
bear in mind that Hashem’s Divine influence is especially directed at the Jewish People who 
receive it as naturally as a mirror receives rays of light. He should also bear in mind that the Torah 
is the expression of Hashem’s will and through it He establishes His dominion on earth as in 
heaven. Whenever an individual or a community attains a high degree of spiritual purity, they 
become worthy of receiving the Divine light to guide their destiny in a miraculous manner far 
removed from the ordinary course of events which affect the world. This special relationship with 
the Creator is called love.”\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*49>}49{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Hashem bestowed His great and abundant pity on us after we sinned in making the golden

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*50>}50{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}We preserve the Torah by not forgetting its teachings; we practice the commandments and

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*52>}52{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}When one has to receive a favor that is completely undeserved, he feels a sense of shame. 
We therefore pray to Hashem, that our redemption will not be a “hand out” without merit and 
cause us to be ashamed. We proclaim that since we “trusted in His Name” and accepted the 
bitterness of our exile, our deliverance is not totally undeserved.—Siach Yitzchak\par

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*57>}57{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Devarim 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. 
This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last 
letter of the first word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'f9\'d1\'c0\'ee\'c7\'f2{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  and last letter of {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e0\'c6\'e7\'c8\'e3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  are written larger than the others. These two 
letters form the word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'f2\'c5\'e3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to Hashem’s 
unity.—Avudraham\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all 
distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on Hashem’s unity. The last word, {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e0\'c6\'e7\'c8\'e3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  “One,” 
is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that 
Hashem, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the 
unique God of Yisrael, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*58>}58{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah 
departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His 
sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Yisrael” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only 
One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Yaakov said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to 
his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moshe did 
not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Yaakov ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be 
said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}When Moshe went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise Hashem by saying, “Blessed 
[is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an 
undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like 
angels, we are permitted to say {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e1\'cc\'c8\'f8\'e5\'cc\'ea\'c0 \'f9\'d1\'c5\'ed{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  aloud.—Midrash Rabba to Devarim\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*59>}59{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Our Sages (Sifrei to Devarim 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your 
desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to 
Hashem’s Law and make them instruments for His service.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*60>}60{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of 
blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was 
tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved 
Hashem with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole 
life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their 
faith.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*61>}61{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The Sages (ibid.) explain, “With whatever lot Providence has assigned to you,” i.e., despite

recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose 
this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on 
behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and 
nights on her behalf, she said, “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, 
since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One 
Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur 
Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last 
words of the verse said by Esther, “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ,” “And so I will go into the king, 
even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from 
sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed 
and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had 
fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king 
was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ” then we 
should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing 
deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages 
ordained that we open the prayers with the word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  recalling the words of Esther; therewith 
shattering our delusions of spiritual complacency, and causing us to bow before Him with broken 
hearts and tearfilled eyes.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*15>}15{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'fa\'cc\'c5\'ef{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  implies {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'ee\'c7\'fa\'cc\'c8\'f0\'c8\'e4{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch , a gift.

Therefore, the gates do not open willingly to permit the glory of Hashem to enter, and must be 
opened by force. Ultimately, however, the world will be so spiritually saturated that it will

{\highlight7 @sn}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}According to Dover Shalom these two types of offerings can be compared to two kinds of 
prayers. The truly pious Jew is concerned only with serving his Creator and his prayers are 
offered entirely to Hashem. He asks nothing for himself. His prayers are similar to a burnt 
offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a 
lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs 
and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'f9\'d1\'c0\'ec\'c8\'ee\'c4\'e9\'ed{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch , peace offering, of which only part is consumed 
on the altar, the owner also being permitted to eat and enjoy part of it. We pray that both kinds 
of prayers be pleasing and acceptable to Hashem, as were the sacrifices on the altar.\par

view set forth in the Kuzari is that “Hashem’s glory” includes the angels, His throne, His chariot,

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*38>}38{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Devarim 6:4. It is customary to recite this verse aloud, the ear hearing what the lips utter. 
This helps one concentrate on the meaning of this important declaration. Interestingly, the last 
letter of the first word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'f9\'d1\'c0\'ee\'c7\'f2{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  and last letter of {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e0\'c6\'e7\'c8\'e3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  are written larger than the others. These two letters 
form the word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'f2\'c5\'e3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch “witness”—i.e., every Jew by saying Shema testifies to Hashem’s 
unity.—Avudraham\par
{\highlight7 @sn}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}Customarily one closes his eyes when pronouncing this testimony in order to shut out all 
distractions, and to concentrate all one’s thought on Hashem’s unity. The last word, {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e0\'c6\'e7\'c8\'e3{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  “One,” 
is to be said with special emphasis, drawing it out for the length of time needed to reflect that 
Hashem, the Giver and Sustainer of life Whose Providence guides the destinies of all men, is the 
unique God of Yisrael, that He is alone in His world, ruling all four corners of the universe.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*39>}39{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Yaakov wished to reveal to his sons the ‘end of the days,’ whereupon the Shechinah 
departed from him. Said he, “Perhaps, Heaven forbid! there is one unfit among my children.” His 
sons exclaimed to him, “Hear Yisrael” etc., just as there is only One in your heart so is there only 
One in our heart. Ben Lakish explained that Yaakov said “Blessed [is His] Name” in response to 
his sons’ exclamation. The Sages wondered, “Shall we recite it aloud when our teacher Moshe did 
not say it? Shall we not say it at all, when Yaakov ordained it?” Thus the Rabbis enacted that it be 
said quietly.—Maseches Pesachim 56a.\par
{\highlight7 @sn}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}When Moshe went up to the heavens, he heard the angels praise Hashem by saying, “Blessed 
[is His] Name, etc.” When he returned to earth, he taught it to the Jewish People. We say it in an 
undertone so as not to offend the angels. On Yom Kippur however, when we are considered like 
angels, we are permitted to say {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e1\'cc\'c8\'f8\'e5\'cc\'ea\'c0 \'f9\'d1\'c5\'ed{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  aloud.—Midrash Rabba to Devarim\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*40>}40{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}Our Sages (Sifrei to Devarim 31) explain “With all your heart” to mean “With all your 
desires—including the evil inclination,” i.e., subject your earthly passions and ambitions to 
Hashem’s Law and make them instruments for His service.\par
{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}{\highlight7 <*41>}41{\highlight7 @b2}{\highlight7 <EN>}The Sages (ibid.) take these words to mean “With your whole life—even to the last drop of 
blood.” It was such an understanding that led Rabbi Akiva to say, when the executioner was 
tearing his flesh with iron hooks, “All my life, I have longed for this moment. I have loved 
Hashem with all my heart and with all my might; and now at last, I can love Him with my whole 
life.” It was this concept that gave Jewish martyrs the courage to lay down their lives for their 
faith.\par

recited at each Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur service. According to Avudraham, the Sages chose 
this word to convey the thought expressed by Esther as she prepared to go before the king on 
behalf of her people. After telling Mordechai to assemble all the Jews to fast for three days and 
nights on her behalf, she said, “ {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  and so I will go in to the king” (Esther 4:16). Thus, 
since today is the Day of Judgment, as we come before the Supreme King of kings, the Holy One 
Blessed is He, we begin with the words uttered by Esther as she came before the king. The Siddur 
Maggid Tzedek quoted by Siach Yitzchak writes that the emphasis of Avudraham was on the last 
words of the verse said by Esther, “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ,” “And so I will go into the king, 
even if it is unlawful,” for which one of us can say, “I am virtuous, I have cleansed my heart from 
sin.” Especially on this great and awesome Day of Judgment, who among us is not embarrassed 
and ashamed to appear before the King of kings garbed in sackcloths of sin. If Esther who had 
fasted for three days in penitence and prayer in preparation for her appearance before the king 
was nevertheless so terribly frightened that she declared: “{\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef \'e0\'c8\'e1\'e5\'c9\'e0 \'e0\'c6\'ec \'e4\'c7\'ee\'cc\'c6\'ec\'c6\'ea\'c0 \'e0\'c2\'f9\'d1\'c6\'f8 \'ec\'c9\'e0 \'eb\'c7\'e3\'cc\'c8\'fa{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch ” then we 
should certainly tremble in awe before the presence of Hashem on this Day of Judgment, knowing 
deep in our hearts how little and how poorly we have prepared ourselves. Thus our Sages 
ordained that we open the prayers with the word {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'e5\'cc\'e1\'c0\'eb\'c5\'ef{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch  recalling the words of Esther; therewith

hearts and tearfilled eyes.\par

of the sequence of the Rosh Hashana±Yom Kippur prayers: “Grant that Your awe be upon all that 
You have made,” is the first prayer. It is followed by, “Grant honor to Your people,” and finally 
by “the righteous will see this and rejoice.” Thus the righteous and pious are the purpose and

offering which is consumed in its entirety on Hashem’s altar. Not every Jew is capable of such a 
lofty degree of Divine service. Many serve Hashem but are conscious of their own personal needs 
and desires. Their prayer is thus similar to a {\highlight7 @hh}{\highlight7 <HEB>}\rtlch \'f9\'d1\'c0\'ec\'c8\'ee\'c4\'e9\'ed{\highlight7 {\ltrch @ee}}{\highlight7 {\ltrch<}{\ltrch ENG}{\ltrch>}}\ltrch , peace offering, of which only part is consumed

{\highlight7 @b1}{\highlight7 <EM>}{\highlight7 <EN>}The Talmud designates psalm 82 for the third day of the week because on the third day of 
creation, Hashem in His wisdom revealed the earth and established the world for His chosen 
“congregation.” This is an allusion to Bereishis 1:9 where we read, “Hashem said, ‘Let the waters 
beneath the heavens be gathered (congregate) into one place, so that the dry land may 
appear.”—Maseches Rosh Hashana 31a\par
