During the last two thousand years, Jews have never wearied of
referring to the Exodus. In the morning and evening prayers, in
the thanksgiving benediction after each meal, and in the
Kiddush inaugurating Shabbat and Festivals, Jews have thanked
God for having delivered their ancestors from Egypt. And every
year with the return of the Festival of Pesah/± they have recounted
to their children the story of that redemption. The main motive
which has kept alive the memory of the Exodus during the last
two thousand years has undoubtedly been the hope that, as God
had wrought miracles for Israel in the past, had been gracious
to them and had delivered them from bondage, so will God,
when the time comes, once again manifest power on behalf of
the Jewish people, free them from oppression and restore them
to their land./PR
/PR
Changes, however, have taken place in human life which render
that simple version of Exodus and its meaning no longer
adequate. Jews are still the victims of oppression. But they have
entered into such intimate relationship with the life of the world
about them that they can no longer envisage their own
deliverance except as a phase of general human deliverance. If
miracles are to be enacted as part of the future redemption, they
cannot be conceived as similar to those which tradition associates
with the Exodus. The new redemption to which Jews look
forward involves the redemption of society in general from
present ills. It implies the transformation of human nature and
social institutions through the divine power of intelligence and
goodwill. There can be no question that in the Torah the story
of the Exodus has the connotation that to help the oppressed is
an essential attribute of godhood./PR

So pharaonic oppression, deliverance, Sinai, and Canaan are still
with us, powerful memories shaping our perceptions of the
political world. The "door of hope" is still open; things are not
what they might be--even when what they might be isnÚt
totally different from what they are....We still believe, or many
of us do, what the Exodus first taught, or what it has commonly
been taken to teach, about the meaning and possibility of politics
and about its proper form:/PR
--first, that wherever you live, it is probably Egypt;/PR
--second, that there is a better place, a world more attractive, a
promised land;/PR
--and third, that "the way to the land is through the
wilderness." There is no way to get from here to there except
by joining together and marching./PR

We cannot actually picture goodness. It is not a being; it is a
force, like electricity. Nobody ever actually saw electricity. We
know that it exists. We can see and feel what electricity does. If
we have an electric heater and connect it, we get heat. If we
have an electric motor and attach it to a vehicle, we get the
vehicle to move. In other words, we get to know what electricity
is by what it does. In the same way, we get to know what God
is by what God makes us do: when people are, so to speak,
connected with God, they do good things. We call such people
godly and their acts godly. Whenever this force is active, we say
that God has exercised influence and power./PR
/PR
Belief in God, therefore, has to do...with human nature, with
the way individual men and women act, with their attitudes,
their ideas of what is good and what is bad, with their ideals.
Belief in God has to do with our attitude toward life itself. Do
we find life good? Is life worthwhile? If we believe that life is
worthwhile, that it is good, that, in spite of sickness and
accidents, in spite of poverty and war, in spite of all the sad and
difficult conditions in the world, the world is a wonderful place
to live in and can be made a still better place, then we believe
in God. When we believe in God, we cannot be discouraged
because we believe that all the misery in the world is due, not
to the fact that misery must be there, that it is a necessary part
of life, but to the fact that we have not yet discovered how to
do away with that misery./PR

In Germany, the Nazis first came for the Communists, and I did
not speak up because I was not a Communist. Then they came
for the Jews, but I did not speak up because I was not a Jew.
And then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak
up because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for the
Catholics, but I was a Protestant, so I did not speak up. And
then they came for me, and by that time there was no one left
to speak up for anyone. To make sure this does not happen again,
the injustice to anyone anywhere must be the concern of
everyone everywhere./PR

In religion, we try to find answers to the elementary questions
that confront each of us every morning. What meaning and
what value is to be ascribed to our life? What am I to this world?
What is my purpose in it? What may I hope for in this world?
I do not want to consider my existence merely as one that rises
and perishes among the multitude of beings that constitute the
universe, but as a life that has value./PR

/ITShalom/XX is one of the many names by which God is known in
Judaism. It is the name by which God will bless you if you
dedicate yourselves to each other in accordance with the divine
will. The name /ITShalom/XX embraces everything that is calculated
to render life happy, useful and holy. It denotes, in the first
place, love--love that is binding and everlasting, love that does
not fade with the flowers or pass with the sunshine. /ITShalom/XX is
the peace that is secured when we have done our share toward
our companions, whenever we bring light into hearts that are
dark with despair and cheer into souls overcast with gloom. No
language possesses a word that so accurately describes the
serenity of the soul which we experience whenever we have thus
made GodÚs presence real to men and women. By seeking to
promote the happiness of your neighbor, by engaging in every
effort to be of help to your companion and by emphasizing that
aspect of life that we call holy, you will realize the full blessing
of love and peace, the blessing of /ITShalom/XX./PR
