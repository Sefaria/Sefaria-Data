            "<b>For the Chief Musician, with Neginoth, on the Sheminith. A Psalm of David.</b> - Already we have explained the sense of Neginoth and Sheminith and the other kinds of musical instruments in the Psalm Answer me when I call (Ps. iv.). There are some (Targum ad loc.) who interpret Sheminith as a lyre which had eight strings, and the Psalm as being recited to the accompaniment of this music. The Haggadic interpretation (Babli, Menahoth 43 b) (applies it) to circumcision, which was performed on the eighth day, but this is far-fetched. This Psalm possibly was uttered by David with reference to his sickness ; it is also possible likewise that it was uttered in the language of anyone crushed by sickness, for David composed many of the Psalms which combine prayer and supplication that they might be suitable for any suppliant ; and such, I think, is the case in this Psalm. And some say (Ibn Ezra ad loc.) that it was uttered with reference to the Exile, for Israel in exile was like those who are sick and crushed."

As Hezekiah (Is. xxxviii. 18) says : \"For Sheol cannot praise Thee, death cannot celebrate Thee\" etc. ; and David says (Ps. cxviii. 17) : \"I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the Lord.\" For the body after the departure of the spirit is as a dumb stone, and it descends to Sheol ; but the spirit ascends and praises and glorifies for ever without ceasing. But the righteous longs to live to do the will of God while he is yet alive in order to increase the reward of his soul in the world to come."

            "<b>I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim ; I melt my couch with my tears.</b> - For I groan and am anxious on account of my sickness and weep until I make my bed swim every night, because at night the sickness is grievous, and a man laments and weeps on account of his sickness. Or he weeps at night because the household is asleep and no one sees him. And lo ! he is weary with groaning and with weeping. And as for what he says : I make to swim and I water - it is by way of exaggeration and hyperbole. And the interpretation of  אשחה (I make to swim) is (to be derived) from (such passages) as : \"as he that swimmeth (השחה) spreadeth out his hands to swim (לשׂחות)\" (Is. xxv. 11); or from the Targum (rendering) of \"and he washed (וירחץ)\" (Gen. xliii. 31), which is ואסתי. And the interpretation of אמסה (I melt) is (to be gathered) from (such passages) as : \" they made the heart of the people melt (המסיו)\" (Josh. xiv. 8) ; \"and like a moth Thou makest his beauty to melt away (ותמס)\" (Ps. xxxix. 12). These (instances) are from verbs lamed he of the hifil conjugation. And there are many (cases) of double 'ayin verbs of this signification, as : \"They have made my heart to melt (הֵמַסּוּ)\" (Deut. i. 28) ; \"and the heart of the people melted (וַיִּמָּס)\" (Josh. vii. 8).",

The expressions decayed (\"moth-eaten\") and removed (ועתקה ועשׁשׁה) are used hyperbolically. And the explanation of with (ב) all my adversaries is \"on account of\" (בעבור) all my adversaries. And there are some (Targum, Rashi ad loc.) who explain עתקה in the sense of \"is grown old (נת ישנה),\" in accordance with the Targum rendering of ישׁן (\"the old store\") in Lev. xxv. 22 by עתיק.",
