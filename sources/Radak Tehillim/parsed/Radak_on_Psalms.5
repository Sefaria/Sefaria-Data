            "<b>For the Chief Musician : To the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David.</b> - I have already explained the meaning of the Nehiloth and other kinds of music in the previous Psalm. Our teacher Hai, of blessed memory, explained the word (nehiloth) from the expression nehil (נהיל), (meaning) \"a swarm\" of bees, in the words of our sages of blessed memory (Mishnah, Baba Kamma x. 2). He means that its music was like the buzzing of bees. This Psalm is also likewise directed against David's enemies, those in Israel who were ill-disposed to him. Our rabbis of blessed memory have said (Midrash, Shoher Tob, ad loc.) that he uttered it against his adversaries Doeg and Ahithophel.",

Therefore he uses the word consider with meditation, and give ear to with my words. He uses (the term) הגיגי (\"my meditation\"), which is derived from הגה by doubling the second radical, just as (in the verse) \"for the lightning (חזיז) of the thunder\" (Job xxxviii. 25), (where חזיז is derived) from חזה."

And so it is written (Prov. ii. 2): \" to incline (להקשׁיב) thine ear unto wisdom\"; \"Thou wilt make attentive thine ear\" (Ps. x. 17). The word is connected with (the prepositions) ל, אל, and ב ; and sometimes it is (used) without any connecting letter (at all), as ואשׁמע הקשבתי , \"I hearkened and heard\" (Jer. viii. 6) ; דברו הקשׁיב מי, \"Who hath hearkened to his word? \" (ibid, xxiii. 17).",

            "<b>my watchful foes (שׁררי)</b> - is the equivalent of \"my enemies,\" and is derived from (the verb) \" I spy him (אשׁורנו), but not nigh\" (Num. xxiv. 17), because he is looking for evil, as (in the verse) \"Saul eyed David\" (1 Sam. xviii. 9). And this prayer is that He (God) should deliver him from faults and from deliberate sins, as he says (in the verses Ps. xix. 13, 14) : \"Clear me from hidden (faults); moreover, from deliberate sins restrain Thy servant.\"",

And Kethib has waw on the analogy of verbs with the first radical quiescent ; and so with the pathah of the second radical (הושר הישַׁר), as also (in the verse) : \"Cause Thy mighty ones to come down (המחת), O Lord\" (Joel iv. 11)."

And he attributes (the uttering of) words to the throat, as (in the passage) : \"Let the high praises of God be in their throat\" (Ps. cxlix. 6), for some letters are pronounced in the throat. Further, all speech has its beginning from the throat, for the voice proceeds from the throat and makes speech possible to the mouth. Moreover, because the throat is open to the inside, which he compares to a sepulchre, he says their throat. And the word נכונה (straightforwardness) is a feminine adjective, but the substantive is wanting, and we must supply (in thought) אמרה (\"utterance\") or דברה (\"word\"); and so \"his meat (m.) is fat\" [בראה fem., i.e. \"a fat thing,\" Hab. i. 16] : \"like a flock (of ewes) that are shorn \" [lit. \"of the shorn ones,\" הקצובות, Cant. iv. 2]; \"he answereth roughly\" [lit. \"rough things,\" עזות; Prov. xviii. 23] ; and similar passages."
