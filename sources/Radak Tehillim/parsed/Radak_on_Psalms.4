            "<b>For the Chief Musician : on Neginoth. A Psalm of David :</b> - Our teachers of blessed memory have said (Shoher Tod, ad loc.) that \"this Psalm was uttered in three kinds of praise, in nissuah (נצוח), in niggun (ןגוי), and in mizmor (מזמור).\" It is evident that the (person called the) מנצח (\"Chief Musician\") is the one who was over the singers, and that the Psalms were rendered under the direction of the(se) \"Chief Musicians,\" who assigned them to (certain) players and singers. [This view is supported by the fact that] you nowhere find [as titles] \"For the Singer\" or \"For the Player,\" but only For the Chief Musician. And accordingly we have in the Prayer of Habakkuk (iii. 19) \"For the Chief Musician on my stringed instruments\" ; and so the text (1 Chron. xxiii. 4) \"to superintend (לנצח) the work of the house of the Lord.\" It is written also (ibid. xv. 21) \"with harps set to the Sheminith to lead (לנצח).\" And it is the case that there was a \"Chief Musician\" over the instrument called Neginoth and another over that called Sheminith. And the songs and the melodies and the praises were rendered each according to the melody known in connexion with them ; for it was a great science and would stimulate the rational soul, and was reckoned in the category of secular sciences. And the instruments which were (used) in the Temple for praise were lutes, lyres, cymbals, trumpets, and a horn. The instruments also were classified according to melodies known in connexion with them. Of the melodies there was that called Alamoth, as in the text (1 Chron. xv. 20) and written (Ps. xlvi. 1), \"Set to Alamoth. A Song.\" And there was that called Neginoth, and in this the present Psalm was rendered. And there was one of them called Maskil, and there was one of them called Mikhtam. There was also Shiggaion, and there was Nehiloth, and there was Shigionoth, and there was Gittith. One of the instruments was called \"Tenstrings,\" another \"Pipes,\" and another \"Minnim.\" And each of these is classified in its melody as it was known to the masters of the science. We find also a text which says (i Chron. xxiii. 5), \"And four thousand praised the Lord with the instruments I made to praise.\" It is not known, however, whether the instruments were in the hands of those who were actually reciting the Psalm, or whether they acted together - those who sang with the mouth, and opposite them those who played upon (musical) instruments. We find also another text which says (2 Chron. vii. 6), \"And the Levites with the instruments of music of the Lord which David the king had made to give thanks unto the Lord, for His mercy (endureth) for ever, when David praised by their ministry : and the priests sounded the trumpets before them.\" And further it is written (ibid. xxix. 28), \"and the singers sang and the trumpeters sounded.\" Now the trumpets alone were in the hands of the priests, as it is written (Num. x. 8), \"and the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets ;\" and the rest of the instruments were in the hands of the Levites ; and so it is written (2 Chron. xxix. 26), \"And the Levites stood with the instruments of David and the priests with the trumpets.\""

            "<b>Answer me when I call, O God (Judge) of my righteousness :</b> - It is certain that this Psalm likewise was uttered (by David) in his flight before Absalom ; and he says, Answer me when I call, O God (Judge) of my righteousness, for Thou knowest that with me is the right, and with him who is against me the wrong and the violence ; and Thou, Lord, art Judge over us. For in every instance where אלהים ('Elohim) occurs it has the meaning \"judge,\" as we have interpreted the verse \"Verily there is a God (Judge) that judges in the earth\" (Ps. lviii. 12). And men who are judges are so called : \"The cause of both parties shall come before the 'Elohim (judges)\" (Exod. xxii. 8) ; 'Then his master shall bring him unto 'Elohim (the judges)\" (ibid. xxi. 6).",

There is also (a stillness) which is (equivalent to) silence of action and movement, as \"He turneth the storm to stillness\" (Ps. cvii. 29) ; \"my bowels boil and are not still\" (Job xxx. 27) ; \"and the sun stood still\" (Josh. x. 13) ; \"Be still (tarry) until we come unto you\" (1 Sam. xiv. 9) ; \"To the still stone\" (Hab. ii. 19), and (other instances) similar to these. And of this meaning is (the sentence) Be still : Selah, as though to say : \"Cease you from your works.\" And the great teacher of righteousness, our master Moses ben Maimon, has explained (Guide for the Perplexed, Bk. I. 50, 59) that this verse commands men of intelligence and reputation to recognise the truth and the praise of God in their hearts, so that no error of speech shall overtake them.
