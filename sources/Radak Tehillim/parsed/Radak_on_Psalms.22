            "<b>For the Chief Musician. Set to \"The Hind of the Morning.\" A Psalm of David.</b> - There are those who say (Rashi, and others beside him) that השׁהר אילת (hind of the morning) is a kind of musical instrument. There are also interpreters (Targumist, Menahem,  and others besides) who explain אילת from (אילותי in) My succour (אילותי), haste Thee to help me (infra, 20), meaning that this Psalm was uttered in the strength of the morning's dawn. And some interpret אילת as the name of the morning star. So we have in the words of our Rabbis of blessed memory (Jerushalami, Berakhoth i. 1 ; Yoma iii. 2) : \"They call the morning star Ayyeleth.\" They say also (ibid. ; Canticles Rabbah 6 ; Esther Rabbah 10 end ; and Shoher Tob, ad loc.) that this Psalm was uttered with reference to Esther and to Israel, who were in exile at that time. Some also interpret it of David while he was still a fugitive before Saul. The correct view is that the title The Hind of the Morning is used of the congregation of Israel while in this (present) exile, and the end of the Psalm proves this. It calls her a hind, just as the comparison is applied to her in the Song of Songs (ii. 7 ; iii. 5) : \"among the roes or among the hinds of the field\" The meaning also of השחר (the morning) is beauty and brightness, as it says concerning her (ibid. vi. 10) : \"Who is she that looketh forth as the morning ?\" And now she is in darkness in this exile, as if forgotten and abandoned ; and she cries out from exile :",

The learned Rabbi Abraham,  however, has expounded the whole verse in another sense.

            " <b>how He hath done :</b> - what He has done for them ; for, because these will not have seen the work of the Lord that He did in the case of themselves and their fathers, they shall declare it to them. The uncircumcised have interpreted this Psalm of Jesus (in the sense that) it tells of all the evils which Israel did to him. Lo ! the Son cries to the Father out of his troubles and says : My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? and so all the Psalm. They corrupt the word כארי (as a lion) in the clause ורגלי ידי כארי (as a lion my hands and my feet), and read כארו (they pierce), giving it the meaning (of כרה in) \" if a man shall dig (יכרה) a pit\" (Exod. xxi. 33), because they drove nails through his hands and feet when they hanged him. Also the verse and his soul he hath not kept alive has led them astray, for they say that this one is God, before whom all who go down to the dust shall bow, and he did not wish to keep his soul alive, because he came down to assume (human) flesh conditionally that they might kill the flesh, and that by this those who go down to Gehenna might be saved. So, forsooth, he did not desire to keep his soul alive, but surrendered himself into the power of those who slew him. Now let them hear what is involved in their words ! They say that he did not wish to keep his soul alive nor rescue it from the power of those who slew him. If so, why did he cry : My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me? ( Why art Thou so) far from helping me ? if he had no desire to be saved ? Has he not forgotten the condition (of his taking flesh)? He says also : but Thou answerest not, and perhaps does not wish to be answered? And further, if he were really God, he would be able to save himself ; and further, when he says the praises of Israel, when it is they who are doing him evil ? How could he say that they are praising God? Once again he says : Our fathers trusted in Thee ; and if he was what they allege, he had only one father. Again, this God says of himself that he is a worm and no man, forsooth ! Lo ! he says : One that is committed to the Lord, him He will deliver, He will rescue him. If (he spoke) of the (human) flesh. He did not deliver nor rescue him ; and if of the Godhead, there was no need of rescue. He says also : But Thou art He that took me out of the womb i.e. he himself it was who brought out of the womb. And he says : I will declare Thy name to my brethren, although God has no brethren. And notice it is false, for the declaring and praising and thanksgiving are to follow the rescuing, and you know he was not rescued. He also says : All ye of the seed of Jacob, glorify Him. . . . For He hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, while Israel it was who did him evil ; and his affliction the Father despised and abhorred, and hid His face from him, and on his crying unto Him did not hearken. Behold, all his words are belied. Then he says, All the kindreds of the nations, while, as you see, the Jews and the Mohammedans do not believe in him."
