            "<b>For the Precentor : 'al muth labben : A Psalm of David.</b> - The majority of the interpreters (Rabbi Dunash the Levite and Ibn Ezra) say that David uttered it with reference to one of his enemies who died, one of the princes of the heathen, who oppressed Israel and whose name was Labben ; and that when he died David uttered this Psalm. Some also say (Ibn Ezra, ad loc.) that Labben (לבן) is an inversion of Nabal (נבל), and they say that David uttered this Psalm when Nabal the Carmelite died. But this is very far-fetched ; for the subject-matter of the Psalm tells of a man who did evil to Israel, while Nabal did no harm to anyone, but simply was avaricious. And some say (ibid.) that לבן is to be read as if written with a yodh (לבין), and then the reference is to Goliath, who is called a champion (הַבֵּנַיִם  אִישׁ) ; and when David had killed him he uttered this Psalm. My revered father, of blessed memory, has (also) written that this Psalm was (originally) uttered with reference to Goliath ; but he explained לבן (as referring) to a singer whose name was Ben (בֵּן), as it is written in Chronicles ( I Chron. xv. 1 8) : \" and with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel ; \" and he explained מות על, which is two words [ = on the death of], as one word, עלמות, from (the expression) שׁיר עלמות; and similar instances of words divided into two, but with the significance of a single word, are קוח פקח (= release, Is. lxi. i), פיה יפה (= very fair, Jer. xlvi. 20), and יונים לגאי ( = proud, Ps. cxxiii. 4). And although the lamedh of  לַבֵּן, is vocalised with the vowel pathah, and this is not in accordance with usage in the case of a man's name - for you do not say ליצחק, לַידותון, because the article is not employed with a proper name - nevertheless the article here is employed to indicate that he speaks with reference to Ben the singer ; for if he had said לְבן (pointed) with sheva it would not have been clear that he was speaking of the singer whose name was Ben. At all events, it is admissible to interpret the subject-matter of the Psalm as having reference to Goliath the Philistine."

And as he said, their name Thou hast blotted out, so here he addresses the enemy : \"thy name is blotted out as the name of the cities thou hast devastated is blotted out ; or, as they have come to an end for ever and their memorial is perished, so has thy memorial perished now.\" And my revered father, of blessed memory, expounds : destructions have come to an end, חרבות תמו - i.e. the destructions thou wast making shalt thou cause no more. And the learned Rabbi Abraham ben Ezra, of blessed memory, ex-pounds (ad loc.) : because the destructions which thou hast made have come to an end and the cities which thou hast uprooted, their memorial is perished, thou hast thought to escape ; and hast forgotten that the Lord sitteth enthroned for ever. The explanation (of המה in) המה וזכרם (their very memorial) is, it intensifies the pronominal suffix, for (the sense) would have been represented sufficiently by the mem of זכרם (their memorial). Or its interpretation may be their memorial has perished so (completely) that those who see it shall say : \"These surely are not the cities that were built !\" And on this interpretation המה will be explained as (to be read) with a mark of interjection."

It lacks the complete sign of the plural feminine, having the plural masculine suffix termination only. And similar examples are : \" I am wearied in the multitude of thy counsels \" (עֲצָתָיִךְ, Is. xlvii. 13) ; \"And thy sisters (וַאֲחוֹתַיִךְ, Ezek. xvi. 55), Sodom and her daughters\" (see the interpretation our rabbi (ad loc.) gives). And in that he says here all Thy praises ; and in another place (Ps. cvi. 2) asks, \"Who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord?\" David says, I will shew forth all Thy praises. In spite of all the troubles which came upon him, he gave praise and (made) confession to God, who delivered him from the enemies ; but when he comes to narrate the wondrous signs He had given Israel generation after generation, he asks, \"Who can make known all His praise ?\" And so the individual alone is not able to tell the wondrous signs of goodness and mercy which the Holy One - Blessed be He ! - worketh for him, as he says (ibid. xl. 6), \"If I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.\" For sometimes God - Blessed be He ! - does a wondrous sign for a man who is unaware of it until later when he reflects upon it. And so our rabbis of blessed memory have said (Babli, Niddah 31 a), \"Even he to whom the wondrous sign happens does not recognise it.\" And when David says all Thy praises, he speaks of the wondrous signs which He had wrought for him which were evident and known to all in the war with the enemies."
