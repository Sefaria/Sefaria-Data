<p>Containing The Interval Of Forty Years.</p>
<p>From The Death Of Saul To The Death Of David.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 1.</p>
<p>How David Reigned Over One Tribe At Hebron While The Son Of Saul 
Reigned Over The Rest Of The Multitude; And How, In The Civil War Which 
Then Arose Asahel And Abner Were Slain.</p>
<p>1. This fight proved to be on the same day whereon David was come 
back to Ziklag, after he had overcome the Amalekites. Now when he had 
been already two days at Ziklag, there came to him the man who slew 
Saul, which was the third day after the fight. He had escaped out of the
 battle which the Israelites had with the Philistines, and had his 
clothes rent, and ashes upon his head. And when he made his obeisance to
 David, he inquired of him whence he came. He replied, from the battle 
of the Israelites; and he informed him that the end of it was 
unfortunate, many ten thousands of the Israelites having been cut off, 
and Saul, together with his sons, slain. He also said that he could well
 give him this information, because he was present at the victory gained
 over the Hebrews, and was with the king when he fled. Nor did he deny 
that he had himself slain the king, when he was ready to be taken by the
 enemy, and he himself exhorted him to do it, because, when he was 
fallen on his sword, his great wounds had made him so weak that he was 
not able to kill himself. He also produced demonstrations that the king 
was slain, which were the golden bracelets that had been on the king's 
arms, and his crown, which he had taken away from Saul's dead body, and 
had brought them to him. So David having no longer any room to call in 
question the truth of what he said, but seeing most evident marks that 
Saul was dead, he rent his garments, and continued all that day with his
 companions in weeping and lamentation. This grief was augmented by the 
consideration of Jonathan; the son of Saul, who had been his most 
faithful friend, and the occasion of his own deliverance. He also 
demonstrated himself to have such great virtue, and such great kindness 
for Saul, as not only to take his death to heart, though he had been 
frequently in danger of losing his life by his means, but to punish him 
that slew him; for when David had said to him that he was become his own
 accuser, as the very man who had slain the king, and when he had 
understood that he was the son of an Amalekite, he commanded him to be 
slain. He also committed to writing some lamentations and funeral 
commendations of Saul and Jonathan, which have continued to my own age.</p>
<p>2. Now when David had paid these honors to the king, he left off his 
mourning, and inquired of God by the prophet which of the cities of the 
tribe of Judah he would bestow upon him to dwell in; who answered that 
he bestowed upon him Hebron. So he left Ziklag, and came to Hebron, and 
took with him his wives, who were in number two, and his armed men; 
whereupon all the people of the forementioned tribe came to him, and 
ordained him their king. But when he heard that the inhabitants of 
Jabesh-gilead had buried Saul and his sons [honorably], he sent to them 
and commended them, and took what they had done kindly, and promised to 
make them amends for their care of those that were dead; and at the same
 time he informed them that the tribe of Judah had chosen him for their 
king.</p>
<p>3. But as soon as Abner, the son of Ner, who was general of Saul's 
army, and a very active man, and good-natured, knew that the king, and 
Jonathan, and his two other sons, were fallen in the battle, he made 
haste into the camp; and taking away with him the remaining son of Saul,
 whose name was Ishbosheth, he passed over to the land beyond Jordan, 
and ordained him the king of the whole multitude, excepting the tribe of
 Judah; and made his royal seat in a place called in our own language 
Mahanaim, but in the language of the Grecians, The Camps; from whence 
Abner made haste with a select body of soldiers, to fight with such of 
the tribe of Judah as were disposed to it, for he was angry that this 
tribe had set up David for their king. But Joab, whose father was Suri, 
and his mother Zeruiah, David's sister, who was general of David's army,
 met him, according to David's appointment. He had with him his 
brethren, Abistiai and Asahel, as also all David's armed men. Now when 
he met Abner at a certain fountain, in the city of Gibeon, he prepared 
to fight. And when Abner said to him, that he had a mind to know which 
of them had the more valiant soldiers, it was agreed between them that 
twelve soldiers of each side should fight together. So those that were 
chosen out by both the generals for this fight came between the two 
armies, and throwing their lances one against the other, they drew their
 swords, and catching one another by the head, they held one another 
fast, and ran each other's swords into their sides and groins, until 
they all, <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="179" data-page-number="179" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/193"></span></span>as
 it were by mutual agreement, perished together. When these were fallen 
down dead, the rest of the army came to a sore battle, and Abner's men 
were beaten; and when they were beaten, Joab did not leave off pursuing 
them, but he pressed upon them, and excited the soldiers to follow them 
close, and not to grow weary of killing them. His brethren also pursued 
them with great alacrity, especially the younger, Asahel, who was the 
most eminent of them. He was very famous for his swiftness of foot, for 
he could not only be too hard for men, but is reported to have overrun a
 horse, when they had a race together. This Asahel ran violently after 
Abner, and would not turn in the least out of the straight way, either 
to the one side or to the other. Hereupon Abner turned back, and 
attempted artfully to avoid his violence. Sometimes he bade him leave 
off the pursuit, and take the armor of one of his soldiers; and 
sometimes, when he could not persuade him so to do, he exhorted him to 
restrain himself, and not to pursue him any longer, lest he should force
 him to kill him, and he should then not be able to look his brother in 
the face: but when Asahel would not admit of any persuasions, but still 
continued to pursue him, Abner smote him with his spear, as he held it 
in his flight, and that by a back-stroke, and gave him a deadly wound, 
so that he died immediately; but those that were with him pursuing 
Abner, when they came to the place where Asahel lay, they stood round 
about the dead body, and left off the pursuit of the enemy. However, 
both Joab (1) himself, and his brother Abishai, ran past the dead 
corpse, and making their anger at the death of Asahel an occasion of 
greater zeal against Abner, they went on with incredible haste and 
alacrity, and pursued Abner to a certain place called Ammah: it was 
about sun-set. Then did Joab ascend a certain hill, as he stood at that 
place, having the tribe of Benjamin with him, whence he took a view of 
them, and of Abner also. Hereupon Abner cried aloud, and said that it 
was not fit that they should irritate men of the same nation to fight so
 bitterly one against another; that as for Asahel his brother, he was 
himself in the wrong, when he would not be advised by him not to pursue 
him any farther, which was the occasion of his wounding and death. So 
Joab consented to what he said, and accepted these his words as an 
excuse [about Asahel], and called the soldiers back with the sound of 
the trumpet, as a signal for their retreat, and thereby put a stop to 
any further pursuit. After which Joab pitched his camp there that night;
 but Abner marched all that night, and passed over the river Jordan, and
 came to Ishbosheth, Saul's son, to Mahanaim. On the next day Joab 
counted the dead men, and took care of all their funerals. Now there 
were slain of Abner's soldiers about three hundred and sixty; but of 
those of David nineteen, and Asahel, whose body Joab and Abishai carried
 to Bethlehem; and when they had buried him in the sepulcher of their 
fathers, they came to David to Hebron. From this time therefore there 
began an intestine war, which lasted a great while, in which the 
followers of David grew stronger in the dangers they underwent, and the 
servants and subjects of Saul's sons did almost every day become weaker.</p>
<p>4. About this time David was become the father of six sons, born of 
as many mothers. The eldest was by Ahinoam, and he was called Arenon; 
the second was Daniel, by his wife Abigail; the name of the third was 
Absalom, by Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur; the fourth 
he named Adonijah, by his wife Haggith; the fifth was Shephatiah, by 
Abital; the sixth he called Ithream, by Eglah. Now while this intestine 
war went on, and the subjects of the two kings came frequently to action
 and to fighting, it was Abner, the general of the host of Saul's son, 
who, by his prudence, and the great interest he had among the multitude,
 made them all continue with Ishbosheth; and indeed it was a 
considerable time that they continued of his party; but afterwards Abner
 was blamed, and an accusation was laid against him, that he went in 
unto Saul's concubine: her name was Rispah, the daughter of Aiah. So 
when he was complained of by Ishbosheth, he was very uneasy and angry at
 it, because he had not justice done him by Ishbosheth, to whom he had 
shown the greatest kindness; whereupon he threatened to transfer the 
kingdom to David, and demonstrate that he did not rule over the people 
beyond Jordan by his own abilities and wisdom, but by his warlike 
conduct and fidelity in leading his army. So he sent ambassadors to 
Hebron to David, and desired that he would give him security upon oath 
that he would esteem him his companion and his friend, upon condition 
that he should persuade the people to leave Saul's son, and choose him 
king of the whole country; and when David had made that league with 
Abner, for he was pleased with his message to him, he desired that he 
would give this as the first mark of performance of the present league, 
that he might have his wife Michal restored to him, as her whom he had 
purchased with great hazards, and with those six hundred heads of the 
Philistines which he had brought to Saul her father. So Abner took 
Michal from Phaltiel, who was then her husband, and sent her to David, 
Ishbosheth himself affording him his assistance, for David had written 
to him that of right he ought to have this his wife restored to him. 
Abner also called together the elders of the multitude, the commanders 
and captains of thousands, and spake thus to them: That he had <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="180" data-page-number="180" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/194"></span></span>formerly
 dissuaded them from their own resolution, when they were ready to 
forsake Ishbosheth, and to join themselves to David; that, however, he 
now gave them leave so to do, if they had a mind to it, for they knew 
that God had appointed David to be king of all the Hebrews by Samuel the
 prophet; and had foretold that he should punish the Philistines, and 
overcome them, and bring them under. Now when the elders and rulers 
heard this, and understood that Abner was come over to those sentiments 
about the public affairs which they were of before, they changed their 
measures, and came in to David. When these men had agreed to Abner's 
proposal, he called together the tribe of Benjamin, for all of that 
tribe were the guards of Ishbosheth's body, and he spake to them to the 
same purpose. And when he saw that they did not in the least oppose what
 he said, but resigned themselves up to his opinion, he took about 
twenty of his friends and came to David, in order to receive himself 
security upon oath from him; for we may justly esteem those things to be
 firmer which every one of us do by ourselves, than those which we do by
 another. He also gave him an account of what he had said to the rulers,
 and to the whole tribe of Benjamin; and when David had received him in a
 courteous manner, and had treated him with great hospitality for many 
days, Abner, when he was dismissed, desired him to bring the multitude 
with him, that he might deliver up the government to him, when David 
himself was present, and a spectator of what was done.</p>
<p>5. When David had sent Abner away, Joab, the of his army, came 
immediately to Hebron; he had understood that Abner had been with David,
 and had parted with him a little before under leagues and agreements 
that the government should be delivered up to David, he feared lest 
David should place Abner, who had assisted him to gain the kingdom, in 
the first rank of dignity, especially since he was a shrewd man in other
 respects, in understanding affairs, and in managing them artfully, as 
proper seasons should require, and that he should himself be put lower, 
and be deprived of the command of the army; so he took a knavish and a 
wicked course. In the first place, he endeavored to calumniate Abner to 
the king, exhorting him to have a care of him, and not to give attention
 to what he had engaged to do for him, because all he did tended to 
confirm the government to Saul's son; that he came to him deceitfully 
and with guile, and was gone away in hopes of gaining his purpose by 
this management: but when he could not thus persuade David, nor saw him 
at all exasperated, he betook himself to a project bolder than the 
former: - he determined to kill Abner; and in order thereto, he sent 
some messengers after him, to whom he gave in charge, that when they 
should overtake him they should recall him in David's name, and tell him
 that he had somewhat to say to him about his affairs, which he had not 
remembered to speak of when he was with him. Now when Abner heard what 
the messengers said, (for they overtook him in a certain place called 
Besira, which was distant from Hebron twenty furlongs,) he suspected 
none of the mischief which was befalling him, and came back. Hereupon 
Joab met him in the gate, and received him in the kindest manner, as if 
he were Abner's most benevolent acquaintance and friend; for such as 
undertake the vilest actions, in order to prevent the suspicion of any 
private mischief intended, do frequently make the greatest pretenses to 
what really good men sincerely do. So he took him aside from his own 
followers, as if he would speak with him in private, and brought him 
into a void place of the gate, having himself nobody with him but his 
brother Abishai; then he drew his sword, and smote him in the groin; 
upon which Abner died by this treachery of Joab, which, as he said 
himself, was in the way of punishment for his brother Asahel, whom Abner
 smote and slew as he was pursuing after him in the battle of Hebron, 
but as the truth was, out of his fear of losing his command of the army,
 and his dignity with the king, and lest he should be deprived of those 
advantages, and Abner should obtain the first rank in David's court. By 
these examples any one may learn how many and how great instances of 
wickedness men will venture upon for the sake of getting money and 
authority, and that they may not fail of either of them; for as when 
they are desirous of obtaining the same, they acquire them by ten 
thousand evil practices; so when they are afraid of losing them, they 
get them confirmed to them by practices much worse than the former, as 
if no other calamity so terrible could befall them as the failure of 
acquiring so exalted an authority; and when they have acquired it, and 
by long custom found the sweetness of it, the losing it again: and since
 this last would be the heaviest of all afflictions they all of them 
contrive and venture upon the most difficult actions, out of the fear of
 losing the same. But let it suffice that I have made these short 
reflections upon that subject.</p>
<p>6. When David heard that Abner was slain, it grieved his soul; and he
 called all men to witness, with stretching out his hands to God, and 
crying out that he was not a partaker in the murder of Abner, and that 
his death was not procured by his command or approbation. He also wished
 the heaviest curses might light upon him that slew him and upon his 
whole house; and he devoted those that had assisted him in this murder 
to the same penalties on its account; for he took care not to appear to 
have had any hand in this murder, contrary to the assurances he had 
given and the oaths he had taken to Abner. However, he commanded all the
 people to weep and lament this man, and to honor his dead body with the
 usual solemnities; that is, by rending their garments, and putting on 
sackcloth, and that things should be the habit in which they should go 
before the bier; after which he followed it himself, with the elders and
 those that were rulers, <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="181" data-page-number="181" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/195"></span></span>lamenting
 Abner, and by his tears demonstrating his good-will to him while he was
 alive, and his sorrow for him now he was dead, and that he was not 
taken off with his consent. So he buried him at Hebron in a magnificent 
manner, and indited funeral elegies for him; he also stood first over 
the monument weeping, and caused others to do the same; nay, so deeply 
did the death of Abner disorder him, that his companions could by no 
means force him to take any food, but he affirmed with an oath that he 
would taste nothing till the sun was set. This procedure gained him the 
good-will of the multitude; for such as had an affection for Abner were 
mightily satisfied with the respect he paid him when he was dead, and 
the observation of that faith he had plighted to him, which was shown in
 his vouchsafing him all the usual ceremonies, as if he had been his 
kinsman and his friend, and not suffering him to be neglected and 
injured with a dishonorable burial, as if he had been his enemy; 
insomuch that the entire nation rejoiced at the king's gentleness and 
mildness of disposition, every one being ready to suppose that the king 
would have taken the same care of them in the like circumstances, which 
they saw be showed in the burial of the dead body of Abner. And indeed 
David principally intended to gain a good reputation, and therefore he 
took care to do what was proper in this case, whence none had any 
suspicion that he was the author of Abner's death. He also said this to 
the multitude, that he was greatly troubled at the death of so good a 
man; and that the affairs of the Hebrews had suffered great detriment by
 being deprived of him, who was of so great abilities to preserve them 
by his excellent advice, and by the strength of his hands in war. But he
 added, that "God, who hath a regard to all men's actions, will not 
suffer this man [Joab] to go off unrevenged; but know ye, that I am not 
able to do any thing to these sons of Zeruiah, Joab and Abishai, who 
have more power than I have; but God will requite their insolent 
attempts upon their own heads." And this was the fatal conclusion of the
 life of Abner.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 2.</p>
<p>That Upon The Slaughter Of Ishbosheth By The Treachery Of His Friends, David Received The Whole Kingdom.</p>
<p>1. When Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, had heard of the death of Abner,
 he took it to heart to be deprived of a man that was of his kindred, 
and had indeed given him the kingdom, but was greatly afflicted, and 
Abner's death very much troubled him; nor did he himself outlive any 
long time, but was treacherously set upon by the sons of Rimmon, (Baanah
 and Rechab were their names,) and was slain by them; for these being of
 a family of the Benjamites, and of the first rank among them, thought 
that if they should slay Ishbosheth, they should obtain large presents 
from David, and be made commanders by him, or, however, should have some
 other trust committed to them. So when they once found him alone, and 
asleep at noon, in an upper room, when none of his guards were there, 
and when the woman that kept the door was not watching, but was fallen 
asleep also, partly on account of the labor she had undergone, and 
partly on account of the heat of the day, these men went into the room 
in which Ishbosheth, Saul's son, lay asleep, and slew him; they also cut
 off his head, and took their journey all that night, and the next day, 
as supposing themselves flying away from those they had injured, to one 
that would accept of this action as a favor, and would afford them 
security. So they came to Hebron, and showed David the head of 
Ishbosheth, and presented themselves to him as his well-wishers, and 
such as had killed one that was his enemy and antagonist. Yet David did 
not relish what they had done as they expected, but said to them, "You 
vile wretches, you shall immediately receive the punishment you deserve.
 Did not you know what vengeance I executed on him that murdered Saul, 
and brought me his crown of gold, and this while he who made this 
slaughter did it as a favor to him, that he might not be caught by his 
enemies? Or do you imagine that I am altered in my disposition, and 
suppose that I am not the same man I then was, but am pleased with men 
that are wicked doers, and esteem your vile actions, when you are become
 murderers of your master, as grateful to me, when you have slain a 
righteous man upon his bed, who never did evil to any body, and treated 
you with great good-will and respect? Wherefore you shall suffer the 
punishment due on his account, and the vengeance I ought to inflict upon
 you for killing Ishbosheth, and for supposing that I should take his 
death kindly at your hands; for you could not lay a greater blot on my 
honor, than by making such a supposal." When David had said this, he 
tormented them with all sorts of torments, and then put them to death; 
and he bestowed all accustomed rites on the burial of the head of 
Ishbosheth, and laid it in the grave of Abner.</p>
<p>2. When these things were brought to this conclusion, all the 
principal men of the Hebrew people came to David to Hebron, with the 
heads of thousands, and other rulers, and delivered themselves up to 
him, putting him in mind of the good-will they had borne to him in 
Saul's lifetime, and the respect they then had not ceased to pay him 
when he was captain of a thousand, as also that he was chosen of God by 
Samuel the prophet, he and his sons; <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="182" data-page-number="182" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/196"></span></span>(2)
 and declaring besides, how God had given him power to save the land of 
the Hebrews, and to overcome the Philistines. Whereupon he received 
kindly this their alacrity on his account; and exhorted them to continue
 in it, for that they should have no reason to repent of being thus 
disposed to him. So when he had feasted them, and treated them kindly, 
he sent them out to bring all the people to him; upon which came to him 
about six thousand and eight hundred armed men of the tribe of Judah, 
who bare shields and spears for their weapons, for these had [till now] 
continued with Saul's son, when the rest of the tribe of Judah had 
ordained David for their king. There came also seven thousand and one 
hundred out of the tribe of Simeon. Out of the tribe of Levi came four 
thousand and seven hundred, having Jehoiada for their leader. After 
these came Zadok the high priest, with twenty-two captains of his 
kindred. Out of the tribe of Benjamin the armed men were four thousand; 
but the rest of the tribe continued, still expecting that some one of 
the house of Saul should reign over them. Those of the tribe of Ephraim 
were twenty thousand and eight hundred, and these mighty men of valor, 
and eminent for their strength. Out of the half tribe of Manasseh came 
eighteen thousand, of the most potent men. Out of the tribe of Issachar 
came two hundred, who foreknew what was to come hereafter, (3) but of 
armed men twenty thousand. Of the tribe of Zebulon fifty thousand chosen
 men. This was the only tribe that came universally in to David, and all
 these had the same weapons with the tribe of Gad. Out of the tribe of 
Naphtali the eminent men and rulers were one thousand, whose weapons 
were shields and spears, and the tribe itself followed after, being (in a
 manner) innumerable [thirty-seven thousand]. Out of the tribe of Dan 
there were of chosen men twenty-seven thousand and six hundred. Out of 
the tribe of Asher were forty thousand. Out of the two tribes that were 
beyond Jordan, and the rest of the tribe of Manasseh, such as used 
shields, and spears, and head-pieces, and swords, were a hundred and 
twenty thousand. The rest of the tribes also made use of swords. This 
multitude came together to Hebron to David, with a great quantity of 
corn, and wine, and all other sorts of food, and established David in 
his kingdom with one consent. And when the people had rejoiced for three
 days in Hebron, David and all the people removed and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 3.</p>
<p>How David Laid Siege To Jerusalem; And When He Had Taken The City, He
 Cast The Canaanites Out Of It, And Brought In The Jews To Inhabit 
Therein.</p>
<p>1. Now the Jebusites, who were the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and were
 by extraction Canaanites, shut their gates, and placed the blind, and 
the lame, and all their maimed persons, upon the wall, in way of 
derision of the king, and said that the very lame themselves would 
hinder his entrance into it. This they did out of contempt of his power,
 and as depending on the strength of their walls. David was hereby 
enraged, and began the siege of Jerusalem, and employed his utmost 
diligence and alacrity therein, as intending by the taking of this place
 to demonstrate his power, and to intimidate all others that might be of
 the like [evil] disposition towards him. So he took the lower city by 
force, but the citadel held out still; (4) whence it was that the king, 
knowing that the proposal of dignities and rewards would encourage the 
soldiers to greater actions, promised that he who should first go over 
the ditches that were beneath the citadel, and should ascend to <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="183" data-page-number="183" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/197"></span></span>the
 citadel itself and take it, should have the command of the entire 
people conferred upon him. So they all were ambitious to ascend, and 
thought no pains too great in order to ascend thither, out of their 
desire of the chief command. However, Joab, the son of Zeruiah, 
prevented the rest; and as soon as he was got up to the citadel, cried 
out to the king, and claimed the chief command.</p>
<p>2. When David had cast the Jebusites out of the citadel, he also 
rebuilt Jerusalem, and named it The City of David, and abode there all 
the time of his reign; but for the time that he reigned over the tribe 
of Judah only in Hebron, it was seven years and six months. Now when he 
had chosen Jerusalem to be his royal city, his affairs did more and more
 prosper, by the providence of God, who took care that they should 
improve and be augmented. Hiram also, the king of the Tyrians, sent 
ambassadors to him, and made a league of mutual friendship and 
assistance with him. He also sent him presents, cedar-trees, and 
mechanics, and men skillful in building and architecture, that they 
might build him a royal palace at Jerusalem. Now David made buildings 
round about the lower city: he also joined the citadel to it, and made 
it one body; and when he had encompassed all with walls, he appointed 
Joab to take care of them. It was David, therefore, who first cast the 
Jebusites out of Jerusalem, and called it by his own name, The City of 
David: for under our forefather Abraham it was called (Salem, or) 
Solyma; (5) but after that time, some say that Homer mentions it by that
 name of Solyma, [for he named the temple Solyma, according to the 
Hebrew language, which denotes security.] Now the whole time from the 
warfare under Joshua our general against the Canaanites, and from that 
war in which he overcame them, and distributed the land among the 
Hebrews, (nor could the Israelites ever cast the Canaanites out of 
Jerusalem until this time, when David took it by siege,) this whole time
 was five hundred and fifteen years.</p>
<p>3. I shall now make mention of Araunah, who was a wealthy man among 
the Jebusites, but was not slain by David in the siege of Jerusalem, 
because of the good-will he bore to the Hebrews, and a particular 
benignity and affection which he had to the king himself; which I shall 
take a more seasonable opportunity to speak of a little afterwards. Now 
David married other wives over and above those which he had before: he 
had also concubines. The sons whom he had were in number eleven, whose 
names were Amnon, Emnos, Eban, Nathan, Solomon, Jeban, Elien, Phalna, 
Ennaphen, Jenae, Eliphale; and a daughter, Tamar. Nine of these were 
born of legitimate wives, but the two last-named of concubines; and 
Tamar had the same mother with Absalom.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 4.</p>
<p>That When David Had Conquered The Philistines Who Made War Against 
Him At Jerusalem, He Removed The Ark To Jerusalem And Had A Mind To 
Build A Temple.</p>
<p>1. When the Philistines understood that David was made king of the 
Hebrews, they made war against him at Jerusalem; and when they had 
seized upon that valley which is called The Valley of the Giants, and is
 a place not far from the city, they pitched their camp therein; but the
 king of the Jews, who never permitted himself to do any thing without 
prophecy, (6) and the command of God and without depending on him as a 
security for the time to come, bade the high priest to foretell to him 
what was the will of God, and what would be the event of this battle. 
And when he foretold that he should gain the victory and the dominion, 
he led out his army against the Philistines; and when the battle was 
joined, he came himself behind, and fell upon the enemy on the sudden, 
and slew some of them, and put the rest to flight. And let no one 
suppose that it was a small army of the Philistines that came against 
the Hebrews, as guessing so from <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="184" data-page-number="184" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/198"></span></span>the
 suddenness of their defeat, and from their having performed no great 
action, or that was worth recording, from the slowness of their march, 
and want of courage; but let him know that all Syria and Phoenicia, with
 many other nations besides them, and those warlike nations also, came 
to their assistance, and had a share in this war, which thing was the 
only cause why, when they had been so often conquered, and had lost so 
many ten thousands of their men, they still came upon the Hebrews with 
greater armies; nay, indeed, when they had so often failed of their 
purpose in these battles, they came upon David with an army three times 
as numerous as before, and pitched their camp on the same spot of ground
 as before. The king of Israel therefore inquired of God again 
concerning the event of the battle; and the high priest prophesied to 
him, that he should keep his army in the groves, called the Groves of 
Weeping, which were not far from the enemy's camp, and that he should 
not move, nor begin to fight, till the trees of the grove should be in 
motion without the wind's blowing; but as soon as these trees moved, and
 the time foretold to him by God was come, he should, without delay, go 
out to gain what was an already prepared and evident victory; for the 
several ranks of the enemy's army did not sustain him, but retreated at 
the first onset, whom he closely followed, and slew them as he went 
along, and pursued them to the city Gaza (which is the limit of their 
country): after this he spoiled their camp, in which he found great 
riches; and he destroyed their gods.</p>
<p>2. When this had proved the event of the battle, David thought it 
proper, upon a consultation with the elders, and rulers, and captains of
 thousands, to send for those that were in the flower of their age out 
of all his countrymen, and out of the whole land, and withal for the 
priests and the Levites, in order to their going to Kirjathjearim, to 
bring up the ark of God out of that city, and to carry it to Jerusalem, 
and there to keep it, and offer before it those sacrifices and those 
other honors with which God used to be well-pleased; for had they done 
thus in the reign of Saul, they had not undergone any great misfortunes 
at all. So when the whole body of the people were come together, as they
 had resolved to do, the king came to the ark, which the priest brought 
out of the house of Aminadab, and laid it upon a new cart, and permitted
 their brethren and their children to draw it, together with the oxen. 
Before it went the king, and the whole multitude of the people with him,
 singing hymns to God, and making use of all sorts of songs usual among 
them, with variety of the sounds of musical instruments, and with 
dancing and singing of psalms, as also with the sounds of trumpets and 
of cymbals, and so brought the ark to Jerusalem. But as they were come 
to the threshing-floor of Chidon, a place so called, Uzzah was slain by 
the anger of God; for as the oxen shook the ark, he stretched out his 
hand, and would needs take hold of it. Now, because he was not a priest 
(7) and yet touched the ark, God struck him dead. Hereupon both the king
 and the people were displeased at the death of Uzzah; and the place 
where he died is still called the Breach of Uzzah unto this day. So 
David was afraid; and supposing that if he received the ark to himself 
into the city, he might suffer in the like manner as Uzzah had suffered,
 who, upon his bare putting out his hand to the ark, died in the manner 
already mentioned, he did not receive it to himself into the city, but 
he took it aside unto a certain place belonging to a righteous man, 
whose name was Obededom, who was by his family a Levite, and deposited 
the ark with him; and it remained there three entire months. This 
augmented the house of Obededom, and conferred many blessings upon it. 
And when the king heard what had befallen Obededom, how he was become, 
of a poor man in a low estate, exceeding happy, and the object of envy 
to all those that saw or inquired after his house, he took courage, and,
 hoping that he should meet with no misfortune thereby, he transferred 
the ark to his own house; the priests carrying it, while seven companies
 of singers, who were set in that order by the king, went before it, and
 while he himself played upon the harp, and joined in the music, 
insomuch, that when his wife Michel, the daughter of Saul, who was our 
first king, saw him so doing, she laughed at him. But when they had 
brought in the ark, they placed it under the tabernacle which David had 
pitched for it, and he offered costly sacrifices and peace-offerings, 
and treated the whole multitude, and dealt both to the women, and the 
men, and the infants a loaf of bread and a cake, and another cake baked 
in a pan, with the portion of the sacrifice. So when he had thus feasted
 the people, he sent them away, and he himself returned to his own 
house.</p>
<p>3. But when Michal his wife, the daughter of Saul, came and stood by 
him, she wished him all other happiness, and entreated that whatsoever 
he should further desire, to the utmost possibility, might be given him 
by God, and that he might be favorable to him; yet did she blame him, 
that so great a king as he was should dance after an unseemly manner, 
and in his dancing, uncover himself among the servants and the 
handmaidens. But <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="185" data-page-number="185" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/199"></span></span>he
 replied, that he was not ashamed to do what was acceptable to God, who 
had preferred him before her father, and before all others; that he 
would play frequently, and dance, without any regard to what the 
handmaidens and she herself thought of it. So this Michal, who was 
David's wife, had no children; however, when she was afterward married 
to him to whom Saul her father had given her, (for at this time David 
had taken her away from him, and had her himself,) she bare five 
children. But concerning those matters I shall discourse in a proper 
place.</p>
<p>4. Now when the king saw that his affairs grew better almost every 
day, by the will of God, he thought he should offend him, if, while he 
himself continued in houses made of cedar, such as were of a great 
height, and had the most curious works of architecture in them, he 
should overlook the ark while it was laid in a tabernacle, and was 
desirous to build a temple to God, as Moses had predicted such a temple 
should be built. (8) And when he had discoursed with Nathan the prophet 
about these things, and had been encouraged by him to do whatsoever he 
had a mind to do, as having God with him, and his helper in all things, 
he was thereupon the more ready to set about that building. But God 
appeared to Nathan that very night, and commanded him to say to David, 
(9) that he took his purpose and his desires kindly, since nobody had 
before now taken it into their head to build him a temple, although upon
 his having such a notion he would not permit him to build him that 
temple, because he had made many wars, and was defiled with the 
slaughter of his enemies; that, however, after his death, in his old 
age, and when he had lived a long life, there should be a temple built 
by a son of his, who should take the kingdom after him, and should be 
called Solomon, whom he promised to provide for, as a father provides 
for his son, by preserving the kingdom for his son's posterity, and 
delivering it to them; but that he would still punish him, if he sinned,
 with diseases and barrenness of land. When David understood this from 
the prophet, and was overjoyful at this knowledge of the sure 
continuance of the dominion to his posterity, and that his house should 
be splendid, and very famous, he came to the ark, and fell down on his 
face, and began to adore God, and to return thanks to him for all his 
benefits, as well for those that he had already bestowed upon him in 
raising him from a low state, and from the employment of a shepherd, to 
so great dignity of dominion and glory; as for those also which he had 
promised to his posterity; and besides, for that providence which he had
 exercised over the Hebrews in procuring them the liberty they enjoyed. 
And when he had said thus, and had sung a hymn of praise to God, he went
 his way.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 5.</p>
<p>How David Brought Under The Philistines, And The Moabites, And The 
Kings Of Sophene And Of Damascus, And Of The Syrians As Also The 
Idumeans, In War; And How He Made A League With The King Of Hamath; And 
Was Mindful Of The Friendship That Jonathan, The Son Of Saul, Had Borne 
Him.</p>
<p>1. A Litlle while after this, he considered that he ought to make war
 against the Philistines, and not to see any idleness or laziness 
permitted in his management, that so it might prove, as God had foretold
 to him, that when he had overthrown his enemies, he should leave his 
posterity to reign in peace afterward: so he called together his army 
again, and when he had charged them to be ready and prepared for war, 
and when he thought that all things in his army were in a good state, he
 removed from Jerusalem, and came against the Philistines; and when he 
had overcome them in battle, and had cut off a great part of their 
country, and adjoined it to the country of the Hebrews, he transferred 
the war to the Moabites; and when he had overcome two parts of their 
army in battle, he took the remaining part captive, and imposed tribute 
upon them, to be paid annually. He then made war against Iadadezer, the 
son of Rehob, king of Sophene; (10) and when he had joined battle with 
him at 'the river Euphrates, he destroyed twenty thousand of his 
footmen, and about seven thousand of his horsemen. He also took a 
thousand of his chariots, and destroyed the greatest part of them, and 
ordered that no more than one hundred should be kept. (11) <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="186" data-page-number="186" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/200"></span></span></p>
<p><br>
2. Now when Hadad, king of Damascus and of Syria, heard that David 
fought against Hadadezer, who was his friend, he came to his assistance 
with a powerful army, in hopes to rescue him; and when he had joined 
battle with David at the river Euphrates, he failed of his purpose, and 
lost in the battle a great number of his soldiers; for there were slain 
of the army of Hadad twenty thousand, and all the rest fled. Nicelens 
also [of Damascus] makes mention of this king in the fourth book of his 
histories; where he speaks thus: "A great while after these things had 
happened, there was one of that country whose name was Hadad, who was 
become very potent; he reigned over Damascus, and, the other parts of 
Syria, excepting Phoenicia. He made war against David, the king of 
Judea, and tried his fortune in many battles, and particularly in the 
last battle at Euphrates, wherein he was beaten. He seemed to have been 
the most excellent of all their kings in strength and manhood," Nay, 
besides this, he says of his posterity, that "they succeeded one another
 in his kingdom, and in his name;" where he thus speaks: "When Hadad was
 dead, his posterity reigned for ten generations, each of his successors
 receiving from his father that his dominion, and this his name; as did 
the Ptolemies in Egypt. But the third was the most powerful of them all,
 and was willing to avenge the defeat his forefather had received; so he
 made an expedition against the Jews, and laid waste the city which is 
now called Samaria." Nor did he err from the truth; for this is that 
Hadad who made the expedition against Samaria, in the reign of Ahab, 
king of Israel, concerning whom we shall speak in due place hereafter.</p>
<p>3. Now when David had made an expedition against Damascus, and the 
other parts of Syria, and had brought it all into subjection, and had 
placed garrisons in the country, and appointed that they should pay 
tribute, he returned home. He also dedicated to God at Jerusalem the 
golden quivers, the entire armor which the guards of Hadad used to wear;
 which Shishak, the king of Egypt, took away when he fought with David's
 grandson, Rehoboam, with a great deal of other wealth which he carried 
out of Jerusalem. However, these things will come to be explained in 
their proper places hereafter. Now as for the king of the Hebrews, he 
was assisted by God, who gave him great success in his wars, and he made
 all expedition against the best cities of Hadadezer, Betah and Machen; 
so he took them by force, and laid them waste. Therein was found a very 
great quantity of gold and silver, besides that sort of brass which is 
said to be more valuable than gold; of which brass Solomon made that 
large vessel which was called The [Brazen] Sea, and those most curious 
lavers, when he built the temple for God.</p>
<p>4. But when the king of Hamath was informed of the ill success of 
Hadadezer, and had heard of the ruin of his army, he was afraid on his 
own account, and resolved to make a league of friendship and fidelity 
with David before he should come against him; so he sent to him his son 
Joram, and professed that he owed him thanks for fighting against 
Hadadezer, who was his enemy, and made a league with him of mutual 
assistance and friendship. He also sent him presents, vessels of ancient
 workmanship, both of gold, of silver, and of brass. So when David had 
made this league of mutual assistance with Toi, (for that was the name 
of the king of Hamath,) and had received the presents he sent him, he 
dismissed his son with that respect which was due on both sides; but 
then David brought those presents that were sent by him, as also the 
rest of the gold and silver which he had taken of the cities whom he had
 conquered, and dedicated them to God. Nor did God give victory and 
success to him only when he went to the battle himself, and led his own 
army, but he gave victory to Abishai, the brother of Joab, general of 
his forces, over the Idumeans, (12) and by him to David, when he sent 
him with an army into Idumea: for Abishai destroyed eighteen thousand of
 them in the battle; whereupon the king [of Israel] placed garrisons 
through all Idumea, and received the tribute of the country, and of 
every head among them. Now David was in his nature just, and made his 
determination with regard to truth. He had for the general of his <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="187" data-page-number="187" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/201"></span></span>whole
 army Joab; and he made Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, recorder. He 
also appointed Zadok, of the family of Phinehas, to be high priest, 
together with Abiathar, for he was his friend. He also made Seisan the 
scribe, and committed the command over the guards of his body to 
Benaiah; the son of Jehoiada. His elder sons were near his body, and had
 the care of it also.</p>
<p>5. He also called to mind the covenants and the oaths he had made 
with Jonathan, the son of Saul, and the friendship and affection 
Jonathan had for him; for besides all the rest of his excellent 
qualities with which he was endowed, he was also exceeding mindful of 
such as had at other times bestowed benefits upon him. He therefore gave
 order that inquiry should be made, whether any of Jonathan's lineage 
were living, to whom he might make return of that familiar acquaintance 
which Jonathan had had with him, and for which he was still debtor. And 
when one of Saul's freed men was brought to him, who was acquainted with
 those of his family that were still living, he asked him whether he 
could tell him of any one belonging to Jonathan that was now alive, and 
capable of a requital of the benefits which he had received from 
Jonathan. And he said, that a son of his was remaining, whose name was 
Mephibosheth, but that he was lame of his feet; for that when his nurse 
heard that the father and grandfather of the child were fallen in the 
battle, she snatched him up, and fled away, and let him fall from her 
shoulders, and his feet were lamed. So when he had learned where and by 
whom he was brought up, he sent messengers to Machir, to the city of 
Lodebar, for with him was the son of Jonathan brought up, and sent for 
him to come to him. So when Mephibosheth came to the king, he fell on 
his face and worshipped him; but David encouraged him, bade him be of 
good cheer, and expect better times. So he gave him his father's house, 
and all the estate which his grandfather Saul was in possession of, and 
bade him come and diet with him at his own table, and never to be absent
 one day from that table. And when the youth had worshipped him on 
account of his words and gifts given to him, he called for Ziba, and 
told him that he had given the youth his father's house, and all Saul's 
estate. He also ordered that Ziba should cultivate his land, and take 
care of it, and bring him the profits of all to Jerusalem. Accordingly, 
David brought him to his table every day, and bestowed upon the youth, 
Ziba and his sons, who were in number fifteen, and his servants, who 
were in number twenty. When the king had made these appointments, and 
Ziba had worshipped him, and promised to do all that he had bidden him, 
he went his way; so that this son of Jonathan dwelt at Jerusalem, and 
dieted at the king's table, and had the same care that a son could claim
 taken of him. He also had himself a son, whom he named Micha.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 6.</p>
<p>How The War Was Waged Against The Ammonites And Happily Concluded.</p>
<p>1. This were the honors that such as were left of Saul's and 
Jonathan's lineage received from David. About this time died Nahash, the
 king of the Ammonites, who was a friend of David's; and when his son 
had succeeded his father in the kingdom, David sent ambassadors to him 
to comfort him; and exhorted him to take his father's death patiently, 
and to expect that he would continue the same kindness to himself which 
he had shown to his father. But the princes of the Ammonites took this 
message in evil part, and not as David's kind dispositions gave reason 
to take it; and they excited the king to resent it; and said that David 
had sent men to spy out the country, and what strength it had, under the
 pretense of humanity and kindness. They further advised him to have a 
care, and not to give heed to David's words, lest he should be deluded 
by him, and so fall into an inconsolable calamity. Accordingly Nahash's 
[son], the king of the Ammonites, thought these princes spake what was 
more probable than the truth would admit, and so abused the ambassadors 
after a very harsh manner; for he shaved the one half of their beards, 
and cut off one half of their garments, and sent his answer, not in 
words, but in deeds. When the king of Israel saw this, he had 
indignation at it, and showed openly that he would not overlook this 
injurious and contumelious treatment, but would make war with the 
Ammonites, and would avenge this wicked treatment of his ambassadors on 
their king. So that king's intimate friends and commanders, 
understanding that they had violated their league, and were liable to be
 punished for the same, made preparations for war; they also sent a 
thousand talents to the Syrian king of Mesopotamia, and endeavored to 
prevail with him to assist them for that pay, and Shobach. Now these 
kings had twenty thousand footmen. They also hired the king of the 
country called Maacah, and a fourth king, by name Ishtob; which last had
 twelve thousand armed men.</p>
<p>2. But David was under no consternation at this confederacy, nor at 
the forces of the Ammonites; and putting his trust in God, because he 
was going to war in a just cause, on account of the injurious treatment 
he had met with, he immediately sent Joab, the captain of his host, 
against them, and gave him the flower of his army, who pitched his camp 
by Rabbah, the metropolis of the Ammonites; whereupon the enemy came 
out, and set themselves in array, not all of them together, but in two 
bodies; for the auxiliaries were set in array in the plain by 
themselves, but the army of the Ammonites at the gates over against the 
Hebrews. When Joab saw this, he opposed one stratagem against another, 
and chose out the <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="188" data-page-number="188" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/202"></span></span>most
 hardy part of his men, and set them in opposition to the king of Syria,
 and the kings that were with him, and gave the other part to his 
brother Abishai, and bid him set them in opposition to the Ammonites; 
and said to him, that in case he should see that the Syrians distressed 
him, and were too hard for him, he should order his troops to turn about
 and assist him; and he said that he himself would do the same to him, 
if he saw him in the like distress from the Ammonites. So he sent his 
brother before, and encouraged him to do every thing courageously and 
with alacrity, which would teach them to be afraid of disgrace, and to 
fight manfully; and so he dismissed him to fight with the Ammonites, 
while he fell upon the Syrians. And though they made a strong opposition
 for a while, Joab slew many of them, but compelled the rest to betake 
themselves to flight; which, when the Ammonites saw, and were withal 
afraid of Abishai and his army, they staid no longer, but imitated their
 auxiliaries, and fled to the city. So Joab, when he had thus overcome 
the enemy, returned with great joy to Jerusalem to the king.</p>
<p>3. This defeat did not still induce the Ammonites to be quiet, nor to
 own those that were superior to them to be so, and be still, but they 
sent to Chalaman, the king of the Syrians, beyond Euphrates, and hired 
him for an auxiliary. He had Shobach for the captain of his host, with 
eighty thousand footmen, and ten thousand horsemen. Now when the king of
 the Hebrews understood that the Ammonites had again gathered so great 
an army together, he determined to make war with them no longer by his 
generals, but he passed over the river Jordan himself with all his army;
 and when he met them he joined battle with them, and overcame them, and
 slew forty thousand of their footmen, and seven thousand of their 
horsemen. He also wounded Shobach, the general of Chalaman's forces, who
 died of that stroke; but the people of Mesopotamia, upon such a 
conclusion of the battle, delivered themselves up to David, and sent him
 presents, who at winter time returned to Jerusalem. But at the 
beginning of the spring he sent Joab, the captain of his host, to fight 
against the Ammonites, who overran all their country, and laid it waste,
 and shut them up in their metropolis Rabbah, and besieged them therein.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 7.</p>
<p>How David Fell In Love With Bathsheba, And Slew Her Husband Uriah, For Which He Is Reproved By Nathan.</p>
<p>1. But David fell now into a very grievous sin, though he were 
otherwise naturally a righteous and a religious man, and one that firmly
 observed the laws of our fathers; for when late in an evening he took a
 view round him from the roof of his royal palace, where he used to walk
 at that hour, he saw a woman washing herself in her own house: she was 
one of extraordinary beauty, and therein surpassed all other women; her 
name was Bathsheba. So he was overcome by that woman's beauty, and was 
not able to restrain his desires, but sent for her, and lay with her. 
Hereupon she conceived with child, and sent to the king, that he should 
contrive some way for concealing her sin (for, according to the laws of 
their fathers, she who had been guilty of adultery ought to be put to 
death). So the king sent for Joab's armor-bearer from the siege, who was
 the woman's husband, and his name was Uriah. And when he was come, the 
king inquired of him about the army, and about the siege; and when he 
had made answer that all their affairs went according to their wishes, 
the king took some portions of meat from his supper, and gave them to 
him, and bade him go home to his wife, and take his rest with her. Uriah
 did not do so, but slept near the king with the rest of his 
armor-bearers. When the king was informed of this, he asked him why he 
did not go home to his house, and to his wife, after so long an absence;
 which is the natural custom of all men, when they come from a long 
journey. He replied, that it was not right, while his fellow soldiers, 
and the general of the army, slept upon the ground, in the camp, and in 
an enemy's country, that he should go and take his rest, and solace 
himself with his wife. So when he had thus replied, the king ordered him
 to stay there that night, that he might dismiss him the next day to the
 general. So the king invited Uriah to supper, and after a cunning and 
dexterous manlier plied him with drink at supper, till he was thereby 
disordered; yet did he nevertheless sleep at the king's gates without 
any inclination to go to his wife. Upon this the king was very angry at 
him; and wrote to Joab, and commanded him to punish Uriah, for he told 
him that he had offended him; and he suggested to him the manner in 
which he would have him punished, that it might not be discovered that 
he was himself the author of this his punishment; for he charged him to 
set him over against that part of the enemy's army where the attack 
would be most hazardous, and where he might be deserted, and be in the 
greatest jeopardy, for he bade him order his fellow soldiers to retire 
out of the fight. When he had written thus to him, and sealed the letter
 with his own seal, he gave it to Uriah to carry to Joab. When Joab had 
received it, and upon reading it understood the king's purpose, he set 
Uriah in that place where he knew the enemy would be most troublesome to
 them; and gave him for his partners some of the best soldiers in the 
army; and said that he would also come to their assistance with the 
whole army, that if possible they might break down some part of the 
wall, and enter the city. And he desired him to be glad of the 
opportunity of exposing hims <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="189" data-page-number="189" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/203"></span></span>elf
 to such great pains, and not to be displeased at it, since he was a 
valiant soldier, and had a great reputation for his valor, both with the
 king and with his countrymen. And when Uriah undertook the work he was 
set upon with alacrity, he gave private orders to those who were to be 
his companions, that when they saw the enemy make a sally, they should 
leave him. When, therefore, the Hebrews made an attack upon the city, 
the Ammonites were afraid that the enemy might prevent them, and get up 
into the city, and this at the very place whither Uriah was ordered; so 
they exposed their best soldiers to be in the forefront, and opened 
their gates suddenly, and fell upon the enemy with great vehemence, and 
ran violently upon them. When those that were with Uriah saw this, they 
all retreated backward, as Joab had directed them beforehand; but Uriah,
 as ashamed to run away and leave his post, sustained the enemy, and 
receiving the violence of their onset, he slew many of them; but being 
encompassed round, and caught in the midst of them, he was slain, and 
some other of his companions were slain with him.</p>
<p>2. When this was done, Joab sent messengers to the king, and ordered 
them to tell him that he did what he could to take the city soon; but 
that, as they made an assault on the wall, they had been forced to 
retire with great loss; and bade them, if they saw the king was angry at
 it, to add this, that Uriah was slain also. When the king had heard 
this of the messengers, he took it heinously, and said that they did 
wrong when they assaulted the wall, whereas they ought, by undermining 
and other stratagems of war, to endeavor the taking of rite city, 
especially when they had before their eyes the example of Abimelech, the
 son of Gideon, who would needs take the tower in Thebes by force, and 
was killed by a large stone thrown at him by an old woman; and although 
he was a man of great prowess, he died ignominiously by the dangerous 
manner of his assault: that they should remember this accident, and not 
come near the enemy's wall, for that the best method of making war with 
success was to call to mind the accidents of former wars, and what good 
or bad success had attended them in the like dangerous cases, that so 
they might imitate the one, and avoid the other. But when the king was 
in this disposition, the messenger told him that Uriah was slain also; 
whereupon he was pacified. So he bade the messenger go back to Joab and 
tell him that this misfortune is no other than what is common among 
mankind, and that such is the nature, and such the accidents of war, 
insomuch that sometimes the enemy will have success therein, and 
sometimes others; but that he ordered him to go on still in his care 
about the siege, that no ill accident might befall him in it hereafter; 
that they should raise bulwarks and use machines in besieging the city; 
and when they have gotten it, to overturn its very foundations, and to 
destroy all those that are in it. Accordingly the messenger carried the 
king's message with which he was charged, and made haste to Joab. But 
Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, when she was informed of the death of her 
husband, mourned for his death many days; and when her mourning was 
over, and the tears which she shed for Uriah were dried up, the king 
took her to wife presently; and a son was born to him by her.</p>
<p>3. With this marriage God was not well pleased, but was thereupon 
angry at David; and he appeared to Nathan the prophet in his sleep, and 
complained of the king. Now Nathan was a fair and prudent man; and 
considering that kings, when they fall into a passion, are guided more 
by that passion than they are by justice, he resolved to conceal the 
threatenings that proceeded from God, and made a good-natured discourse 
to him, and this after the manner following: - He desired that the king 
would give him his opinion in the following case: - There were," said 
he, "two men inhabiting the same city, the one of them was rich, and 
[the other poor]. The rich man had a great many flocks of cattle, of 
sheep, and of kine; but the poor man had but one ewe lamb. This he 
brought up with his children, and let her eat her food with them; and he
 had the same natural affection for her which any one might have for a 
daughter. Now upon the coming of a stranger to the rich man, he would 
not vouchsafe to kill any of his own flocks, and thence feast his 
friend; but he sent for the poor man's lamb, and took her away from him,
 and made her ready for food, and thence feasted the stranger." This 
discourse troubled the king exceedingly; and he denounced to Nathan, 
that "this man was a wicked man who could dare to do such a thing; and 
that it was but just that he should restore the lamb fourfold, and be 
punished with death for it also." Upon this Nathan immediately said that
 he was himself the man who ought to suffer those punishments, and that 
by his own sentence; and that it was he who had perpetrated this 'great 
and horrid crime. He also revealed to him, and laid before him, the 
anger of God against him, who had made him king over the army of the 
Hebrews, and lord of all the nations, and those many and great nations 
round about him; who had formerly delivered him out of the hands of 
Saul, and had given him such wives as he had justly and legally married;
 and now this God was despised by him, and affronted by his impiety, 
when he had married, and now had, another man's wife; and by exposing 
her husband to the enemy, had really slain him; 'that God would inflict 
punishments upon him on account of those instances of wickedness; that 
his own wives should be forced by one of his sons; and that he should be
 treacherously supplanted by the same son; and that although he had 
perpetrated <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="190" data-page-number="190" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/204"></span></span>his
 wickedness secretly, yet should that punishment which he was to undergo
 be inflicted publicly upon him; "that, moreover," said he, "the child 
which was born to thee of her shall soon die." When the king was 
troubled at these messages, and sufficiently confounded, and said with 
tears and sorrow that he had sinned, (for he was without controversy a 
pious man, and guilty of no sin at all in his whole life, excepting 
those in the matter of Uriah,) God had compassion on him, and was 
reconciled to him, and promised that he would preserve to him both his 
life and his kingdom; for he said that, seeing he repented of the things
 he had done, he was no longer displeased with him. So Nathan, when he 
had delivered this prophecy to the king, returned home.</p>
<p>4. However, God sent a dangerous distemper upon the child that was 
born to David of the wife of Uriah, at which the king was troubled, and 
did not take any food for seven days, although his servants almost 
forced him to take it; but he clothed himself in a black garment, and 
fell down, and lay upon the ground in sackcloth, entrusting God for the 
recovery of the child, for he vehemently loved the child's mother; but 
when, on the seventh day, the child was dead, the king's servants durst 
not tell him of it, as supposing that when he knew it, he would still 
less admit of food, and other care of himself, by reason of his grief at
 the death of his son, since when the child was only sick, he so greatly
 afflicted himself, and grieved for him: but when the king perceived 
that his servants were in disorder, and seemed to be affected, as those 
who are very desirous to conceal something, he understood that the child
 was dead; and when he had called one of his servants to him, and 
discovered that so it was, he arose up and washed himself, and took a 
white garment, and came into the tabernacle of God. He also commanded 
them to set supper before him, and thereby greatly surprised his kindred
 and servants, while he did nothing of this when the child was sick, but
 did it all when he was dead. Whereupon having first begged leave to ask
 him a question, they besought him to tell them the reason of this his 
conduct; he then called them unskillful people, and instructed them how 
he had hopes of the recovery of the child while it was alive, and 
accordingly did all that was proper for him to do, as thinking by such 
means to render God propitious to him; but that when the child was dead,
 there was no longer any occasion for grief, which was then to no 
purpose. When he had said this, they commended the king's wisdom and 
understanding. He then went in unto Bathsheba his wife, and she 
conceived and bare a son; and by the command of Nathan the prophet 
called his name Solomon.</p>
<p>5. But Joab sorely distressed the Ammonites in the siege, by cutting 
off their waters, and depriving them of other means of subsistence, till
 they were in the greatest want of meat and drink, for they depended 
only on one small well of water, and this they durst not drink of too 
freely, lest the fountain should entirely fail them. So he wrote to the 
king, and informed him thereof; and persuaded him to come himself to 
take the city, that he might have the honor of the victory. Upon this 
letter of Joab's, the king accepted of his good-will and fidelity, and 
took with him his army, and came to the destruction of Rabbah; and when 
he had taken it by force, he gave it to his soldiers to plunder it; but 
he himself took the king of the Ammonites' crown, whose weight was a 
talent of gold; (13) and it had in its middle a precious stone called a 
sardonyx; which crown David ever after wore on his own head. He also 
found many other vessels in the city, and those both splendid and of 
great price; but as for the men, he tormented them, (14) and then 
destroyed them; and when he had taken the other cities of the Ammonites 
by force, he treated them after the same manner.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 8.</p>
<p>How Absalom Murdered Amnon, Who Had Forced His Own Sister; And How He Was Banished And Afterwards Recalled By David.</p>
<p>1. When the king was returned to Jerusalem, a sad misfortune befell 
his house, on the occasion following: He had a daughter, who was yet a 
virgin, and very handsome, insomuch <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="191" data-page-number="191" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/205"></span></span>that
 she surpassed all the most beautiful women; her name was Tamar; she had
 the same mother with Absalom. Now Amnon, David's eldest son, fell in 
love with her, and being not able to obtain his desires, on account of 
her virginity, and the custody she was under, was so much out of order, 
nay, his grief so eat up his body, that he grew lean, and his color was 
changed. Now there was one Jenadab, a kinsman and friend of his, who 
discovered this his passion, for he was an extraordinary wise man, and 
of great sagacity of mind. When, therefore, he saw that every morning 
Amnon was not in body as he ought to be, he came to him, and desired him
 to tell him what was the cause of it: however, he said that he guessed 
that it arose from the passion of love. Amnon confessed his passion, 
that he was in love with a sister of his, who had the same father with 
himself. So Jenadab suggested to him by what method and contrivance he 
might obtain his desires; for he persuaded him to pretend sickness, and 
bade him, when his father should come to him, to beg of him that his 
sister might come and minister to him; for if that were done, he should 
be better, and should quickly recover from his distemper. So Amnon lay 
down on his bed, and pretended to be sick, as Jonadab had suggested. 
When his father came, and inquired how he did, he begged of him to send 
his sister to him. Accordingly, he presently ordered her to be brought 
to him; and when she was come, Amnon bade her make cakes for him, and 
fry them in a pan, and do it all with her own hands, because he should 
take them better from her hand [than from any one's else]. So she 
kneaded the flour in the sight of her brother, and made him cakes, and 
baked them in a pan, and brought them to him; but at that time he would 
not taste them, but gave order to his servants to send all that were 
there out of his chamber, because he had a mind to repose himself, free 
from tumult and disturbance. As soon as what he had commanded was done, 
he desired his sister to bring his supper to him into the inner parlor; 
which, when the damsel had done, he took hold of her, and endeavored to 
persuade her to lie with him. Whereupon the damsel cried out, and said, 
"Nay, brother, do not force me, nor be so wicked as to transgress the 
laws, and bring upon thyself the utmost confusion. Curb this thy 
unrighteous and impure lust, from which our house will get nothing but 
reproach and disgrace." She also advised him to speak to his father 
about this affair; for he would permit him [to marry her]. This she 
said, as desirous to avoid her brother's violent passion at present. But
 he would not yield to her; but, inflamed with love and blinded with the
 vehemency of his passion, he forced his sister: but as soon as Amnon 
had satisfied his lust, he hated her immediately, and giving her 
reproachful words, bade her rise up and be gone. And when she said that 
this was a more injurious treatment than the former, if, now he had 
forced her, he would not let her stay with him till the evening, but bid
 her go away in the day-time, and while it was light, that she might 
meet with people that would be witnesses of her shame, - he commanded 
his servant to turn her out of his house. Whereupon she was sorely 
grieved at the injury and violence that had been offered to her, and 
rent her loose coat, (for the virgins of old time wore such loose coats 
tied at the hands, and let down to the ankles, that the inner coats 
might not be seen,) and sprinkled ashes on her head; and went up the 
middle of the city, crying out and lamenting for the violence that had 
been offered her. Now Absalom, her brother, happened to meet her, and 
asked her what sad thing had befallen her, that she was in that plight; 
and when she had told him what injury had been offered her, he comforted
 her, and desired her to be quiet, and take all patiently, and not to 
esteem her being corrupted by her brother as an injury. So she yielded 
to his advice, and left off her crying out, and discovering the force 
offered her to the multitude; and she continued as a widow with her 
brother Absalom a long time.</p>
<p>2. When David his father knew this, he was grieved at the actions of 
Amnon; but because he had an extraordinary affection for him, for he was
 his eldest son, he was compelled not to afflict him; but Absalom 
watched for a fit opportunity of revenging this crime upon him, for he 
thoroughly hated him. Now the second year after this wicked affair about
 his sister was over, and Absalom was about to go to shear his own sheep
 at Baalhazor, which is a city in the portion of Ephraim, he besought 
his father, as well as his brethren, to come and feast with him: but 
when David excused himself, as not being willing to be burdensome to 
him, Absalom desired he would however send his brethren; whom he did 
send accordingly. Then Absalom charged his own servants, that when they 
should see Amnon disordered and drowsy with wine, and he should give 
them a signal, they should fear nobody, but kill him.</p>
<p>3. When they had done as they were commanded, the rest of his 
brethren were astonished and disturbed, and were afraid for themselves, 
so they immediately got on horseback, and rode away to their father; but
 somebody there was who prevented them, and told their father they were 
all slain by Absalom; whereupon he was overcome with sorrow, as for so 
many of his sons that were destroyed at once, and that by their brother 
also; and by this consideration, that it was their brother that appeared
 to have slain them, he aggravated his sorrow for them. So he neither 
inquired what was the cause of this slaughter, nor staid to hear any 
thing else, which yet it was but reasonable to have done, when so very 
great, and by that greatness so incredible, a misfortune was related to 
him: he rent his clothes and threw himself upon the ground, and there 
lay lamenting the loss of all his sons, both those who, <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="192" data-page-number="192" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/206"></span></span>as
 he was informed, were slain, and of him who slew them. But Jonadab, the
 son of his brother Shemeah, entreated him not to indulge his sorrow so 
far, for as to the rest of his sons he did not believe that they were 
slain, for he found no cause for such a suspicion; but he said it might 
deserve inquiry as to Amnon, for it was not unlikely that Absalom might 
venture to kill him on account of the injury he had offered to Tamar. In
 the mean time, a great noise of horses, and a tumult of some people 
that were coming, turned their attention to them; they were the king's 
sons, who were fled away from the feast. So their father met them as 
they were in their grief, and he himself grieved with them; but it was 
more than he expected to see those his sons again, whom he had a little 
before heard to have perished. However, their were tears on both sides; 
they lamenting their brother who was killed, and the king lamenting his 
son, who was killed also; but Absalom fled to Geshur, to his grandfather
 by his mother's side, who was king of that country, and he remained 
with him three whole years.</p>
<p>4. Now David had a design to send to Absalom, not that he should come
 to be punished, but that he might be with him, for the effects of his 
anger were abated by length of time. It was Joab, the captain of his 
host, that chiefly persuaded him so to do; for he suborned an ordinary 
woman, that was stricken in age, to go to the king in mourning apparel, 
who said thus to him: - That two of her sons, in a coarse way, had some 
difference between them, and that in the progress of that difference 
they came to an open quarrel, and that one was smitten by the other, and
 was dead; and she desired him to interpose in this case, and to do her 
the favor to save this her son from her kindred, who were very zealous 
to have him that had slain his brother put to death, that so she might 
not be further deprived of the hopes she had of being taken care of in 
her old age by him; and that if he would hinder this slaughter of her 
son by those that wished for it, he would do her a great favor, because 
the kindred would not be restrained from their purpose by any thing else
 than by the fear of him. And when the king had given his consent to 
what the woman had begged of him, she made this reply to him: - "I owe 
thee thanks for thy benignity to me in pitying my old age, and 
preventing the loss of my only remaining child; but in order to assure 
me of this thy kindness, be first reconciled to thine own son, and cease
 to be angry with him; for how shall I persuade myself that thou hast 
really bestowed this favor upon me, while thou thyself continuest after 
the like manner in thy wrath to thine own son? for it is a foolish thing
 to add willfully another to thy dead son, while the death of the other 
was brought about without thy consent." And now the king perceived that 
this pretended story was a subornation derived from Joab, and was of his
 contrivance; and when, upon inquiry of the old woman, he understood it 
to be so in reality, he called for Joab, and told him he had obtained 
what he requested according to his own mind; and he bid him bring 
Absalom back, for he was not now displeased, but had already ceased to 
be angry with him. So Joab bowed himself down to the king, and took his 
words kindly, and went immediately to Geshur, and took Absalom with him,
 and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>5. However, the king sent a message to his son beforehand, as he was 
coming, and commanded him to retire to his own house, for he was not yet
 in such a disposition as to think fit at present to see him. 
Accordingly, upon the father's command, he avoided coming into his 
presence, and contented himself with the respects paid him by his own 
family only. Now his beauty was not impaired, either by the grief he had
 been under, or by the want of such care as was proper to be taken of a 
king's son, for he still surpassed and excelled all men in the tallness 
of his body, and was more eminent [in a fine appearance] than those that
 dieted the most luxuriously; and indeed such was the thickness of the 
hair of his head, that it was with difficulty that he was polled every 
eighth day; and his hair weighed two hundred shekels (15) which are five
 pounds. However, he dwelt in Jerusalem two years, and became the father
 of three sons, and one daughter; which daughter was of very great 
beauty, and which Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, took to wife afterward, 
and had by her a son named Abijah. But Absalom sent to Joab, and desired
 him to pacify his father entirely towards him; and to beseech him to 
give him leave to come to him to see him, and speak with him. But when 
Joab neglected so to do, he sent some of his own servants, and set fire 
to the field adjoining to him; which, when Joab understood, he came to 
Absalom, and accused him of what he had done; and asked him the reason 
why he did so. To which Absalom replied, that "I have found out this 
stratagem that might bring thee to us, while thou hast taken no care to 
perform the injunction I laid upon thee, which was this, to reconcile my
 father to me; and I really beg it of thee, now thou art here, to pacify
 my father as to me, since I esteem my coming hither to be more grievous
 than my banishment, while <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="193" data-page-number="193" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/207"></span></span>my
 father's wrath against me continues." Hereby Joab was persuaded, and 
pitied the distress that Absalom was in, and became an intercessor with 
the king for him. And when he had discoursed with his father, he soon 
brought him to that amicable disposition towards Absalom, that he 
presently sent for him to come to him; and when he had cast himself down
 upon the ground, and had begged for the forgiveness of his offenses, 
the king raised him up, and promised him to forget what he had formerly 
done.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 9.</p>
<p>Concerning The Insurrection Of Absalom Against David And Concerning 
Ahithophel And Hushai; And Concerning Ziba And Shimei; And How 
Ahithophel Hanged Himself.</p>
<p>1. Now Absalom, upon this his success with the king, procured to 
himself a great many horses, and many chariots, and that in a little 
time also. He had moreover fifty armor-bearers that were about him; and 
he came early every day to the king's palace, and spake what was 
agreeable to such as came for justice and lost their causes, as if that 
happened for want of good counselors about the king, or perhaps because 
the judges mistook in that unjust sentence they gave; whereby he gained 
the good-will of them all. He told them, that had he but such authority 
committed to him, he would distribute justice to them in a most 
equitable manner. When he had made himself so popular among the 
multitude, he thought he had already the good-will of the people secured
 to him; but when four years (16) had passed since his father's 
reconciliation to him, he came to him, and besought him to give him 
leave to go to Hebron, and pay a sacrifice to God, because he vowed it 
to him when he fled out of the country. So when David had granted his 
request, he went thither, and great multitudes came running together to 
him, for he had sent to a great number so to do.</p>
<p>2. Among them came Ahithophel the Gilonite, a counsellor of David's, 
and two hundred men out of Jerusalem itself, who knew not his 
intentions, but were sent for as to a sacrifice. So he was appointed 
king by all of them, which he obtained by this stratagem. As soon as 
this news was brought to David, and he was informed of what he did not 
expect from his son, he was aftrighted at this his impious and bold 
undertaking, and wondered that he was so far from remembering how his 
offense had been so lately forgiven him, that he undertook much worse 
and more wicked enterprises; first, to deprive him of that kingdom which
 was given him of God; and secondly, to take away his own father's life.
 He therefore resolved to fly to the parts beyond Jordan: so he called 
his most intimate friends together, and communicated to them all that he
 had heard of his son's madness. He committed himself to God, to judge 
between them about all their actions; and left the care of his royal 
palace to his ten concubines, and went away from Jerusalem, being 
willingly accompanied by the rest of the multitude, who went hastily 
away with him, and particularly by those six hundred armed men, who had 
been with him from his first flight in the days of Saul. But he 
persuaded Abiathar and Zadok, the high priests, who had determined to go
 away with him, as also all the Levites, who were with the ark, to stay 
behind, as hoping that God would deliver him without its removal; but he
 charged them to let him know privately how all things went on; and he 
had their sons, Ahimmaz the son of Zadok, and Jonathan the son of 
Abiathar, for faithful ministers in all things; but Ittai the Gitrite 
went out with him whether David would let him or not, for he would have 
persuaded him to stay, and on that account he appeared the more friendly
 to him. But as he was ascending the Mount of Olives barefooted, and all
 his company were in tears, it was told him that Ahithophel was with 
Absalom, and was of his side. This hearing augmented his grief; and he 
besought God earnestly to alienate the mind of Absalom from Ahithophel, 
for he was afraid that he should persuade him to follow his pernicious 
counsel, for he was a prudent man, and very sharp in seeing what was 
advantageous. When David was gotten upon the top of the mountain, he 
took a view of the city; and prayed to God with abundance of tears, as 
having already lost his kingdom; and here it was that a faithful friend 
of his, whose name was Hushai, met him. When David saw him with his 
clothes rent, and having ashes all over his head, and in lamentation for
 the great change of affairs, he comforted him, and exhorted him to 
leave off grieving; nay, at length he besought him to go back to 
Absalom, and appear as one of his party, and to fish out the secretest 
counsels of his mind, and to contradict the counsels of Ahithophel, for 
that he could not do him so much good by being with him as he might by 
being with Absalom. So he was prevailed on by David, and left him, and 
came to Jerusalem, whither Absalom himself came also a little while 
afterward.</p>
<p>3. When David was gone a little farther, there met him Ziba, the 
servant of Mephibosheth, (whom he had sent to take care of the 
possessions which had been given him, as the son of Jonathan, the son of
 Saul,) with a couple of asses, loaden with provisions, and desired him <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="194" data-page-number="194" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/208"></span></span>to
 take as much of them as he and his followers stood in need of. And when
 the king asked him where he had left Mephibosheth, he said he had left 
him in Jerusalem, expecting to be chosen king in the present confusions,
 in remembrance of the benefits Saul had conferred upon them. At this 
the king had great indignation, and gave to Ziba all that he had 
formerly bestowed on Mephibosheth; for he determined that it was much 
fitter that he should have them than the other; at which Ziba greatly 
rejoiced.</p>
<p>4. When David was at Bahurim, a place so called, there came out a 
kinsman of Saul's, whose name was Shimei, and threw stones at him, and 
gave him reproachful words; and as his friends stood about the king and 
protected him, he persevered still more in his reproaches, and called 
him a bloody man, and the author of all sorts of mischief. He bade him 
also go out of the land as an impure and accursed wretch; and he thanked
 God for depriving him of his kingdom, and causing him to be punished 
for what injuries he had done to his master [Saul], and this by the 
means of his own son. Now when they were all provoked against him, and 
angry at bin;, and particularly Abishai, who had a mind to kill Shimei, 
David restrained his anger. "Let us not," said he, "bring upon ourselves
 another fresh misfortune to those we have already, for truly I have not
 the least regard nor concern for this dog that raves at me: I submit 
myself to God, by whose permission this man treats me in such a wild 
manner; nor is it any wonder that I am obliged to undergo these abuses 
from him, while I experience the like from an impious son of my own; but
 perhaps God will have some commiseration upon us; if it be his will we 
shall overcome them." So he went on his way without troubling himself 
with Shimei, who ran along the other side of the mountain, and threw out
 his abusive language plentifully. But when David was come to Jordan, he
 allowed those that were with him to refresh themselves; for they were 
weary.</p>
<p>5. But when Absalom, and Ahithophel his counselor, were come to 
Jerusalem, with all the people, David's friend, Hushai, came to them; 
and when he had worshipped Absalom, he withal wished that his kingdom 
might last a long time, and continue for all ages. But when Absalom said
 to him, "How comes this, that he who was so intimate a friend of my 
father's, and appeared faithful to him in all things, is not with him 
now, but hath left him, and is come over to me?" Hushai's answer was 
very pertinent and prudent; for he said, "We ought to follow God and the
 multitude of the people; while these, therefore, my lord and master, 
are with thee, it is fit that I should follow them, for thou hast 
received the kingdom from God. I will therefore, if thou believest me to
 be thy friend, show the same fidelity and kindness to thee, which thou 
knowest I have shown to thy father; nor is there any reason to be in the
 least dissatisfied with the present state of affairs, for the kingdom 
is not transferred into another, but remains still in the same family, 
by the son's receiving it after his father." This speech persuaded 
Absalom, who before suspected Hushai. And now he called Ahithophel, and 
consulted with him what he ought to do: he persuaded him to go in unto 
his father's concubines; for he said that "by this action the people 
would believe that thy difference with thy father is irreconcilable, and
 will thence fight with great alacrity against thy father, for hitherto 
they are afraid of taking up open enmity against him, out of an 
expectation that you will be reconciled again." Accordingly, Absalom was
 prevailed on by this advice, and commanded his servants to pitch him a 
tent upon the top of the royal palace, in the sight of the multitude; 
and he went in and lay with his father's concubines. Now this came to 
pass according to the prediction of Nathan, when he prophesied and 
signified to him that his son would rise up in rebellion against him.</p>
<p>6. And when Absalom had done what he was advised to by Ahithophel, he
 desired his advice, in the second place, about the war against his 
father. Now Ahithophel only asked him to let him have ten thousand 
chosen men, and he promised he would slay his father, and bring the 
soldiers back again in safety; and he said that then the kingdom would 
be firm to him when David was dead [but not otherwise]. Absalom was 
pleased with this advice, and called for Hushai, David's friend (for so 
did he style him); and informing him of the opinion of Ahithophel, he 
asked, further, what was his opinion concerning that matter. Now he was 
sensible that if Ahithophel's counsel were followed, David would be in 
danger of being seized on, and slain; so he attempted to introduce a 
contrary opinion, and said, Thou art not unacquainted, O king, with the 
valor of thy father, and of those that are now with him; that he hath 
made many wars, and hath always come off with victory, though probably 
he now abides in the camp, for he is very skiliful in stratagems, and in
 foreseeing the deceitful tricks of his enemies; yet will he leave his 
own soldiers in the evening, and will either hide himself in some 
valley, or will place an ambush at some rock; so that when our army 
joins battle with him, his soldiers will retire for a little while, but 
will come upon us again, as encouraged by the king's being near them; 
and in the mean time your father will show himself suddenly in the time 
of the battle, and will infuse courage into his own people when they are
 in danger, but bring consternation to thine. Consider, therefore, my 
advice, and reason upon it, and if thou canst not but acknowledge it to 
be the best, reject the opinion of Ahithophel. Send to the entire 
country of the Hebrews, and order them to come and fight with thy 
father; and do thou thyself take the army, and be thine own general in 
this war, and do not trust its management to another; then expect to 
conquer him with ease, when thou overtakest him openly wi <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="195" data-page-number="195" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/209"></span></span>th
 his few partisans, but hast thyself many ten thousands, who will be 
desirous to demonstrate to thee their diligence and alacrity. And if thy
 father shall shut himself up in some city, and bear a siege, we will 
overthrow that city with machines of war, and by undermining it." When 
Hushai had said this, he obtained his point against Ahithophel, for his 
opinion was preferred by Absalom before the other's: however, it was no 
other than God (17) who made the counsel of Hushai appear best to the 
mind of Absalom.</p>
<p>7. So Hushai made haste to the high priests, Zadok and Abiathar, and 
told them the opinion of Ahithophel, and his own, and that the 
resolution was taken to follow this latter advice. He therefore bade 
them send to David, and tell him of it, and to inform him of the 
counsels that had been taken; and to desire him further to pass quickly 
over Jordan, lest his son should change his mind, and make haste to 
pursue him, and so prevent him, and seize upon him before he be in 
safety. Now the high priests had their sons concealed in a proper place 
out of the city, that they might carry news to David of what was 
transacted. Accordingly, they sent a maid-servant, whom they could 
trust, to them, to carry the news of Absalom's counsels, and ordered 
them to signify the same to David with all speed. So they made no excuse
 nor delay, but taking along with them their fathers' injunctions, 
because pious and faithful ministers, and judging that quickness and 
suddenness was the best mark of faithful service, they made haste to 
meet with David. But certain horsemen saw them when they were two 
furlongs from the city, and informed Absalom of them, who immediately 
sent some to take them; but when the sons of the high priest perceived 
this, they went out of the road, and betook themselves to a certain 
village; that village was called Bahurim; there they desired a certain 
woman to hide them, and afford them security. Accordingly she let the 
young men down by a rope into a well, and laid fleeces of wool over 
them; and when those that pursued them came to her, and asked her 
whether she saw them, she did not deny that she had seen them, for that 
they staid with her some time, but she said they then went their ways; 
and she foretold that, however, if they would follow them directly, they
 would catch them; but when after a long pursuit they could not catch 
them, they came back again; and when the woman saw those men were 
returned, and that there was no longer any fear of the young men's being
 caught by them, she drew them up by the rope, and bade them go on their
 journey accordingly, they used great diligence in the prosecution of 
that journey, and came to David, and informed him accurately of all the 
counsels of Absalom. So he commanded those that were with him to pass 
over Jordan while it was night, and not to delay at all on that account.</p>
<p>8. But Ahithophel, on rejection of his advice, got upon his ass, and 
rode away to his own country, Gilon; and, calling his family together, 
he told them distinctly what advice he had given Absalom; and since he 
had not been persuaded by it, he said he would evidently perish, and 
this in no long time, and that David would overcome him, and return to 
his kingdom again; so he said it was better that he should take his own 
life away with freedom and magnanimity, than expose himself to be 
punished by David, in opposition to whom he had acted entirely for 
Absalom. When he had discoursed thus to them, he went into the inmost 
room of his house, and hanged himself; and thus was the death of 
Ahithophel, who was self-condemned; and when his relations had taken him
 down from the halter, they took care of his funeral. Now, as for David,
 he passed over Jordan, as we have said already, and came to Mahanaim, 
every fine and very strong city; and all the chief men of the country 
received him with great pleasure, both out of the shame they had that he
 should be forced to flee away [from Jerusalem], and out of the respect 
they bare him while he was in his former prosperity. These were 
Barzillai the Gileadite, and Siphar the ruler among the Ammonites, and 
Machir the principal man of Gilead; and these furnished him with 
plentiful provisions for himself and his followers, insomuch that they 
wanted no beds nor blankets for them, nor loaves of bread, nor wine; 
nay, they brought them a great many cattle for slaughter, and afforded 
them what furniture they wanted for their refreshment when they were 
weary, and for food, with plenty of other necessaries. <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="196" data-page-number="196" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/210"></span></span></p>
<p>CHAPTER 10.</p>
<p>How, When Absalom Was Beaten, He Was Caught In A Tree By His Hair And Was Slain</p>
<p>1. And this was the state of David and his followers: but Absalom got
 together a vast army of the Hebrews to oppose his father, and passed 
therewith over the river Jordan, and sat down not far off Mahanaim, in 
the country of Gilead. He appointed Amasa to be captain of all his host,
 instead of Joab his kinsman: his father was Ithra and his mother 
Abigail: now she and Zeruiah, the mother of Joab, were David's sisters. 
But when David had numbered his followers, and found them to be about 
four thousand, he resolved not to tarry till Absalom attacked him, but 
set over his men captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and 
divided his army into three parts; the one part he committed to Joab, 
the next to Abishai, Joab's brother, and the third to Ittai, David's 
companion and friend, but one that came from the city Gath; and when he 
was desirous of fighting himself among them, his friends would not let 
him: and this refusal of theirs was founded upon very wise reasons: 
"For," said they, "if we be conquered when he is with us, we have lost 
all good hopes of recovering ourselves; but if we should be beaten in 
one part of our army, the other parts may retire to him, and may thereby
 prepare a greater force, while the enemy will naturally suppose that he
 hath another army with him." So David was pleased with this their 
advice, and resolved himself to tarry at Mahanaim; and as he sent his 
friends and commanders to the battle, he desired them to show all 
possible alacrity and fidelity, and to bear in mind what advantages they
 had received from him, which, though they had not been very great, yet 
had they not been quite inconsiderable; and he begged of them to spare 
the young man Absalom, lest some mischief should befall himself, if he 
should be killed; and thus did he send out his army to the battle, and 
wished them victory therein.</p>
<p>2. Then did Joab put his army in battle-array over against the enemy 
in the Great Plain, where he had a wood behind him. Absalom also brought
 his army into the field to oppose him. Upon the joining of the battle, 
both sides showed great actions with their hands and their boldness; the
 one side exposing themselves to the greatest hazards, and using their 
utmost alacrity, that David might recover his kingdom; and the other 
being no way deficient, either in doing or suffering, that Absalom might
 not be deprived of that kingdom, and be brought to punishment by his 
father for his impudent attempt against him. Those also that were the 
most numerous were solicitous that they might not be conquered by those 
few that were with Joab, and with the other commanders, because that 
would be the greater disgrace to them; while David's soldiers strove 
greatly to overcome so many ten thousands as the enemy had with them. 
Now David's men were conquerors, as superior in strength and skill in 
war; so they followed the others as they fled away through the forests 
and valleys; some they took prisoners, and many they slew, and more in 
the flight than in the battle for there fell about twenty thousand that 
day. But all David's men ran violently upon Absalom, for he was easily 
known by his beauty and tallness. He was himself also afraid lest his 
enemies should seize on him, so he got upon the king's mule, and fled; 
but as he was carried with violence, and noise, and a great motion, as 
being himself light, he entangled his hair greatly in the large boughs 
of a knotty tree that spread a great way, and there he hung, after a 
surprising manner; and as for the beast, it went on farther, and that 
swiftly, as if his master had been still upon his back; but he, hanging 
in the air upon the boughs, was taken by his enemies. Now when one of 
David's soldiers saw this, he informed Joab of it; and when the general 
said, that if he had shot at and killed Absalom, he would have given him
 fifty shekels, - he replied, "I would not have killed my master's son 
if thou wouldst have given me a thousand shekels, especially when he 
desired that the young man might be spared in the hearing of us all." 
But Joab bade him show him where it was that he saw Absalom hang; 
whereupon he shot him to the heart, and slew him, and Joab's 
armor-bearers stood round the tree, and pulled down his dead body, and 
cast it into a great chasm that was out of sight, and laid a heap of 
stones upon him, till the cavity was filled up, and had both the 
appearance and the bigness of a grave. Then Joab sounded a retreat, and 
recalled his own soldiers from pursuing the enemy's army, in order to 
spare their countrymen.</p>
<p>3. Now Absalom had erected for himself a marble pillar in the king's 
dale, two furlongs distant from Jerusalem, which he named Absalom's 
Hand, saying, that if his children were killed, his name would remain by
 that pillar; for he had three sons and one daughter, named Tamar, as we
 said before, who when she was married to David's grandson, Rehoboam, 
bare a son, Abijah by name, who succeeded his father in the kingdom; but
 of these we shall speak in a part of our history which will be more 
proper. After the death of Absalom, they returned every one to their own
 homes respectively.</p>
<p>4. But now Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok the high priest, went to Joab, 
and desired he would permit him to go and tell David of this victory, 
and to bring him the good news that God had afforded his assistance and 
his providence to him. However, he did not grant his request, but said 
to him, "Wilt thou, who hast always been the messenger of good news, now
 go and acquaint the king that his son is dead?" So he desired him t <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="197" data-page-number="197" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/211"></span></span>o
 desist. He then called Cushi, and committed the business to him, that 
he should tell the king what he had seen. But when Ahimaaz again desired
 him to let him go as a messenger, and assured him that he would only 
relate what concerned the victory, but not concerning the death of 
Absalom, he gave him leave to go to David. Now he took a nearer road 
than the former did, for nobody knew it but himself, and he came before 
Cushi. Now as David was sitting between the gates, (18) and waiting to 
see when somebody would come to him from the battle, and tell him how it
 went, one of the watchmen saw Ahimaaz running, and before he could 
discern who he was, he told David that he saw somebody coming to him, 
who said he was a good messenger. A little while after, he informed him 
that another messenger followed him; whereupon the king said that he 
also was a good messenger: but when the watchman saw Ahimaaz, and that 
he was already very near, he gave the king notice that it was the son of
 Zadok the high priest who came running. So David was very glad, and 
said he was a messenger of good tidings, and brought him some such news 
from the battle as he desired to hear.</p>
<p>5. While the king was saying thus, Ahimaaz appeared, and worshipped 
the king. And when the king inquired of him about the battle, he said he
 brought him the good news of victory and dominion. And when he inquired
 what he had to say concerning his son, he said that he came away on the
 sudden as soon as the enemy was defeated, but that he heard a great 
noise of those that pursued Absalom, and that he could learn no more, 
because of the haste he made when Joab sent him to inform him of the 
victory. But when Cushi was come, and had worshipped him, and informed 
him of the victory, he asked him about his son, who replied, "May the 
like misfortune befall thine enemies as hath befallen Absalom." That 
word did not permit either himself or his soldiers to rejoice for the 
victory, though it was a very great one; but David went up to the 
highest part of the city, (19) and wept for his son, and beat his 
breast, tearing [the hair of] his head, tormenting himself all manner of
 ways, and crying out, "O my son! I wish that I had died myself, and 
ended my days with thee!" for he was of a tender natural affection, and 
had extraordinary compassion for this son in particular. But when the 
army and Joab heard that the king mourned for his son, they were ashamed
 to enter the city in the habit of conquerors, but they all came in as 
cast down, and in tears, as if they had been beaten. Now while the king 
covered himself, and grievously lamented his son, Joab went in to him, 
and comforted him, and said, "O my lord the king, thou art not aware 
that thou layest a blot on thyself by what thou now doest; for thou 
seemest to hate those that love thee, and undergo dangers for thee nay, 
to hate thyself and thy family, and to love those that are thy bitter 
enemies, and to desire the company of those that are no more, and who 
have been justly slain; for had Absalom gotten the victory, and firmly 
settled himself in the kingdom, there had been none of us left alive, 
but all of us, beginning with thyself and thy children, had miserably 
perished, while our enemies had not wept for his, but rejoiced over us, 
and punished even those that pitied us in our misfortunes; and thou art 
not ashamed to do this in the case of one that has been thy bitter 
enemy, who, while he was thine own son hath proved so wicked to thee. 
Leave off, therefore, thy unreasonable grief, and come abroad and be 
seen of thy soldiers, and return them thanks for the alacrity they 
showed in the fight; for I myself will this day persuade the people to 
leave thee, and to give the kingdom to another, if thou continuest to do
 thus; and then I shall make thee to grieve bitterly and in earnest." 
Upon Joab's speaking thus to him, he made the king leave off his sorrow,
 and brought him to the consideration of his affairs. So David changed 
his habit, and exposed himself in a manner fit to be seen by the 
multitude, and sat at the gates; whereupon all the people heard of it, 
and ran together to him, and saluted him. And this was the present state
 of David's affairs.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 11.</p>
<p>How David, When He Had Recovered His Kingdom, Was Reconciled To 
Shimei, And To Ziba; And Showed A Great Affection To Barzillai; And How,
 Upon The Rise Of A Sedition, He Made Amasa Captain Of His Host, In 
Order To Pursue Seba; Which Amasa Was Slain By Joab.</p>
<p>1. Now those Hebrews that had been With <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="198" data-page-number="198" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/212"></span></span>Absalom,
 and had retired out of the battle, when they were all returned home, 
sent messengers to every city to put them in mind of what benefits David
 had bestowed upon them, and of that liberty which he had procured them,
 by delivering them from many and great wars. But they complained, that 
whereas they had ejected him out of his kingdom, and committed it to 
another governor, which other governor, whom they had set up, was 
already dead, they did not now beseech David to leave off his anger at 
them, and to become friends with them, and, as he used to do, to resume 
the care of their affairs, and take the kingdom again. This was often 
told to David. And, this notwithstanding, David sent to Zadok and 
Abiathar the high priests, that they should speak to the rulers of the 
tribe of Judah after the manner following: That it would be a reproach 
upon them to permit the other tribes to choose David for their king 
before their tribe, "and this," said he, "while you are akin to him, and
 of the same common blood." He commanded them also to say the same to 
Amasa the captain of their forces, That whereas he was his sister's son,
 he had not persuaded the multitude to restore the kingdom to David; 
that he might expect from him not only a reconciliation, for that was 
already granted, but that supreme command of the army also which Absalom
 had bestowed upon him. Accordingly the high priests, when they had 
discoursed with the rulers of the tribe, and said what the king had 
ordered them, persuaded Amasa to undertake the care of his affairs. So 
he persuaded that tribe to send immediately ambassadors to him, to 
beseech him to return to his own kingdom. The same did all the 
Israelites, at the like persuasion of Amasa.</p>
<p>2. When the ambassadors came to him, he came to Jerusalem; and the 
tribe of Judah was the first that came to meet the king at the river 
Jordan. And Shimei, the son of Gera, came with a thousand men, which he 
brought with him out of the tribe of Benjamin; and Ziba, the freed-man 
of Saul, with his sons, fifteen in number, and with his twenty servants.
 All these, as well as the tribe of Judah, laid a bridge [of boats] over
 the river, that the king, and those that were with him, might with ease
 pass over it. Now as soon as he was come to Jordan, the tribe of Judah 
saluted him. Shimei also came upon the bridge, and took hold of his 
feet, and prayed him to forgive him what he had offended, and not to be 
too bitter against him, nor to think fit to make him the first example 
of severity under his new authority; but to consider that he had 
repented of his failure of duty, and had taken care to come first of all
 to him. While he was thus entreating the king, and moving him to 
compassion, Abishai, Joab's brother, said, "And shall not this man die 
for this, that he hath cursed that king whom God hath appointed to reign
 over us?" But David turned himself to him, and said, "Will you never 
leave off, ye sons of Zeruiah? Do not you, I pray, raise new troubles 
and seditions among us, now the former are over; for I would not have 
you ignorant that I this day begin my reign, and therefore swear to 
remit to all offenders their punishments, and not to animadvert on any 
one that has sinned. Be thou, therefore," said he, "O Shimei, of good 
courage, and do not at all fear being put to death." So he worshipped 
him, and went on before him.</p>
<p>3. Mephibosheth also, Saul's grandson, met David, clothed in a sordid
 garment, and having his hair thick and neglected; for after David was 
fled away, he was in such grief that he had not polled his head, nor had
 he washed his clothes, as dooming himself to undergo such hardships 
upon occasion of the change-of the king's affairs. Now he had been 
unjustly calumniated to the king by Ziba, his steward. When he had 
saluted the king, and worshipped him, the king began to ask him why he 
did not go out of Jerusalem with him, and accompany him during his 
flight. He replied, that this piece of injustice was owing to Ziba; 
because, when he was ordered to get things ready for his going out with 
him, he took no care of it, but regarded him no more than if he had been
 a slave; "and, indeed, had I had my feet sound and strong, I had not 
deserted thee, for I could then have made use of them in my flight: but 
this is not all the injury that Ziba has done me, as to my duty to thee,
 my lord and master, but he hath calumniated me besides, and told lies 
about me of his own invention; but I know thy mind will not admit of 
such calumnies, but is righteously disposed, and a lover of truth, which
 it is also the will of God should prevail. For when thou wast in the 
greatest danger of suffering by my grandfather, and when, on that 
account, our whole family might justly have been destroyed, thou wast 
moderate and merciful, and didst then especially forget all those 
injuries, when, if thou hadst remembered them, thou hadst the power of 
punishing us for them; but thou hast judged me to be thy friend, and 
hast set me every day at thine own table; nor have I wanted any thing 
which one of thine own kinsmen, of greatest esteem with thee, could have
 expected." When he had said this, David resolved neither to punish 
Mephibosheth, nor to condemn Ziba, as having belied his master; <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="199" data-page-number="199" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/213"></span></span>but
 said to him, that as he had [before] granted all his estate to Ziba, 
because he did not come along with him, so he [now] promised to forgive 
him, and ordered that the one half of his estate should be restored to 
him. (20) Whereupon Mephibosheth said, "Nay, let Ziba take all; it 
suffices me that thou hast recovered thy kingdom."</p>
<p>4. But David desired Barzillai the Gileadite, that great and good 
man, and one that had made a plentiful provision for him at Mahanaim, 
and had conducted him as far as Jordan, to accompany him to Jerusalem, 
for he promised to treat him in his old age with all manner of respect -
 to take care of him, and provide for him. But Barzillai was so desirous
 to live at home, that he entreated him to excuse him from attendance on
 him; and said that his age was too great to enjoy the pleasures [of a 
court,] since he was fourscore years old, and was therefore making 
provision for his death and burial: so he desired him to gratify him in 
this request, and dismiss him; for he had no relish of his meat, or his 
drink, by reason of his age; and that his ears were too much shut up to 
hear the sound of pipes, or the melody of other musical instruments, 
such as all those that live with kings delight in. When he entreated for
 this so earnestly, the king said, "I dismiss thee, but thou shalt grant
 me thy son Chimham, and upon him I will bestow all sorts of good 
things." So Barzillai left his son with him, and worshipped the king, 
and wished him a prosperous conclusion of all his affairs according to 
his own mind, and then returned home; but David came to Gilgal, having 
about him half the people [of Israel], and the [whole] tribe of Judah.</p>
<p>5. Now the principal men of the country came to Gilgal to him with a 
great multitude, and complained of the tribe of Judah, that they had 
come to him in a private manner; whereas they ought all conjointly, and 
with one and the same intention, to have given him the meeting. But the 
rulers of the tribe of Judah desired them not to be displeased, if they 
had been prevented by them; for, said they, "We are David's kinsmen, and
 on that account we the rather took care of him, and loved him, and so 
came first to him;" yet had they not, by their early coming, received 
any gifts from him, which might give them who came last any uneasiness. 
When the rulers of the tribe of Judah had said this, the rulers of the 
other tribes were not quiet, but said further, "O brethren, we cannot 
but wonder at you when you call the king your kinsman alone, whereas he 
that hath received from God the power over all of us in common ought to 
be esteemed a kinsman to us all; for which reason the whole people have 
eleven parts in him, and you but one part (21) we are also elder than 
you; wherefore you have not done justly in coming to the king in this 
private and concealed manner."</p>
<p>6. While these rulers were thus disputing one with another, a certain
 wicked man, who took a pleasure in seditious practices, (his name was 
Sheba, the son of Bichri, of the tribe of Benjamin,) stood up in the 
midst of the multitude, and cried aloud, and spake thus to them: "We 
have no part in David, nor inheritance in the son of Jesse." And when he
 had used those words, he blew with a trumpet, and declared war against 
the king; and they all left David, and followed him; the tribe of Judah 
alone staid with him, and settled him in his royal palace at Jerusalem. 
But as for his concubines, with whom Absalom his son had accompanied, 
truly he removed them to another house, and ordered those that had the 
care of them to make a plentiful provision for them, but he came not 
near them any more. He also appointed Amass for the captain of his 
forces, and gave him the same high office which Joab before had; and he 
commanded him to gather together, out of the tribe of Judah, as great an
 army as he could, and come to him within three days, that he might 
deliver to him his entire army, and might send him to fight against 
[Sheba] the son of Bichri. Now while Amass was gone out, and made some 
delay in gathering the army together, and so was not yet returned, on 
the third day the king said to Joab, "It is not fit we should make any 
delay in this affair of Sheba, lest he get a numerous army about him, 
and be the occasion of greater mischief, and hurt our affairs more than 
did Absalom himself; do not thou therefore wait any longer, but take 
such forces as thou hast at hand, and that [old] body of six hundred 
men, and thy brother Abishai, with thee, and pursue after our enemy, and
 endeavor to fight him wheresoever thou canst overtake him. Make haste 
to prevent him, lest he seize upon some fenced cities, and cause us 
great labor and pains before we take him."</p>
<p>7. So Joab resolved to make no delay, but taking with him his 
brother, and those six hundred men, and giving orders that the rest of 
the army which was at Jerusalem should follow him, he marched with great
 speed against Sheba; and when he was come to Gibeon, which is a village
 forty furlongs distant from Jerusalem, Amasa brought a great army with 
him, and met Joab. Now Joab was girded with a sword, and his breastplate
 on; and when Amasa came near him to salute him, he took particular care
 that his sword should fall out, as it were, of its own accord: so he 
took <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="200" data-page-number="200" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/214"></span></span>it
 up from the ground, and while he approached Amasa, who was then near 
him, as though he would kiss him, he took hold of Amasa's beard with his
 other hand, and he smote him in his belly when he did not foresee it, 
and slew him. This impious and altogether profane action Joab did to a 
good young man, and his kinsman, and one that had done him no injury, 
and this out of jealousy that he would obtain the chief command of the 
army, and be in equal dignity with himself about the king; and for the 
same cause it was that he killed Abner. But as to that former wicked 
action, the death of his brother Asahel, which he seemed to revenge, 
afforded him a decent pretense, and made that crime a pardonable one; 
but in this murder of Amasa there was no such covering for it. Now when 
Joab had killed this general, he pursued after Sheba, having left a man 
with the dead body, who was ordered to proclaim aloud to the army, that 
Amasa was justly slain, and deservedly punished. "But," said he, "if you
 be for the king, follow Joab his general, and Abishai, Joab's brother:"
 but because the body lay on the road, and all the multitude came 
running to it, and, as is usual with the multitude, stood wondering a 
great while at it, he that guarded it removed it thence, and carried it 
to a certain place that was very remote from the road, and there laid 
it, and covered it with his garment. When this was done, all the people 
followed Joab. Now as he pursued Sheba through all the country of 
Israel, one told him that he was in a strong city, called 
Abelbeth-maachah. Hereupon Joab went thither, and set about it with his 
army, and cast up a bank round it, and ordered his soldiers to undermine
 the walls, and to overthrow them; and since the people in the city did 
not admit him, he was greatly displeased at them.</p>
<p>8. Now there was a woman of small account, and yet both wise and 
intelligent, who seeing her native city lying at the last extremity, 
ascended upon the wall, and, by means of the armed men, called for Joab;
 and when he came to her, she began to say, That "God ordained kings and
 generals of armies, that they might cut off the enemies of the Hebrews,
 and introduce a universal peace among them; but thou art endeavoring to
 overthrow and depopulate a metropolis of the Israelites, which hath 
been guilty of no offense." But he replied, "God continue to be merciful
 unto me: I am disposed to avoid killing any one of the people, much 
less would I destroy such a city as this; and if they will deliver me up
 Sheba, the son of Bichri, who hath rebelled against the king, I will 
leave off the siege, and withdraw the army from the place." Now as soon 
as the woman heard what Joab said, she desired him to intermit the siege
 for a little while, for that he should have the head of his enemy 
thrown out to him presently. So she went down to the citizens, and said 
to them, "Will you be so wicked as to perish miserably, with your 
children and wives, for the sake of a vile fellow, and one whom nobody 
knows who he is? And will you have him for your king instead of David, 
who hath been so great a benefactor to you, and oppose your city alone 
to such a mighty and strong army?" So she prevailed with them, and they 
cut off the head of Sheba, and threw it into Joab's army. When this was 
done, the king's general sounded a retreat, and raised the siege. And 
when he was come to Jerusalem, he was again appointed to be general of 
all the people. The king also constituted Benaiah captain of the guards,
 and of the six hundred men. He also set Adoram over the tribute, and 
Sabathes and Achilaus over the records. He made Sheva the scribe, and 
appointed Zadok and Abiathar the high priests.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 12.</p>
<p>How The Hebrews Were Delivered From A Famine When The Gibeonites Had 
Caused Punishment To Be Inflicted For Those Of Them That Had Been Slain:
 As Also, What Great Actions Were Performed Against The Philistines By 
David, And The Men Of Valor About Him.</p>
<p>1. After this, when the country was greatly afflicted with a famine, 
David besought God to have mercy on the people, and to discover to him 
what was the cause of it, and how a remedy might be found for that 
distemper. And when the prophets answered, that God would have the 
Gibeonites avenged whom Saul the king was so wicked as to betray to 
slaughter, and had not observed the oath which Joshua the general and 
the senate had sworn to them: If, therefore, said God, the king would 
permit such vengeance to be taken for those that were slain as the 
Gibeonites should desire, he promised that he would be reconciled to 
them, and free the multitude from their miseries. As soon therefore as 
the king understood that this it was which God sought, he sent for the 
Gibeonites, and asked them what it was they should have; and when they 
desired to have seven sons of Saul delivered to them to be punished, he 
delivered them up, but spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan. So when 
the Gibeonites had received the men, they punished them as they pleased;
 upon which God began to send rain, and to recover the earth to bring 
forth its fruits as usual, and to free it from the foregoing drought, so
 that the country of the Hebrews flourished again. A little afterward 
the king made war against the Philistines; and when he had joined battle
 with them, and put them to flight, he was left alone, as he was in 
pursuit of them; and when he was quite tired down, he was seen by one of
 the enemy, his name was Achmon, the son of Araph, he was one of the 
sons of the giants. He had a spear, the handle of which weighed three 
hundred shekels, and a breastplate of <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="201" data-page-number="201" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/215"></span></span>chain-work,
 and a sword. He turned back, and ran violently to slay [David] their 
enemy's king, for he was quite tired out with labor; but Abishai, Joab's
 brother, appeared on the sudden, and protected the king with his 
shield, as he lay down, and slew the enemy. Now the multitude were very 
uneasy at these dangers of the king, and that he was very near to be 
slain; and the rulers made him swear that he would no more go out with 
them to battle, lest he should come to some great misfortune by his 
courage and boldness, and thereby deprive the people of the benefits 
they now enjoyed by his means, and of those that they might hereafter 
enjoy by his living a long time among them.</p>
<p>2. When the king heard that the Philistines were gathered together at
 the city Gazara, he sent an army against them, when Sibbechai the 
Hittite, one of David's most courageous men, behaved himself so as to 
deserve great commendation, for he slew many of those that bragged they 
were the posterity of the giants, and vaunted themselves highly on that 
account, and thereby was the occasion of victory to the Hebrews. After 
which defeat, the Philistines made war again; and when David had sent an
 army against them, Nephan his kinsman fought in a single combat with 
the stoutest of all the Philistines, and slew him, and put the rest to 
flight. Many of them also were slain in the fight. Now a little while 
after this, the Philistines pitched their camp at a city which lay not 
far off the bounds of the country of the Hebrews. They had a man who was
 six cubits tall, and had on each of his feet and hands one more toe and
 finger than men naturally have. Now the person who was sent against 
them by David out of his army was Jonathan, the son of Shimea, who 
fought this man in a single combat, and slew him; and as he was the 
person who gave the turn to the battle, he gained the greatest 
reputation for courage therein. This man also vaunted himself to be of 
the sons of the giants. But after this fight the Philistines made war no
 more against the Israelites.</p>
<p>3. And now David being freed from wars and dangers, and enjoying for 
the future a profound peace, (22) composed songs and hymns to God of 
several sorts of metre; some of those which he made were trimeters, and 
some were pentameters. He also made instruments of music, and taught the
 Levites to sing hymns to God, both on that called the sabbath day, and 
on other festivals. Now the construction of the instruments was thus: 
The viol was an instrument of ten strings, it was played upon with a 
bow; the psaltery had twelve musical notes, and was played upon by the 
fingers; the cymbals were broad and large instruments, and were made of 
brass. And so much shall suffice to be spoken by us about these 
instruments, that the readers may not be wholly unacquainted with their 
nature.</p>
<p>4. Now all the men that were about David were men of courage. Those 
that were most illustrious and famous of them for their actions were 
thirty-eight; of five of whom I will only relate the <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="202" data-page-number="202" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/216"></span></span>performances,
 for these will suffice to make manifest the virtues of the others also;
 for these were powerful enough to subdue countries, and conquer great 
nations. First, therefore, was Jessai, the son of Achimaas, who 
frequently leaped upon the troops of the enemy, and did not leave off 
fighting till he overthrew nine hundred of them. After him was Eleazar, 
the son of Dodo, who was with the king at Arasam. This man, when once 
the Israelites were under a consternation at the multitude of the 
Philistines, and were running away, stood alone, and fell upon the 
enemy, and slew many of them, till his sword clung to his hand by the 
blood he had shed, and till the Israelites, seeing the Philistines 
retire by his means, came down from the mountains and pursued them, and 
at that time won a surprising and a famous victory, while Eleazar slew 
the men, and the multitude followed and spoiled their dead bodies. The 
third was Sheba, the son of Ilus. Now this man, when, in the wars 
against the Philistines, they pitched their camp at a place called Lehi,
 and when the Hebrews were again afraid of their army, and did not stay,
 he stood still alone, as an army and a body of men; and some of them he
 overthrew, and some who were not able to abide his strength and force 
he pursued. These are the works of the hands, and of fighting, which 
these three performed. Now at the time when the king was once at 
Jerusalem, and the army of the Philistines came upon him to fight him, 
David went up to the top of the citadel, as we have already said, to 
inquire of God concerning the battle, while the enemy's camp lay in the 
valley that extends to the city Bethlehem, which is twenty furlongs 
distant from Jerusalem. Now David said to his companions, "We have 
excellent water in my own city, especially that which is in the pit near
 the gate," wondering if any one would bring him some of it to drink; 
but he said that he would rather have it than a great deal of money. 
When these three men heard what he said, they ran away immediately, and 
burst through the midst of their enemy's camp, and came to Bethlehem; 
and when they had drawn the water, they returned again through the 
enemy's camp to the king, insomuch that the Philistines were so 
surprised at their boldness and alacrity, that they were quiet, and did 
nothing against them, as if they despised their small number. But when 
the water was brought to the king, he would not drink it, saying, that 
it was brought by the danger and the blood of men, and that it was not 
proper on that account to drink it. But he poured it out to God, and 
gave him thanks for the salvation of the men. Next to these was Abishai,
 Joab's brother; for he in one day slew six hundred. The fifth of these 
was Benaiah, by lineage a priest; for being challenged by [two] eminent 
men in the country of Moab, he overcame them by his valor, Moreover, 
there was a man, by nation an Egyptian, who was of a vast bulk, and 
challenged him, yet did he, when he was unarmed, kill him with his own 
spear, which he threw at him; for he caught him by force, and took away 
his weapons while he was alive and fighting, and slew him with his own 
weapons. One may also add this to the forementioned actions of the same 
man, either as the principal of them in alacrity, or as resembling the 
rest. When God sent a snow, there was a lion who slipped and fell into a
 certain pit, and because the pit's mouth was narrow it was evident he 
would perish, being enclosed with the snow; so when he saw no way to get
 out and save himself, he roared. When Benaiah heard the wild beast, he 
went towards him, and coming at the noise he made, he went down into the
 mouth of the pit and smote him, as he struggled, with a stake that lay 
there, and immediately slew him. The other thirty-three were like these 
in valor also.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 13.</p>
<p>That When David Had Numbered the People, They Were Punished; and How the Divine Compassion Restrained That Punishment.</p>
<p>1. Now king David was desirous to know how many ten thousands there were of the people, but forgot the commands of Moses, (23) <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="203" data-page-number="203" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/217"></span></span>who
 told them beforehand, that if the multitude were numbered, they should 
pay half a shekel to God for every head. Accordingly the king commanded 
Joab, the captain of his host, to go and number the whole multitude; but
 when he said there was no necessity for such a numeration, he was not 
persuaded [to countermand it], but he enjoined him to make no delay, but
 to go about the numbering of the Hebrews immediately. So Joab took with
 him the heads of the tribes, and the scribes, and went over the country
 of the Israelites, and took notice how numerous the multitude were, and
 returned to Jerusalem to the king, after nine months and twenty days; 
and he gave in to the king the number of the people, without the tribe 
of Benjamin, for he had not yet numbered that tribe, no more than the 
tribe of Levi, for the king repented of his having sinned against God. 
Now the number of the rest of the Israelites was nine hundred thousand 
men, who were able to bear arms and go to war; but the tribe of Judah, 
by itself, was four hundred thousand men.</p>
<p>2. Now when the prophets had signified to David that God was angry at
 him, he began to entreat him, and to desire he would be merciful to 
him, and forgive his sin. But God sent Nathan the prophet to him, to 
propose to him the election of three things, that he might choose which 
he liked best: Whether he would have famine come upon the country for 
seven years, or would have a war, and be subdued three months by his 
enemies? or, whether God should send a pestilence and a distemper upon 
the Hebrews for three days? But as he was fallen to a fatal choice of 
great miseries, he was in trouble, and sorely confounded; and when the 
prophet had said that he must of necessity make his choice, and had 
ordered him to answer quickly, that he might declare what he had chosen 
to God, the king reasoned with himself, that in case he should ask for 
famine, he would appear to do it for others, and without danger to 
himself, since he had a great deal of corn hoarded up, but to the harm 
of others; that in case he should choose to be overcome [by his enemies]
 for three months, he would appear to have chosen war, because he had 
valiant men about him, and strong holds, and that therefore he feared 
nothing therefrom: so he chose that affliction which is common to kings 
and to their subjects, and in which the fear was equal on all sides; and
 said this beforehand, that it was much better to fall into the hands of
 God, than into those of his enemies.</p>
<p>3. When the prophet had heard this, he declared it to God; who 
thereupon sent a pestilence and a mortality upon the Hebrews; nor did 
they die after one and the same manner, nor so that it was easy to know 
what the distemper was. Now the miserable disease was one indeed, but it
 carried them off by ten thousand causes and occasions, which those that
 were afflicted could not understand; for one died upon the neck of 
another, and the terrible malady seized them before they were aware, and
 brought them to their end suddenly, some giving up the ghost 
immediately with very great pains and bitter grief, and some were worn 
away by their distempers, and had nothing remaining to be buried, but as
 soon as ever they fell were entirely macerated; some were choked, and 
greatly lamented their case, as being also stricken with a sudden 
darkness; some there were who, as they were burying a relation, fell 
down dead, without finishing the rites of the funeral. Now there 
perished of this disease, which began with the morning, and lasted till 
the hour of dinner, seventy thousand. Nay, the angel stretched out his 
hand over Jerusalem, as sending this terrible judgment upon it. But 
David had put on sackcloth, and lay upon the ground, entreating God, and
 begging that the distemper might now cease, and that he would be 
satisfied with those that had already perished. And when the king looked
 up into the air, and saw the angel carried along thereby into 
Jerusalem, with his sword drawn, he said to God, that he might justly be
 punished, who was their shepherd, but that the sheep ought to be 
preserved, as not having sinned at all; and he implored God that he 
would send his wrath upon him, and upon all his family, but spare the 
people.</p>
<p>4. When God heard his supplication, he caused the pestilence to 
cease, and sent Gad the prophet to him, and commanded him to go up 
immediately to the thrashing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite, and build an
 altar there to God, and offer sacrifices. When David heard that, he did
 not neglect his duty, but made haste to the place appointed him. Now 
Araunah was thrashing wheat; and when he saw the king and all his 
servants coming to him, he ran before, and came to him and worshipped 
him: he was by his lineage a Jebusite, but a particular friend of 
David's; and for that cause it was that, when he overthrew the city, he 
did him no harm, as we informed the reader a little before. Now Araunah 
inquired, "Wherefore is my lord come to his servant?" He answered, to 
buy of him the thrashing-floor, that he might therein build an altar to 
God, and offer a sacrifice. He replied, that he freely gave him both the
 thrashing-floor and the ploughs and the oxen for a burnt-offering; and 
he besought <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="204" data-page-number="204" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/218"></span></span>God
 graciously to accept his sacrifice. But the king made answer, that he 
took his generosity and magnanimity loudly, and accepted his good-will, 
but he desired him to take the price of them all, for that it was not 
just to offer a sacrifice that cost nothing. And when Araunah said he 
would do as he pleased, he bought the thrashing-floor of him for fifty 
shekels. And when he had built an altar, he performed Divine service, 
and brought a burnt-offering, and offered peace-offerings also. With 
these God was pacified, and became gracious to them again. Now it 
happened that Abraham (24)came and offered his son Isaac for a 
burnt-offering at that very place; and when the youth was ready to have 
his throat cut, a ram appeared on a sudden, standing by the altar, which
 Abraham sacrificed in the stead of his son, as we have before related. 
Now when king David saw that God had heard his prayer, and had 
graciously accepted of his sacrifice, he resolved to call that entire 
place The Altar of all the People, and to build a temple to God there; 
which words he uttered very appositely to what was to be done afterward;
 for God sent the prophet to him, and told him that there should his son
 build him an altar, that son who was to take the kingdom after him.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 14.</p>
<p>That David Made Great Preparations For The House Of God; And That, 
Upon Adonijah's Attempt To Gain The Kingdom, He Appointed Solomon To 
Reign.</p>
<p>1. After the delivery of this prophecy, the king commanded the 
strangers to be numbered; and they were found to be one hundred and 
eighty thousand; of these he appointed fourscore thousand to be hewers 
of stone, and the rest of the multitude to carry the stones, and of them
 he set over the workmen three thousand and five hundred. He also 
prepared a great quantity of iron and brass for the work, with many (and
 those exceeding large) cedar trees; the Tyrians and Sidonians sending 
them to him, for he had sent to them for a supply of those trees. And he
 told his friends that these things were now prepared, that he might 
leave materials ready for the building of the temple to his son, who was
 to reign after him, and that he might not have them to seek then, when 
he was very young, and by reason of his age unskillful in such matters, 
but might have them lying by him, and so might the more readily complete
 the work.</p>
<p>2. So David called his son Solomon, and charged him, when he had 
received the kingdom, to build a temple to God, and said, "!I was 
willing to build God a temple myself, but he prohibited me, because I 
was polluted with blood and wars; but he hath foretold that Solomon, my 
youngest son, should build him a temple, and should be called by that 
name; over whom he hath promised to take the like care as a father takes
 over his son; and that he would make the country of the Hebrews happy 
under him, and that, not only in other respects, but by giving it peace 
and freedom from wars, and from internal seditions, which are the 
greatest of all blessings. Since, therefore," says he, "thou wast 
ordained king by God himself before thou wast born, endeavor to render 
thyself worthy of this his providence, as in other instances, so 
particularly in being religious, and righteous, and courageous. Keep 
thou also his commands and his laws, which he hath given us by Moses, 
and do not permit others to break them. Be zealous also to dedicate to 
God a temple, which he hath chosen to be built under thy reign; nor be 
thou aftrighted by the vastness of the work, nor set about it 
timorously, for I will make all things ready before I die: and take 
notice, that there are already ten thousand talents of gold, and a 
hundred thousand talents of silver (25) collected together. I have also 
laid together brass and iron without number, and an immense quantity of 
timber and of stones. Moreover, thou hast many ten thousand 
stone-cutters and carpenters; and if thou shalt want any thing further, 
do thou add somewhat of thine own. Wherefore, if thou performest this 
work, thou wilt be acceptable to God, and have him for thy patron." 
David also further exhorted the rulers of the people to assist his son 
in this building, and to attend to the Divine service, when they should 
be free from all their misfortunes, for that they by this means should 
enjoy, instead of them, peace and a happy settlement, with which 
blessings God rewards such men as are religious and righteous. He also 
gave orders, that when the temple should be once built, they should put 
the ark therein, with the holy vessels; and he assured them that they 
ought to have had a temple long ago, if their fathers had not been 
negligent of God's commands, who had given it in charge, that when they 
had got the possession of this land, they should build him a temple. 
Thus did David discourse to the governors, and to his son.</p>
<p>3. David was now in years, and his body, by length of time, was 
become cold, and benumbed, insomuch that he could get no heat by 
covering himself with many clothes; and when the physicians came 
together, they <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="205" data-page-number="205" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/219"></span></span>agreed
 to this advice, that a beautiful virgin, chosen out of the whole 
country, should sleep by the king's side, and that this damsel would 
communicate heat to him, and be a remedy against his numbness. Now there
 was found in the city one woman, of a superior beauty to all other 
women, (her name was Abishag,) who, sleeping with the king, did no more 
than communicate warmth to him, for he was so old that he could not know
 her as a husband knows his wife. But of this woman we shall speak more 
presently.</p>
<p>4. Now the fourth son of David was a beautiful young man, and tall, 
born to him of Haggith his wife. He was named Adonijah, and was in his 
disposition like to Absalom; and exalted himself as hoping to be king, 
and told his friends that he ought to take the government upon him. He 
also prepared many chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him.
 When his father saw this, he did not reprove him, nor restrain him from
 his purpose, nor did he go so far as to ask wherefore he did so. Now 
Adonijah had for his assistants Joab the captain of the army, and 
Abiathar the high priest; and the only persons that opposed him were 
Zadok the high priest, and the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah, who was 
captain of the guards, and Shimei, David's friend, with all the other 
most mighty men. Now Adonijah had prepared a supper out of the city, 
near the fountain that was in the king's paradise, and had invited all 
his brethren except Solomon, and had taken with him Joab the captain of 
the army, and: Abiathar, and the rulers of the tribe of Judah, but had 
not invited to this feast either Zadok the high priest, or Nathan the 
prophet, or Benaiah the captain of the guards, nor any of those of the 
contrary party. This matter was told by Nathan the prophet to Bathsheba,
 Solomon's mother, that Adonijah was king, and that David knew nothing 
of it; and he advised her to save herself and her son Solomon, and to go
 by herself to David, and say to him, that he had indeed sworn that 
Solomon should reign after him, but that in the mean time Adonijah had 
already taken the kingdom. He said that he, the prophet himself, would 
come after her, and when she had spoken thus to the king, would confirm 
what she had said. Accordingly Bathsheba agreed with Nathan, and went in
 to the king and worshipped him, and when she had desired leave to speak
 with him, she told him all things in the manner that Nathan had 
suggested to her; and related what a supper Adonijah had made, and who 
they were whom he had invited; Abiathar the and Joab the general, and 
David's sons, excepting Solomon and his intimate friends. She also said 
that all the people had their eyes upon him, to know whom he would 
choose for their king. She desired him also to consider how, after his 
departure, Adonijah, if he were king, would slay her and her son 
Solomon.</p>
<p>5. Now, as Bathsheba was speaking, the keeper of the king's chambers 
told him that Nathan desired to see him. And when the king had commanded
 that he should be admitted, he came in, and asked him whether he had 
ordained Adonijah to be king, and delivered the government to him, or 
not; for that he had made a splendid supper, and invited all his sons, 
except Solomon; as also that he had invited Joab, the captain of his 
host, [and Abiathar the high priest,] who are feasting with applauses, 
and many joyful sounds of instruments, and wish that his kingdom may 
last for ever; but he hath not invited me, nor Zadok the high priest, 
nor Benaiah the captain of the guards; and it is but fit that all should
 know whether this be done by thy approbation or not. When Nathan had 
said thus, the king commanded that they should call Bathsheba to him, 
for she had gone out of the room when the prophet came. And when 
Bathsheba was come, David said, "I swear by Almighty God, that thy son 
Solomon shall certainly he king, as I formerly swore; and that he shall 
sit upon my throne, and that this very day also." So Bathsheba 
worshipped him, and wished him a long life; and the king sent for Zadok 
the high priest, and Benaiah the captain of the guards; and when they 
were come, he ordered them to take with them Nathan the prophet, and all
 the armed men about the palace, and to set his son Solomon upon the 
king's mule, and to carry him out of the city to the fountain called 
Gihon, and to anoint him there with the holy oil, and to make him king. 
This he charged Zadok the high priest, and Nathan the prophet, to do, 
and commanded them to follow Solomon through the midst of the city, and 
to sound the trumpets, and wish aloud that Solomon the king may sit upon
 the royal throne for ever, that so all the people may know that he is 
ordained king by his father. He also gave Solomon a charge concerning 
his government, to rule the whole nation of the Hebrews, and 
particularly the tribe of Judah, religiously and righteously. And when 
Benaiah had prayed to God to be favorable to Solomon, without any delay 
they set Solomon upon the mule, and brought him out of the city to the 
fountain, and anointed him with oil, and brought him into the city 
again, with acclamations and wishes that his kingdom might continue a 
long time: and when they had introduced him into the king's house, they 
set him upon the throne; whereupon all the people betook themselves to 
make merry, and to celebrate a festival, dancing and delighting 
themselves with musical pipes, till both the earth and the air echoed 
with the multitude of the instruments of music.</p>
<p>6. Now when Adonijah and his guests perceived this noise, they were 
in disorder; and Joab the captain of the host said he was not pleased 
with these echoes, and the sound of these trumpets. And when supper was 
set before them, nobody tasted of it, but they were all very thoughtful 
what would be the matter. Then <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="206" data-page-number="206" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/220"></span></span>Jonathan,
 the son of Abiathar the high priest, came running to them; and when 
Adonijah saw the young man gladly, and said to him that he was a good 
messenger, he declared to them the whole matter about Solomon, and the 
determination of king David: hereupon both Adonijah and all the guests 
rose hastily from the feast, and every one fled to their own homes. 
Adonijah also, as afraid of the king for what he had done, became a 
supplicant to God, and took hold of the horns of the altar, which were 
prominent. It was also told Solomon that he had so done; and that he 
desired to receive assurances from him that he would not remember the 
injury he had done, and not inflict any severe punishment for it. 
Solomon answered very mildly and prudently, that he forgave him this his
 offense; but said withal, that if he were found out in any attempt for 
new innovations, that he would be the author of his own punishment. So 
he sent to him, and raised him up from the place of his supplication. 
And when he was come to the king, and had worshipped him, the king bid 
him go away to his own house, and have no suspicion of any harm; and 
desired him to show himself a worthy man, as what would tend to his own 
advantage.</p>
<p>7. But David, being desirous of ordaining his son king of all the 
people, called together their rulers to Jerusalem, with the priests and 
the Levites; and having first numbered the Levites, he found them to be 
thirty-eight thousand, from thirty years old to fifty; out of which he 
appointed twenty-three thousand to take care of the building of the 
temple, and out of the same, six thousand to be judges of the people and
 scribes, four thousand for porters to the house of God, and as many for
 singers, to sing to the instruments which David had prepared, as we 
have said already. He divided them also into courses: and when he had 
separated the priests from them, he found of these priests twenty-four 
courses, sixteen of the house of Eleazar, and eight of that of Ithamar; 
and he ordained that one course should minister to God eight days, from 
sabbath to sabbath. And thus were the courses distributed by lot, in the
 presence of David, and Zadok and Abiathar the high priests, and of all 
the rulers; and that course which came up first was written down as the 
first, and accordingly the second, and so on to the twenty-fourth; and 
this partition hath remained to this day. He also made twenty-four parts
 of the tribe of Levi; and when they cast lots, they came up in the same
 manner for their courses of eight days. He also honored the posterity 
of Moses, and made them the keepers of the treasures of God, and of the 
donations which the kings dedicated. He also ordained that all the tribe
 of Levi, as well as the priests, should serve God night and day, as 
Moses had enjoined them.</p>
<p>8. After this he parted the entire army into twelve parts, with their
 leaders [and captains of hundreds] and commanders. Now every part had 
twenty-four thousand, which were ordered to wait on Solomon, by thirty 
days at a time, from the first day till the last, with the captains of 
thousands and captains of hundreds. He also set rulers over every part, 
such as he knew to be good and righteous men. He set others also to take
 charge of the treasures, and of the villages, and of the fields, and of
 the beasts, whose names I do not think it necessary to mention. When 
David had ordered all these officers after the manner before mentioned, 
he called the rulers of the Hebrews, and their heads of tribes, and the 
officers over the several divisions, and those that were appointed over 
every work, and every possession; and standing upon a high pulpit, he 
said to the multitude as follows: "My brethren and my people, I would 
have you know that I intended to build a house for God, and prepared a 
large quantity of gold, and a hundred thousand talents of silver; but 
God prohibited me by the prophet Nathan, because of the wars I had on 
your account, and because my right hand was polluted with the slaughter 
of our enemies; but he commanded that my son, who was to succeed me in 
the kingdom, should build a temple for him. Now therefore, since you 
know that of the twelve sons whom Jacob our forefather had Judah was 
appointed to be king, and that I was preferred before my six brethren, 
and received the government from God, and that none of them were uneasy 
at it, so do I also desire that my sons be not seditious one against 
another, now Solomon has received the kingdom, but to bear him 
cheerfully for their lord, as knowing that God hath chosen him; for it 
is not a grievous thing to obey even a foreigner as a ruler, if it be 
God's will, but it is fit to rejoice when a brother hath obtained that 
dignity, since the rest partake of it with him. And I pray that the 
promises of God may be fulfilled; and that this happiness which he hath 
promised to bestow upon king Solomon, over all the country, may continue
 therein for all time to come. And these promises O son, will be firm, 
and come to a happy end, if thou showest thyself to be a religious and a
 righteous man, and an observer of the laws of thy country; but if not, 
expect adversity upon thy disobedience to them."</p>
<p>9. Now when the king had said this, he left off; but gave the 
description and pattern of the building of the temple in the sight of 
them all to Solomon: of the foundations and of the chambers, inferior 
and superior; how many they were to be, and how large in height and in 
breadth; as also he determined the weight of the golden and silver 
vessels: moreover, he earnestly excited them with his words to use the 
utmost alacrity about the work; he exhorted the rulers also, and 
particularly the tribe of Levi, to assist him, both because of his 
youth, and because God had chosen him to take care of the building of 
the temple, and of the government of the kingdom. He also <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="207" data-page-number="207" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/221"></span></span>declared
 to them that the work would be easy, and not very laborious to them, 
because he had prepared for it many talents of gold, and more of silver,
 with timber, and a great many carpenters and stone-cutters, and a large
 quantity of emeralds, and all sorts of precious stones; and he said, 
that even now he would give of the proper goods of his own dominion two 
hundred talents, and three hundred other talents of pure gold, for the 
most holy place, and for the chariot of God, the cherubim, which are to 
stand over and cover the ark. Now when David had done speaking, there 
appeared great alacrity among the rulers, and the priests, and the 
Levites, who now contributed and made great and splendid promises for a 
future Contribution; for they undertook to bring of gold five thousand 
talents, and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and
 many ten thousand talents of iron; and if any one had a precious stone 
he brought it, and bequeathed it to be put among the treasures; of which
 Jachiel, one of the posterity of Moses, had the care.</p>
<p>10. Upon this occasion all the people rejoiced, as in particular did 
David, when he saw the zeal and forward ambition of the rulers, and the 
priests, and of all the rest; and he began to bless God with a loud 
voice, calling him the Father and Parent of the universe, and the Author
 of human and divine things, with which he had adorned Solomon, the 
patron and guardian of the Hebrew nation, and of its happiness, and of 
that kingdom which he hath given his son. Besides this, he prayed for 
happiness to all the people; and to Solomon his son, a sound and a 
righteous mind, and confirmed in all sorts of virtue; and then he 
commanded the multitude to bless God; upon which they all fell down upon
 the ground and worshipped him. They also gave thanks to David, on 
account of all the blessings which they had received ever since he had 
taken the kingdom. On the next day he presented sacrifices to God, a 
thousand bullocks, and as many lambs, which they offered for 
burnt-offerings. They also offered peace-offerings, and slew many ten 
thousand sacrifices; and the king feasted all day, together with all the
 people; and they anointed Solomon a second time with the oil, and 
appointed him to be king, and Zadok to be the high priest of the whole 
multitude. And when they had brought Solomon to the royal palace, and 
had set him upon his father's throne, they were obedient to him from 
that day.</p>
<p>CHAPTER 15.</p>
<p>What Charge David Gave Tohis Son Solomon At The Approach Of His 
Death, And How Many Things He Left Him For The Building Of The Temple.</p>
<p>1. A Little afterward David also fell into a distemper, by reason of 
his age; and perceiving that he was near to death, he called his son 
Solomon, and discoursed to him thus: "I am now, O my son, going to my 
grave, and to my fathers, which is the common way which all men that now
 are, or shall be hereafter, must go; from which way it is no longer 
possible to return, and to know any thing that is done in this world. On
 which account I exhort thee, while I am still alive, though already 
very near to death, in the same manner as I have formerly said in my 
advice to thee, to be righteous towards thy subjects, and religious 
towards God, that hath given thee thy kingdom; to observe his commands 
and his laws, which he hath sent us by Moses; and neither do thou out of
 favor nor flattery allow any lust or other passion to weigh with thee 
to disregard them; for if thou transgressest his laws, thou wilt lose 
the favor of God, and thou wilt turn away his providence from thee in 
all things; but if thou behave thyself so as it behooves thee, and as I 
exhort thee, thou wilt preserve our kingdom to our family, and no other 
house will bear rule over the Hebrews but we ourselves for all ages. Be 
thou also mindful of the transgressions of Joab, (26) the captain of the
 host, who hath slain two generals out of envy, and those righteous and 
good men, Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Jether; whose death
 do thou avenge as shall seem good to thee, since Joab hath been too 
hard for me, and more potent than myself, and so hath escaped pu <span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="208" data-page-number="208" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/222"></span></span>punishment
 hitherto. I also commit to thee the son of Barzillai the Gileadite, 
whom, in order to gratify me, thou shalt have in great honor, and take 
great care of; for we have not done good to him first, but we only repay
 that debt which we owe to his father for what he did to me in my 
flight. There is also Shimei the son of Gera, of the tribe of Benjamin, 
who, after he had cast many reproaches upon me, when, in my flight, I 
was going to Mahanaim, met me at Jordan, and received assurances that he
 should then suffer nothing. Do thou now seek out for some just 
occasion, and punish him."</p>
<p>2. When David had given these admonitions to his son about public 
affairs, and about his friends, and about those whom he knew to deserve 
punishment, he died, having lived seventy years, and reigned seven years
 and six months in Hebron over the tribe of Judah, and thirty-three 
years in Jerusalem over all the country. This man was of an excellent 
character, and was endowed with all virtues that were desirable in a 
king, and in one that had the preservation of so many tribes committed 
to him; for he was a man of valor in a very extraordinary degree, and 
went readily and first of all into dangers, when he was to fight for his
 subjects, as exciting the soldiers to action by his own labors, and 
fighting for them, and not by commanding them in a despotic way. He was 
also of very great abilities in understanding, and apprehension of 
present and future circumstances, when he was to manage any affairs. He 
was prudent and moderate, and kind to such as were under any calamities;
 he was righteous and humane, which are good qualities, peculiarly fit 
for kings; nor was he guilty of any offense in the exercise of so great 
an authority, but in the business of the wife of Uriah. He also left 
behind him greater wealth than any other king, either of the Hebrews or,
 of other nations, ever did.</p>
<p>3. He was buried by his son Solomon, in Jerusalem, with great 
magnificence, and with all the other funeral pomp which kings used to be
 buried with; moreover, he had great and immense wealth buried with him,
 the vastness of which may be easily conjectured at by what I shall now 
say; for a thousand and three hundred years afterward Hyrcanus the high 
priest, when he was besieged by Antiochus, that was called the Pious, 
the son of Demetrius, and was desirous of giving him money to get him to
 raise the siege and draw off his army, and having no other method of 
compassing the money, opened one room of David's sepulcher, and took out
 three thousand talents, and gave part of that sum to Antiochus; and by 
this means caused the siege to be raised, as we have informed the reader
 elsewhere. Nay, after him, and that many years, Herod the king opened 
another room, and took away a great deal of money, and yet neither of 
them came at the coffins of the kings themselves, for their bodies were 
buried under the earth so artfully, that they did not appear to even 
those that entered into their monuments. But so much shall suffice us to
 have said concerning these matters.</p>
