</p><p>Containing The Interval Of Thirty-Two Years.
</p><p>From The Death Of Eli To The Death Of Saul.
</p><p>CHAPTER 1.
</p><p>The Destruction That Came Upon The Philistines, And Upon Their Land, By The Wrath Of God On Account Of Their Having Carried The Ark Away Captive; And After What Manner They Sent It Back To The Hebrews.
</p><p>1. When the Philistines had taken the ark of the Hebrews captive, as I said a little before, they carried it to the city of Ashdod, and put it by their own god, who was called Dagon, (1) as one of their spoils; but when they went into his temple the next morning to worship their god, they found him paying the same worship to the ark, for he lay along, as having fallen down from the basis whereon he had stood: so they took him up, and set him on his basis again, and were much troubled at what had happened; and as they frequently came to Dagon and found him still lying along, in a posture of adoration to the ark, they were in very great distress and confusion. At length God sent a very destructive disease upon the city and country of Ashdod, for they died of the dysentery or flux, a sore distemper, that brought death upon them very suddenly; for before the soul could, as usual in easy deaths, be well loosed from the body, they brought up their entrails, and vomited up what they had eaten, and what was entirely corrupted by the disease. And as to the fruits of their country, a great multitude of mice arose out of the earth and hurt them, and spared neither the plants nor the fruits. Now while the people of Ashdod were under these misfortunes, and were not able to support themselves under their calamities, they perceived that they suffered thus because of the ark, and that the victory they had gotten, and their having taken the ark captive, had not happened for their good; they therefore sent to the people of Askelon, and desired that they would receive the ark among them. This desire of the people of Ashdod was not disagreeable to those of Askelon, so they granted them that favor. But when they had gotten the ark, they were in the same miserable condition; for the ark carried along with it the disasters that the people of Ashdod had suffered, to those who received it from them. Those of Askelon also sent it away from themselves to others: nor did it stay among those others neither; for since they were pursued by the same disasters, they still sent it to the neighboring cities; so that the ark went round, after this manner, to the five cities of the Philistines, as though it&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="149" data-page-number="149" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/163"></span></span>exacted these disasters as a tribute to be paid it for
its coming among them.
</p><p>2. When those that had experienced these miseries were tired out
with them, and when those that heard of them were taught thereby
not to admit the ark among them, since they paid so dear a
tribute for it, at length they sought for some contrivance and
method how they might get free from it: so the governors of the
five cities, Gath, and Ekron, and Askelon, as also of Gaza, and
Ashclod, met together, and considered what was fit to be done;
and at first they thought proper to send the ark back to its own
people, as allowing that God had avenged its cause; that the
miseries they had undergone came along with it, and that these
were sent on their cities upon its account, and together with it.
However, there were those that said they should not do so, nor
suffer themselves to be deluded, as ascribing the cause of their
miseries to it, because it could not have such power and force
upon them; for, had God had such a regard to it, it would not
have been delivered into the hands of men. So they exhorted them
to be quiet, and to take patiently what had befallen them, and to
suppose there was no other cause of it but nature, which, at
certain revolutions of time, produces such mutations in the
bodies of men, in the earth, in plants, and in all things that
grow out of the earth. But the counsel that prevailed over those
already described, was that of certain men, who were believed to
have distinguished themselves in former times for their
understanding and prudence, and who, in their present
circumstances, seemed above all the rest to speak properly. These
men said it was not right either to send the ark away, or to
retain it, but to dedicate five golden images, one for every
city, as a thank-offering to God, on account of his having taken
care of their preservation, and having kept them alive when their
lives were likely to be taken away by such distempers as they
were not able to bear up against. They also would have them make
five golden mice like to those that devoured and destroyed their
country (2) to put them in a bag, and lay them upon the ark; to
make them a new cart also for it, and to yoke milch kine to it
(3) but to shut up their calves, and keep them from them, lest,
by following after them, they should prove a hinderance to their
dams, and that the dams might return the faster out of a desire
of those calves; then to drive these milch kine that carried the
ark, and leave it at a place where three ways met, and So leave
it to the kine to go along which of those ways they pleased; that
in case they went the way to the Hebrews, and ascended to their
country, they should suppose that the ark was the cause of their
misfortunes; but if they turned into another road, they said, "We
will pursue after it, and conclude that it has no such force in
it."
</p><p>3. So they determined that these men spake well; and they
immediately confirmed their opinion by doing accordingly. And
when they had done as has been already described, they brought
the cart to a place where three ways met, and left it there and
went their ways; but the kine went the right way, and as if some
persons had driven them, while the rulers of the Philistines
followed after them, as desirous to know where they would stand
still, and to whom they would go. Now there was a certain village
of the tribe of Judah, the name of which was Bethshemesh, and to
that village did the kine go; and though there was a great and
good plain before them to proceed in, they went no farther, but
stopped the cart there. This was a sight to those of that
village, and they were very glad; for it being then summer-time,
and all the inhabitants being then in the fields gathering in
their fruits, they left off the labors of their hands for joy, as
soon as they saw the ark, and ran to the cart, and taking the ark
down, and the vessel that had the images in it, and the mice,
they set them upon a certain rock which was in the plain; and
when they had offered a splendid sacrifice to God, and feasted,
they offered the cart and the kine as a burnt-offering: and when
the lords of the Philistines saw this, they returned back.
</p><p>4. But now it was that the wrath of God overtook them, and struck
seventy persons of the village of Bethshemesh dead, who, not
being priests, and so not worthy to touch the ark, had approached
to it. Those of that village wept for these that had thus
suffered, and made such a lamentation as was naturally to be
expected on so great a misfo&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="150" data-page-number="150" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/164"></span></span>rtune that was sent from God; and
every one mourned for his own relation. And since they
acknowledged themselves unworthy of the ark's abode with them,
they sent to the public senate of the Israelites, and informed
them that the ark was restored by the Philistines; which when
they knew, they brought it away to Kirjathjearim, a city in the
neighborhood of Bethshemesh. In this city lived one Abinadab, by
birth a Levite, and who was greatly commended for his righteous
and religious course of life; so they brought the ark to his
house, as to a place fit for God himself to abide in, since
therein did inhabit a righteous man. His sons also ministered to
the Divine service at the ark, and were the principal curators of
it for twenty years; for so many years it continued in
Kirjathjearim, having been but four months with the Philistines.
</p><p>CHAPTER 2.
</p><p>The Expedition Of The Philistines Against The Hebrews And The
Hebrews' Victory Under The Conduct Of Samuel The Prophet, Who Was
Their General.
</p><p>1. Now while the city of Kirjathjearim had the ark with them, the
whole body of the people betook themselves all that time to offer
prayers and sacrifices to God, and appeared greatly concerned and
zealous about his worship. So Samuel the prophet, seeing how
ready they were to do their duty, thought this a proper time to
speak to them, while they were in this good disposition, about
the recovery of their liberty, and of the blessings that
accompanied the same. Accordingly he used such words to them as
he thought were most likely to excite that inclination, and to
persuade them to attempt it: "O you Israelites," said he, "to
whom the Philistines are still grievous enemies, but to whom God
begins to be gracious, it behooves you not only to be desirous of
liberty, but to take the proper methods to obtain it. Nor are you
to be contented with an inclination to get clear of your lords
and masters, while you still do what will procure your
continuance under them. Be righteous then, and cast wickedness
out of your souls, and by your worship supplicate the Divine
Majesty with all your hearts, and persevere in the honor you pay
to him; for if you act thus, you will enjoy prosperity; you will
be freed from your slavery, and will get the victory over your
enemies: which blessings it is not possible you should attain,
either by weapons of war, or by the strength of your bodies, or
by the multitude of your assistants; for God has not promised to
grant these blessings by those means, but by being good and
righteous men; and if you will be such, I will be security to you
for the performance of God's promises." When Samuel had said
thus, the multitude applauded his discourse, and were pleased
with his exhortation to them, and gave their consent to resign
themselves up to do what was pleasing to God. So Samuel gathered
them together to a certain city called Mizpeh, which, in the
Hebrew tongue, signifies a watch-tower; there they drew water,
and poured it out to God, and fasted all day, and betook
themselves to their prayers.
</p><p>2. This their assembly did not escape the notice of the
Philistines: so when they had learned that so large a company had
met together, they fell upon the Hebrews with a great army and
mighty forces, as hoping to assault them when they did not expect
it, nor were prepared for it. This thing affrighted the Hebrews,
and put them into disorder and terror; so they came running to
Samuel, and said that their souls were sunk by their fears, and
by the former defeat they had received, and "that thence it was
that we lay still, lest we should excite the power of our enemies
against us. Now while thou hast brought us hither to offer up our
prayers and sacrifices, and take oaths [to be obedient], our
enemies are making an expedition against us, while we are naked
and unarmed; wherefore we have no other hope of deliverance but
that by thy means, and by the assistance God shall afford us upon
thy prayers to him, we shall obtain deliverance from the
Philistines." Hereupon Samuel bade them be of good cheer, and
promised them that God would assist them; and taking a sucking
lamb, he sacrificed it for the multitude, and besought God to
hold his protecting hand over them when they should fight with
the Philistines, and not to overlook them, nor suffer them to
come under a second misfortune. Accordingly God hearkened to his
prayers, and accepting their sacrifice with a gracious intention,
and such as was disposed to assist them, he granted them victory
and power over their enemies. Now while the altar had the
sacrifice of God upon it, and had not yet consumed it wholly by
its sacred fire, the enemy's army marched out of their camp, and
was put in order of battle, and this in hope that they should be
conquerors, since the Jews (5) were caught in distressed
circumstances, as neither having their weapons with them, nor
being assembled there in order to fight. But things so fell out,
that they would hardly have been credited though they had been
foretold by anybody: for, in the first place, God disturbed their
enemies with an earthquake, and moved the ground under them to
such a degree, that he caused it to tremble, and made them to
shake, insomuch that by its trembling, he made some unable to
keep their feet, and made them fall down, and by opening its
chasms, he caused that others should be hurried down into them;
after which he caused such a noise of thunder to come among them,
and made fiery&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="151" data-page-number="151" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/165"></span></span>lightning shine so terribly round about them, that
it was ready to burn their faces; and he so suddenly shook their
weapons out of their hands, that he made them fly and return home
naked. So Samuel with the multitude pursued them to Bethcar, a
place so called; and there he set up a stone as a boundary of
their victory and their enemies' flight, and called it the Stone
of Power, as a signal of that power God had given them against
their enemies.
</p><p>3. So the Philistines, after this stroke, made no more
expeditions against the Israelites, but lay still out of fear,
and out of remembrance of what had befallen them; and what
courage the Philistines had formerly against the Hebrews, that,
after this victory, was transferred to the Hebrews. Samuel also
made an expedition against the Philistines, and slew many of
them, and entirely humbled their proud hearts, and took from them
that country, which, when they were formerly conquerors in
battle, they had cut off from the Jews, which was the country
that extended from the borders of Gath to the city of Ekron: but
the remains of the Canaanites were at this time in friendship
with the Israelites.
</p><p>CHAPTER 3.
</p><p>How Samuel When He Was So Infirm With Old Age That He Could Not
Take Care Of The Public Affairs Intrusted Them To His Sons; And
How Upon The Evil Administration Of The Government By Them The
Multitude Were So Angry, That They Required To Have A King To
Govern Them, Although Samuel Was Much Displeased Thereat.
</p><p>1. But Samuel the prophet, when he had ordered the affairs of the
people after a convenient manner, and had appointed a city for
every district of them, he commanded them to come to such cities,
to have the controversies that they had one with another
determined in them, he himself going over those cities twice in a
year, and doing them justice; and by that means he kept them in
very good order for a long time.
</p><p>2. But afterwards he found himself oppressed with old age, and
not able to do what he used to do, so he committed the government
and the care of the multitude to his sons, - the elder of whom
was called Joel, and the name of the younger was Abiah. He also
enjoined them to reside and judge the people, the one at the city
of Bethel, and the other at Beersheba, and divided the people
into districts that should be under the jurisdiction of each of
them. Now these men afford us an evident example and
demonstration how some children are not of the like dispositions
with their parents; but sometimes perhaps good and moderate,
though born of wicked parents; and sometimes showing themselves
to be wicked, though born of good parents: for these men turning
aside from their father's good courses, and taking a course that
was contrary to them, perverted justice for the 'filthy lucre of
gifts and bribes, and made their determinations not according to
truth, but according to bribery, and turned aside to luxury, and
a costly way of living; so that as, in the first place, they
practiced what was contrary to the will of God, so did they, in
the second place, what was contrary to the will of the prophet
their father, who had taken a great deal of care, and made a very
careful provision that the multitude should be righteous.
</p><p>3. But the people, upon these injuries offered to their former
constitution and government by the prophet's sons, were very
uneasy at their actions, and came running to the prophet, who
then lived at the city Ramah, and informed him of the
transgressions of his sons; and said, That as he was himself old
already, and too infirm by that age of his to oversee their
affairs in the manner he used to do, so they begged of him, and
entreated him, to appoint some person to be king over them, who
might rule over the nation, and avenge them of the Philistines,
who ought to be punished for their former oppressions. These
words greatly afflicted Samuel, on account of his innate love of
justice, and his hatred to kingly government, for he was very
fond of an aristocracy, as what made the men that used it of a
divine and happy disposition; nor could he either think of eating
or sleeping, out of his concern and torment of mind at what they
had said, but all the night long did he continue awake and
revolved these notions in his mind.
</p><p>4. While he was thus disposed, God appeared to him, and comforted
him, saying, That he ought not to be uneasy at what the multitude
desired, because it was not he, but Himself whom they so
insolently despised, and would not have to be alone their king;
that they had been contriving these things from the very day that
they came out of Egypt; that however in no long time they would
sorely repent of what they did, which repentance yet could not
undo what was thus done for futurity; that they would be
sufficiently rebuked for their contempt, and the ungrateful
conduct they have used towards me, and towards thy prophetic
office. "So I command thee to ordain them such a one as I shall
name beforehand to be their king, when thou hast first described
what mischiefs kingly government will bring upon them, and openly
testified before them into what a great change of affairs they
are hasting."
</p><p>5. When Samuel had heard this, he called the Jews early in the
morning, and confessed to them that he was to ordain them a king;
but he said that he was first to describe to them what would
follow, what treatment they would receive from their kings, and
with how many mischiefs they must struggle. "For know ye," said
he, "that, in the first place, they will take your sons away from
you, and they will&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="152" data-page-number="152" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/166"></span></span>command some of them to be drivers of their
chariots, and some to be their horsemen, and the guards of their
body, and others of them to be runners before them, and captains
of thousands, and captains of hundreds; they will also make them
their artificers, makers of armor, and of chariots, and of
instruments; they will make them their husbandmen also, and the
curators of their own fields, and the diggers of their own
vineyards; nor will there be any thing which they will not do at
their commands, as if they were slaves bought with money. They
will also appoint your daughters to be confectioners, and cooks,
and bakers; and these will be obliged to do all sorts of work
which women slaves, that are in fear of stripes and torments,
submit to. They will, besides this, take away your possessions,
and bestow them upon their eunuchs, and the guards of their
bodies, and will give the herds of your cattle to their own
servants: and to say briefly all at once, you, and all that is
yours, will be servants to your king, and will become no way
superior to his slaves; and when you suffer thus, you will
thereby be put in mind of what I now say. And when you repent of
what you have done, you will beseech God to have mercy upon you,
and to grant you a quick deliverance from your kings; but he will
not accept your prayers, but will neglect you, and permit you to
suffer the punishment your evil conduct has deserved."
</p><p>6. But the multitude was still so foolish as to be deaf to these
predictions of what would befall them; and too peevish to suffer
a determination which they had injudiciously once made, to be
taken out of their mind; for they could not be turned from their
purpose, nor did they regard the words of Samuel, but
peremptorily insisted on their resolution, and desired him to
ordain them a king immediately, and not trouble himself with
fears of what would happen hereafter, for that it was necessary
they should have with them one to fight their battles, and to
avenge them of their enemies, and that it was no way absurd, when
their neighbors were under kingly government, that they should
have the same form of government also. So when Samuel saw that
what he had said had not diverted them from their purpose, but
that they continued resolute, he said, "Go you every one home for
the present; when it is fit I will send for you, as soon as I
shall have learned from God who it is that he will give you for
your king."
</p><p>CHAPTER 4.
</p><p>The Appointment Of A King Over The Israelites, Whose Name Was
Saul; And This By The Command Of God.
</p><p>1. Ther was one of the tribe of Benjamin, a man of a good family,
and of a virtuous disposition; his name was Kish. He had a son, a
young man of a comely countenance, and of a tall body, but his
understanding and his mind were preferable to what was visible in
him: they called him Saul. Now this Kish had some fine she-asses
that were wandered out of the pasture wherein they fed, for he
was more delighted with these than with any other cattle he had;
so he sent out his son, and one servant with him, to search for
the beasts; but when he had gone over his own tribe in search
after the asses, he went to other tribes, and when he found them
not there neither, he determined to go his way home, lest he
should occasion any concern to his father about himself. But when
his servant that followed him told him as they were near the city
of Ramah, that there was a true prophet in that city, and advised
him to go to him, for that by him they should know the upshot of
the affair of their asses, he replied, That if they should go to
him, they had nothing to give him as a reward for his prophecy,
for their subsistence money was spent. The servant answered, that
he had still the fourth part of a shekel, and he would present
him with that; for they were mistaken out of ignorance, as not
knowing that the prophet received no such reward (6) So they went
to him; and when they were before the gates, they lit upon
certain maidens that were going to fetch water, and they asked
them which was the prophet's house. They showed them which it
was; and bid them make haste before he sat down to supper, for he
had invited many guests to a feast, and that he used to sit down
before those that were invited. Now Samuel had then gathered many
together to feast with him on this very account; for while he
every day prayed to God to tell him beforehand whom he would make
king, he had informed him of this man the day before, for that he
would send him a certain young man out of the tribe of Benjamin
about this hour of the day; and he sat on the top of the house in
expectation of that time's being come. And when the time was
completed, he came down and went to supper; so he met with Saul,
and God discovered to him that this was he who should rule over
them. Then Saul went up to Samuel and saluted him, and desired
him to inform him which was the prophet's house; for he said he
was a stranger and did not know it. When Samuel had told him that
he himself was the person, he led him in to supper, and assured
him that the asses were found which he had been to seek, and that
the greatest of good things were assured to him: he replied, "I
am too inconsiderable to hope for any such thing, and of a tribe
to small to have kings made out of it, and of a family smaller
than several other families; but thou tellest me this in jest,
and makest me an object of laughter, when thou discoursest with
me of greater matters than what I stand in need of." However, the
prophet led him in to the feast, and made him sit down, him and
his servant that followed him,&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="153" data-page-number="153" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/167"></span></span>above the other guests that were
invited, which were seventy in number (7) and he gave orders to
the servants to set the royal portion before Saul. And when the
time of going to bed was come, the rest rose up, and every one of
them went home; but Saul staid with the prophet, he and his
servant, and slept with him.
</p><p>2. Now as soon as it was day, Samuel raised up Saul out of his
bed, and conducted him homeward; and when he was out of the city,
he desired him to cause his servant to go before, but to stay
behind himself, for that he had somewhat to say to him when
nobody else was present. Accordingly, Saul sent away his servant
that followed him; then did the prophet take a vessel of oil, and
poured it upon the head of the young man, and kissed him, and
said, "Be thou a king, by the ordination of God, against the
Philistines, and for avenging the Hebrews for what they have
suffered by them; of this thou shalt have a sign, which I would
have thee take notice of: - As soon as thou art departed hence,
thou will find three men upon the road, going to worship God at
Bethel; the first of whom thou wilt see carrying three loaves of
bread, the second carrying a kid of the goats, and the third will
follow them carrying a bottle of wine. These three men will
salute thee, and speak kindly to thee, and will give thee two of
their loaves, which thou shalt accept of. And thence thou shalt
come to a place called Rachel's Monument, where thou shalt meet
with those that will tell thee thy asses are found; after this,
when thou comest to Gabatha, thou shalt overtake a company of
prophets, and thou shalt be seized with the Divine Spirit, (8)
and prophesy along with them, till every one that sees thee shall
be astonished, and wonder, and say, Whence is it that the son of
Kish has arrived at this degree of happiness? And when these
signs have happened to thee, know that God is with thee; then do
thou salute thy father and thy kindred. Thou shalt also come when
I send for thee to Gilgal, that we may offer thank-offerings to
God for these blessings." When Samuel had said this, and foretold
these things, he sent the young man away. Now all things fell out
to Saul according to the prophecy of Samuel.
</p><p>3. But as soon as Saul came into the house of his kinsman Abner,
whom indeed he loved better than the rest of his relations, he
was asked by him concerning his journey, and what accidents
happened to him therein; and he concealed none of the other
things from him, no, not his coming to Samuel the prophet, nor
how he told him the asses were found; but he said nothing to him
about the kingdom, and what belonged thereto, which he thought
would procure him envy, and when such things are heard, they are
not easily believed; nor did he think it prudent to tell those
things to him, although he appeared very friendly to him, and one
whom he loved above the rest of his relations, considering, I
suppose, what human nature really is, that no one is a firm
friend, neither among our intimates, nor of our kindred; nor do
they preserve that kind disposition when God advances men to
great prosperity, but they are still ill-natured and envious at
those that are in eminent stations.
</p><p>4. Then Samuel called the people together to the city Mizpeh, and
spake to them in the words following, which he said he was to
speak by the command of God: - That when he had granted them a
state of liberty, and brought their enemies into subjection, they
were become unmindful of his benefits, and rejected God that he
should not be their King, as not considering that it would be
most for their advantage to be presided over by the best of
beings, for God is the best of beings, and they chose to have a
man for their king; while kings will use their subjects as
beasts, according to the violence of their own wills and
inclinations, and other passions, as wholly carried away with the
lust of power, but will not endeavor so to preserve the race of
mankind as his own workmanship and creation, which, for that very
reason, God would take cake of. "But since you have come to a
fixed resolution, and this injurious treatment of God has quite
prevailed over you, dispose yourselves by your tribes and
scepters, and cast lots."
</p><p>5. When the Hebrews had so done, the lot fell upon the tribe of
Benjamin; and when the lot was cast for the families of this
tribe, that which was called Matri was taken; and when the lot
was cast for the single persons of that family, Saul, the son of
Kish, was taken for their king. When the young man knew this, he
prevented [their sending for him], and immediately went away and
hid himself. I suppose that it was because he would not have it
thought that he willingly took the government upon him; nay, he
showed such a degree of command over himself, and of modesty,
that while the greatest part are not able to contain their joy,
even in the gaining of small advantages, but presently show
themselves publicly to all men, this man did not only show
nothing of that nature, when he was appointed to be the lord of
so many and so great tribes, but crept away and concealed himself
out of the sight of those he was to reign over, and made them
seek him, and that with a good deal&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="154" data-page-number="154" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/168"></span></span>of trouble. So when the
people were at a loss, and solicitous, because Saul disappeared,
the prophet besought God to show where the young man was, and to
produce him before them. So when they had learned of God the
place where Saul was hidden, they sent men to bring him; and when
he was come, they set him in the midst of the multitude. Now he
was taller than any of them, and his stature was very majestic.
</p><p>6. Then said the prophet, God gives you this man to be your king:
see how he is higher than any of the people, and worthy of this
dominion." So as soon as the people had made acclamation, God
save the king, the prophet wrote down what would come to pass in
a book, and read it in the hearing of the king, and laid up the
book in the tabernacle of God, to be a witness to future
generations of what he had foretold. So when Samuel had finished
this matter, he dismissed the multitude, and came himself to the
city Rainah, for it was his own country. Saul also went away to
Gibeah, where he was born; and many good men there were who paid
him the respect that was due to him; but the greater part were
ill men, who despised him and derided the others, who neither did
bring him presents, nor did they in affection, or even in words,
regard to please him.
</p><p>CHAPTER 5.
</p><p>Saul's Expedition Against The Nation Of The Ammonites And Victory
Over Them And The Spoils He Took From Them.
</p><p>1. After one month, the war which Saul had with Nahash, the king
of the Ammonites, obtained him respect from all the people; for
this Nahash had done a great deal of mischief to the Jews that
lived beyond Jordan by the expedition he had made against them
with a great and warlike army. He also reduced their cities into
slavery, and that not only by subduing them for the present,
which he did by force and violence, but by weakening them by
subtlety and cunning, that they might not be able afterward to
get clear of the slavery they were under to him; for he put out
the right eyes (9) of those that either delivered themselves to
him upon terms, or were taken by him in war; and this he did,
that when their left eyes were covered by their shields, they
might be wholly useless in war. Now when the king of the
Ammonites had served those beyond Jordan in this manner, he led
his army against those that were called Gileadites, and having
pitched his camp at the metropolis of his enemies, which was the
city of Jabesh, he sent ambassadors to them, commanding them
either to deliver themselves up, on condition to have their right
eyes plucked out, or to undergo a siege, and to have their cities
overthrown. He gave them their choice, whether they would cut off
a small member of their body, or universally perish. However, the
Gileadites were so affrighted at these offers, that they had not
courage to say any thing to either of them, neither that they
would deliver themselves up, nor that they would fight him. But
they desired that he would give them seven days' respite, that
they might send ambassadors to their countrymen, and entreat
their assistance; and if they came to assist them, they would
fight; but if that assistance were impossible to be obtained from
them, they said they would deliver themselves up to suffer
whatever he pleased to inflict upon them.
</p><p>2. So Nabash, contemning the multitude of the Gileadites and the
answer they gave, allowed them a respite, and gave them leave to
send to whomsoever they pleased for assistance. So they
immediately sent to the Israelites, city by city, and informed
them what Nabash had threatened to do to them, and what great
distress they were in. Now the people fell into tears and grief
at the hearing of what the ambassadors from Jabesh said; and the
terror they were in permitted them to do nothing more. But when
the messengers were come to the city of king Saul, and declared
the dangers in which the inhabitants of Jabesh were, the people
were in the same affliction as those in the other cities, for
they lamented the calamity of those related to them. And when
Saul was returned from his husbandry into the city, he found his
fellow citizens weeping; and when, upon inquiry, he had learned
the cause of the confusion and sadness they were in, he was
seized with a divine fury, and sent away the ambassadors from the
inhabitants of Jabesh, and promised them to come to their
assistance on the third day, and to beat their enemies before
sun-rising, that the sun upon its rising might see that they had
already conquered, and were freed from the fears they were under:
but he bid some of them stay to conduct them the right way to
Jabesh.
</p><p>3. So being desirous to turn the people to this war against the
Ammonites by fear of the losses they should otherwise undergo,
and that they might the more suddenly be gathered together, he
cut the sinews of his oxen, and threatened to do the same to all
such as did not come with their armor to Jordan the next day, and
follow him and Samuel the prophet whithersoever they should lead
them. So they came together, out of fear of the losses they were
threatened with, at the appointed time. And the multitude were
numbered at the city Bezek. And he found the number of those that
were gathered together, besides that of the tribe of Judah, to be
seven hundred thousand, while those of that tribe were seventy
thousand. So he passed over Jordan, and proceeded in marching all
that night, thirty f&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="155" data-page-number="155" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/169"></span></span>urlongs, and came to Jabesh before
sun-rising. So he divided the army into three companies; and fell
upon their enemies on every side on the sudden, and when they
expected no such thing; and joining battle with them, they slew a
great many of the Ammonites, as also their king Nabash. This
glorious action was done by Saul, and was related with great
commendation of him to all the Hebrews; and he thence gained a
wonderful reputation for his valor: for although there were some
of them that contemned him before, they now changed their minds,
and honored him, and esteemed him as the best of men: for he did
not content himself with having saved the inhabitants of Jabesh
only, but he made an expedition into the country of the
Ammonites, and laid it all waste, and took a large prey, and so
returned to his own country most gloriously. So the people were
greatly pleased at these excellent performances of Saul, and
rejoiced that they had constituted him their king. They also made
a clamor against those that pretended he would be of no advantage
to their affairs; and they said, Where now are these men? - let
them be brought to punishment, with all the like things that
multitudes usually say when they are elevated with prosperity,
against those that lately had despised the authors of it. But
Saul, although he took the good-will and the affection of these
men very kindly, yet did he swear that he would not see any of
his countrymen slain that day, since it was absurd to mix this
victory, which God had given them, with the blood and slaughter
of those that were of the same lineage with themselves; and that
it was more agreeable to be men of a friendly disposition, and so
to betake themselves to feasting.
</p><p>4. And when Samuel had told them that he ought to confirm the
kingdom to Saul by a second ordination of him, they all came
together to the city of Gilgal, for thither did he command them
to come. So the prophet anointed Saul with the holy oil in the
sight of the multitude, and declared him to be king the second
time. And so the government of the Hebrews was changed into a
regal government; for in the days of Moses, and his disciple
Joshua, who was their general, they continued under an
aristocracy; but after the death of Joshua, for eighteen years in
all, the multitude had no settled form of government, but were in
an anarchy; after which they returned to their former government,
they then permitting themselves to be judged by him who appeared
to be the best warrior and most courageous, whence it was that
they called this interval of their government the Judges.
</p><p>5. Then did Samuel the prophet call another assembly also, and
said to them," I solemnly adjure you by God Almighty, who brought
those excellent brethren, I mean Moses and Aaron, into the world,
and delivered our fathers from the Egyptians, and from the
slavery they endured under them, that you will not speak what
you say to gratify me, nor suppress any thing out of fear of me,
nor be overborne by any other passion, but say, What have I ever
done that was cruel or unjust? or what have I done out of lucre
or covetousness, or to gratify others? Bear witness against me,
if I have taken an ox or a sheep, or any such thing, which yet
when they are taken to support men, it is esteemed blameless; or
have I taken an ass for mine own use of any one to his grief? -
lay some one such crime to my charge, now we are in your king's
presence." But they cried out, that no such thing had been done
by him, but that he had presided over the nation after a holy and
righteous manner.
</p><p>6. Hereupon Samuel, when such a testimony had been given him by
them all, said, "Since you grant that you are not able to lay any
ill thing to my charge hitherto, come on now, and do you hearken
while I speak with great freedom to you. You have been guilty of
great impiety against God, in asking you a king. It behoves you
to remember that our grandfather Jacob came down into Egypt, by
reason of a famine, with seventy souls only of our family, and
that their posterity multiplied there to many ten thousands, whom
the Egyptians brought into slavery and hard oppression; that God
himself, upon the prayers of our fathers, sent Moses and Aaron,
who were brethren, and gave them power to deliver the multitude
out of their distress, and this without a king. These brought us
into this very land which you now possess: and when you enjoyed
these advantages from God, you betrayed his worship and religion;
nay, moreover, when you were brought under the hands of your
enemies, he delivered you, first by rendering you superior to the
Assyrians and their forces, he then made you to overcome the
Ammonites and the Moabites, and last of all the Philistines; and
these things have been achieved under the conduct of Jephtha and
Gideon. What madness therefore possessed you to fly from God, and
to desire to be under a king? - yet have I ordained him for king
whom he chose for you. However, that I may make it plain to you
that God is angry and displeased at your choice of kingly
government, I will so dispose him that he shall declare this very
plainly to you by strange signals; for what none of you ever saw
here before, I mean a winter storm in the midst of harvest, (10)
I will entreat of God, and will make it visible to you." Now, as
soon as he had said this, God gave such great signals by thunder
and lightning, and the descent of hail, as attested the truth of
all that the prophet had said, insomuch that they were amazed and
terrified, and confessed they had sinned, and had fallen into
that sin&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="156" data-page-number="156" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/170"></span></span>through ignorance; and besought the prophet, as one that
was a tender and gentle father to them, to render God so merciful
as to forgive this their sin, which they had added to those other
offenses whereby they had affronted him and transgressed against
him. So he promised them that he would beseech God, and persuade
him to forgive them these their sins. However, he advised them to
be righteous, and to be good, and ever to remember the miseries
that had befallen them on account of their departure from virtue:
as also to remember the strange signs God had shown them, and the
body of laws that Moses had given them, if they had any desire of
being preserved and made happy with their king. But he said, that
if they should grow careless of these things, great judgments
would come from God upon them, and upon their king. And when
Samuel had thus prophesied to the Hebrews, he dismissed them to
their own homes, having confirmed the kingdom to Saul the second
time.
</p><p>CHAPTER 6.
</p><p>How The Philistines Made Another Expedition Against The Hebrews
And Were Beaten.
</p><p>1. Now Saul chose out of the multitude about three thousand men,
and he took two thousand of them to be the guards of his own
body, and abode in the city Bethel, but he gave the rest of them
to Jonathan his son, to be the guards of his body; and sent him
to Gibeah, where he besieged and took a certain garrison of the
Philistines, not far from Gilgal; for the Philistines of Gibeah
had beaten the Jews, and taken their weapons away, and had put
garrisons into the strongest places of the country, and had
forbidden them to carry any instrument of iron, or at all to make
use of any iron in any case whatsoever. And on account of this
prohibition it was that the husbandmen, if they had occasion to
sharpen any of their tools, whether it were the coulter or the
spade, or any instrument of husbandry, they came to the
Philistines to do it. Now as soon as the Philistines heard of
this slaughter of their garrison, they were in a rage about it,
and, looking on this contempt as a terrible affront offered them,
they made war against the Jews, with three hundred thousand
footmen, and thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horses;
and they pitched their camp at the city Michmash. When Saul, the
king of the Hebrews, was informed of this, he went down to the
city Gilgal, and made proclamation over all the country, that
they should try to regain their liberty; and called them to the
war against the Philistines, diminishing their forces, and
despising them as not very considerable, and as not so great but
they might hazard a battle with them. But when the people about
Saul observed how numerous the Philistines were, they were under
a great consternation; and some of them hid themselves in caves
and in dens under ground, but the greater part fled into the land
beyond Jordan, which belonged to Gad and Reuben.
</p><p>2. But Saul sent to the prophet, and called him to consult with
him about the war and the public affairs; so he commanded him to
stay there for him, and to prepare sacrifices, for he would come
to him within seven days, that they might offer sacrifices on the
seventh day, and might then join battle with their enemies. So he
waited (11) as the prophet sent to him to do; yet did not he,
however, observe the command that was given him, but when he saw
that the prophet tarried longer than he expected, and that he was
deserted by the soldiers, he took the sacrifices and offered
them; and when he heard that Samuel was come, he went out to meet
him. But the prophet said he had not done well in disobeying the
injunctions he had sent to him, and had not staid till his
coming, which being appointed according&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="157" data-page-number="157" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/171"></span></span>to the will of God, he
had prevented him in offering up those prayers and those
sacrifices that he should have made for the multitude, and that
he therefore had performed Divine offices in an ill manner, and
had been rash in performing them. Hereupon Saul made an apology
for himself, and said that he had waited as many days as Samuel
had appointed him; that he had been so quick in offering his
sacrifices, upon account of the necessity he was in, and because
his soldiers were departing from him, out of their fear of the
enemy's camp at Michmash, the report being gone abroad that they
were coming down upon him of Gilgal. To which Samuel replied,
"Nay, certainly, if thou hadst been a righteous man, (12) and
hadst not disobeyed me, nor slighted the commands which God
suggested to me concerning the present state of affairs, and
hadst not acted more hastily than the present circumstances
required, thou wouldst have been permitted to reign a long time,
and thy posterity after thee." So Samuel, being grieved at what
happened, returned home; but Saul came to the city Gibeah, with
his son Jonathan, having only six hundred men with him; and of
these the greater part had no weapons, because of the scarcity of
iron in that country, as well as of those that could make such
weapons; for, as we showed a little before, the Philistines had
not suffered them to have such iron or such workmen. Now the
Philistines divided their army into three companies, and took as
many roads, and laid waste the country of the Hebrews, while king
Saul and his son Jonathan saw what was done, but were not able to
defend the land, having no more than six hundred men with them.
But as he, and his son, and Abiah the high priest, who was of the
posterity of Eli the high priest, were sitting upon a pretty high
hill, and seeing the land laid waste, they were mightily
disturbed at it. Now Saul's son agreed with his armor-bearer,
that they would go privately to the enemy's camp, and make a
tumult and a disturbance among them. And when the armor-bearer
had readily promised to follow him whithersoever he should lead
him, though he should be obliged to die in the attempt, Jonathan
made use of the young man's assistance, and descended from the
hill, and went to their enemies. Now the enemy's camp was upon a
precipice which had three tops, that ended in a small but sharp
and long extremity, while there was a rock that surrounded them,
like lines made to prevent the attacks of an enemy. There it so
happened, that the out-guards of the camp were neglected, because
of the security that here arose from the situation of the place,
and because they thought it altogether impossible, not only to
ascend up to the camp on that quarter, but so much as to come
near it. As soon, therefore, as they came to the camp, Jonathan
encouraged his armor-bearer, and said to him, "Let us attack our
enemies; and if, when they see us, they bid us come up to them,
take that for a signal of victory; but if they say nothing, as
not intending to invite us to come up, let us return back again."
So when they were approaching to the enemy's camp, just after
break of day, and the Philistines saw them, they said one to
another, "The Hebrews come out of their dens and caves:" and they
said to Jonathan and to his armor-bearer, "Come on, ascend up to
us, that we may inflict a just punishment upon you, for your rash
attempt upon us." So Saul's son accepted of that invitation, as
what signified to him victory, and he immediately came out of the
place whence they were seen by their enemies: so he changed his
place, and came to the rock, which had none to guard it, because
of its own strength; from thence they crept up with great labor
and difficulty, and so far overcame by force the nature of the
place, till they were able to fight with their enemies. So they
fell upon them as they were asleep, and slew about twenty of
them, and thereby filled them with disorder and surprise,
insomuch that some of them threw away their entire armor and
fled; but the greatest part, not knowing one another, because
they were of different nations, suspected one another to be
enemies, (for they did not imagine there were only two of the
Hebrews that came up,) and so they fought one against another;
and some of them died in the battle, and some, as they were
flying away, were thrown down from the rock headlong.
</p><p>3. Now Saul's watchmen told the king that the camp of the
Philistines was in confusion; then he inquired whether any body
was gone away from the army; and when he heard that his son, and
with him his armor-bearer, were absent, he bade the high priest
take the garments of his high priesthood, and prophesy to him
what success they should have; who said that they should get the
victory, and prevail against their enemies. So he went out after
the Philistines, and set upon them as they were slaying&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="158" data-page-number="158" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/172"></span></span>one
another. Those also who had fled to dens and caves, upon hearing
that Saul was gaining a victory, came running to him. When,
therefore, the number of the Hebrews that came to Saul amounted
to about ten thousand, he pursued the enemy, who were scattered
all over the country; but then he fell into an action, which was
a very unhappy one, and liable to be very much blamed; for,
whether out of ignorance or whether out of joy for a victory
gained so strangely, (for it frequently happens that persons so
fortunate are not then able to use their reason consistently,) as
he was desirous to avenge himself, and to exact a due punishment
of the Philistines, he denounced a curse (13) upon the Hebrews:
That if any one put a stop to his slaughter of the enemy, and
fell on eating, and left off the slaughter or the pursuit before
the night came on, and obliged them so to do, he should be
accursed. Now after Saul had denounced this curse, since they
were now in a wood belonging to the tribe of Ephraim, which was
thick and full of bees, Saul's son, who did not hear his father
denounce that curse, nor hear of the approbation the multitude
gave to it, broke off a piece of a honey-comb, and ate part of
it. But, in the mean time, he was informed with what a curse his
father had forbidden them to taste any thing before sun-setting:
so he left off eating, and said his father had not done well in
this prohibition, because, had they taken some food, they had
pursued the enemy with greater rigor and alacrity, and had both
taken and slain many more of their enemies.
</p><p>4. When, therefore, they had slain many ten thousands of the
Philistines, they fell upon spoiling the camp of the Philistines,
but not till late in the evening. They also took a great deal of
prey and cattle, and killed them, and ate them with their blood.
This was told to the king by the scribes, that the multitude were
sinning against God as they sacrificed, and were eating before
the blood was well washed away, and the flesh was made clean.
Then did Saul give order that a great stone should be rolled into
the midst of them, and he made proclamation that they should kill
their sacrifices upon it, and not feed upon the flesh with the
blood, for that was not acceptable to God. And when all the
people did as the king commanded them, Saul erected an altar
there, and offered burnt-offerings upon it to God (14) This was
the first altar that Saul built.
</p><p>5. So when Saul was desirous of leading his men to the enemy's
camp before it was day, in order to plunder it, and when the
soldiers were not unwilling to follow him, but indeed showed
great readiness to do as he commanded them, the king called
Ahitub the high priest, and enjoined him to know of God whether
he would grant them the favor and permission to go against the
enemy's camp, in order to destroy those that were in it. And when
the priest said that God did not give any answer, Saul replied,
"And not without some cause does God refuse to answer what we
inquire of him, while yet a little while ago he declared to us
all that we desired beforehand, and even prevented us in his
answer. To be sure there is some sin against him that is
concealed from us, which is the occasion of his silence. Now I
swear by him himself, that though he that hath committed this sin
should prove to be my own son Jonathan, I will slay him, and by
that means will appease the anger of God against us, and that in
the very same manner as if I were to punish a stranger, and one
not at all related to me, for the same offense." So when the
multitude cried out to him so to do, he presently set all the
rest on one side, and he and his son stood on the other side, and
he sought to discover the offender by lot. Now the lot appeared
to fall upon Jonathan himself. So when he was asked by his father
what sin he had been guilty of, and what he was conscious of in
the course of his life that might be esteemed instances of guilt
or profaneness, his answer was this, "O father, I have done
nothing more than that yesterday, without knowing of the curse
and oath thou hadst denounced, while I was in pursuit of the
enemy, I tasted of a honey-comb." But Saul sware that he would
slay him, and prefer the observation of his oath before all the
ties of birth and of nature. And Jonathan was not dismayed at
this threatening of death, but, offering himself to it generously
and undauntedly, he said, "Nor do I desire you, father, to spare
me: death will be to me very acceptable, when it proceeds from
thy piety, and after a glorious victory; for it is the greatest
consolation to me that I leave the Hebrews victorious over the
Philistines." Hereupon all the people were very sorry, and
greatly afflicted&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="159" data-page-number="159" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/173"></span></span>for Jonathan; and they sware that they would
not overlook Jonathan, and see him die, who was the author of
their victory. By which means they snatched him out of the danger
he was in from his father's curse, while they made their prayers
to God also for the young man, that he would remit his sin.
</p><p>6. So Saul, having slain about sixty thousand of the enemy,
returned home to his own city, and reigned happily: and he also
fought against the neighboring nations, and subdued the
Ammonites, and Moabites, and Philistines, and Edomites, and
Amalekites, as also the king of Zobah. He had three male
children, Jonathan, and Isui, and Melchishua; with Merab and
Michal his daughters. He had also Abner, his uncle's son, for the
captain of his host: that uncle's name was Ner. Now Ner, and Kish
the father of Saul, were brothers. Saul had also a great many
chariots and horsemen, and against whomsoever he made war he
returned conqueror, and advanced the affairs of the Hebrews to a
great degree of success and prosperity, and made them superior to
other nations; and he made such of the young men as were
remarkable for tallness and comeliness the guards of his body.
</p><p>CHAPTER 7.
</p><p>Saul's War With The Amalekites, And Conquest Of Them.
</p><p>1. Now Samuel came unto Saul, and said to him, that he was sent
by God to put him in mind that God had preferred him before all
others, and ordained him king; that he therefore ought to be
obedient to him, and to submit to his authority, as considering,
that though he had the dominion over the other tribes, yet that
God had the dominion over him, and over all things. That
accordingly God said to him, that "because the Amalekites did the
Hebrews a great deal of mischief while they were in the
wilderness, and when, upon their coming out of Egypt, they were
making their way to that country which is now their own, I enjoin
thee to punish the Amalekites, by making war upon them; and when
thou hast subdued them, to leave none of them alive, but to
pursue them through every age, and to slay them, beginning with
the women and the infants, and to require this as a punishment to
be inflicted upon them for the mischief they did to our
forefathers; to spare nothing, neither asses nor other beasts,
nor to reserve any of them for your own advantage and possession,
but to devote them universally to God, and, in obedience to the
commands of Moses, to blot out the name of Amalek entirely." (15)
</p><p>2. So Saul promised to do what he was commanded; and supposing
that his obedience to God would be shown, not only in making war
against the Amalekites, but more fully in the readiness and
quickness of his proceedings, he made no delay, but immediately
gathered together all his forces; and when he had numbered them
in Gilgal, he found them to be about four hundred thousand of the
Israelites, besides the tribe of Judah, for that tribe contained
by itself thirty thousand. Accordingly, Saul made an irruption
into the country of the Amalekites, and set many men in several
parties in ambush at the river, that so he might not only do them
a mischief by open fighting, but might fall upon them
unexpectedly in the ways, and might thereby compass them round
about, and kill them. And when he had joined battle with the
enemy, he beat them; and pursuing them as they fled, he destroyed
them all. And when that undertaking had succeeded, according as
God had foretold, he set upon the cities of the Amalekites; he
besieged them, and took them by force, partly by warlike
machines, partly by mines dug under ground, and partly by
building walls on the outsides. Some they starved out with
famine, and some they gained by other methods; and after all, he
betook himself to slay the women and the children, and thought he
did not act therein either barbarously or inhumanly; first,
because they were enemies whom he thus treated, and, in the next
place, because it was done by the command of God, whom it was
dangerous not to obey. He also took Agag, the enemies' king,
captive, - the beauty and tallness of whose body he admired so
much, that he thought him worthy of preservation. Yet was not
this done however according to the will of God, but by giving way
to human passions, and suffering himself to be moved with an
unseasonable commiseration, in a point where it was not safe for
him to indulge it; for God hated the nation of the Amalekites to
such a degree, that he commanded Saul to have no pity on even
those infants which we by nature chiefly compassionate; but Saul
preserved their king and governor from the miseries which the
Hebrews brought on the people, as if he preferred the fine
appearance of the enemy to the memory of what God had sent him
about. The multitude were also guilty, together with Saul; for
they spared the herds and the flocks, and took them for a prey,
when God had commanded they should not spare them. They also
carried off with them the rest of their wealth and riches; but if
there were any thing&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="160" data-page-number="160" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/174"></span></span>that was not worthy of regard, that they
destroyed.
</p><p>3. But when Saul had conquered all these Amalekites that reached
from Pelusium of Egypt to the Red Sea, he laid waste all the rest
of the enemy's country: but for the nation of the Shechemites, he
did not touch them, although they dwelt in the very middle of the
country of Midian; for before the battle, Saul had sent to them,
and charged them to depart thence, lest they should be partakers
of the miseries of the Amalekites; for he had a just occasion for
saving them, since they were of the kindred of Raguel, Moses's
father-in-law.
</p><p>4. Hereupon Saul returned home with joy, for the glorious things
he had done, and for the conquest of his enemies, as though he
had not neglected any thing which the prophet had enjoined him to
do when he was going to make war with the Amalekites, and as
though he had exactly observed all that he ought to have done.
But God was grieved that the king of the Amalekites was preserved
alive, and that the multitude had seized on the cattle for a
prey, because these things were done without his permission; for
he thought it an intolerable thing that they should conquer and
overcome their enemies by that power which he gave them, and then
that he himself should be so grossly despised and disobeyed by
them, that a mere man that was a king would not bear it. He
therefore told Samuel the prophet, that he repented that he had
made Saul king, while he did nothing that he had commanded him,
but indulged his own inclinations. When Samuel heard that, he was
in confusion, and began to beseech God all that night to be
reconciled to Saul, and not to be angry with him; but he did not
grant that forgiveness to Saul which the prophet asked for, as
not deeming it a fit thing to grant forgiveness of [such] sins at
his entreaties, since injuries do not otherwise grow so great as
by the easy tempers of those that are injured; or while they hunt
after the glory of being thought gentle and good-natured, before
they are aware they produce other sins. As soon therefore as God
had rejected the intercession of the prophet, and it plainly
appeared he would not change his mind, at break of day Samuel
came to Saul at Gilgal. When the king saw him, he ran to him, and
embraced him, and said, "I return thanks to God, who hath given
me the victory, for I have performed every thing that he hath
commanded me." To which Samuel replied, "How is it then that I
hear the bleating of the sheep and the lowing of the greater
cattle in the camp?" Saul made answer, That the people had
reserved them for sacrifices; but that, as to the nation of the
Amalekites, it was entirely destroyed, as he had received it in
command to see done, and that no one man was left; but that he
had saved alive the king alone, and brought him to him,
concerning whom, he said, they would advise together what should
be done with him." But the prophet said, "God is not delighted
with sacrifices, but with good and with righteous men, who are
such as follow his will and his laws, and never think that any
thing is well done by them but when they do it as God had
commanded them; that he then looks upon himself as affronted, not
when any one does not sacrifice, but when any one appears to be
disobedient to him. But that from those who do not obey him, nor
pay him that duty which is the alone true and acceptable worship,
he will not kindly accept their oblations, be those they offer
ever so many and so fat, and be the presents they make him ever
so ornamental, nay, though they were made of gold and silver
themselves, but he will reject them, and esteem them instances of
wickedness, and not of piety. And that he is delighted with those
that still bear in mind this one thing, and this only, how to do
that, whatsoever it be, which God pronounces or commands for them
to do, and to choose rather to die than to transgress any of
those commands; nor does he require so much as a sacrifice from
them. And when these do sacrifice, though it be a mean oblation,
he better accepts of it as the honor of poverty, than such
oblations as come from the richest men that offer them to him.
Wherefore take notice, that thou art under the wrath of God, for
thou hast despised and neglected what he commanded thee. How dost
thou then suppose that he will respect a sacrifice out of such
things as he hath doomed to destruction? unless perhaps thou dost
imagine that it is almost all one to offer it in sacrifice to God
as to destroy it. Do thou therefore expect that thy kingdom will
be taken from thee, and that authority which thou hast abused by
such insolent behavior, as to neglect that God who bestowed it
upon thee." Then did Saul confess that he had acted unjustly, and
did not deny that he had sinned, because he had transgressed the
injunctions of the prophet; but he said that it was out of a
dread and fear of the soldiers, that he did not prohibit and
restrain them when they seized on the prey. "But forgive me,"
said he, "and be merciful to me, for I will be cautious how I
offend for the time to come." He also entreated the prophet to go
back with him, that he might offer his thank-offerings to God;
but Samuel went home, because he saw that God would not be
reconciled to him.
</p><p>5. But then Saul was so desirous to retain Samuel, that he took
hold of his cloak, and because the vehemence of Samuel's
departure made the motion to be violent, the cloak was rent. Upon
which the prophet said, that after the same manner should the
kingdom be rent from him, and that a good and a just man should
take it; that God persevered in what he had decreed about him;
that to be mutable and changeable in what is determined, is
agreeable to human passions only, but is not agreeable to the
Divine Power. Hereupon Saul said that he had been wicked, but
that what was done could not be undone: he therefore desired him
to honor him so far, that the multitud&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="161" data-page-number="161" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/175"></span></span>e might see that he would
accompany him in worshipping God. So Samuel granted him that
favor, and went with him and worshipped God. Agag also, the king
of the Amalekites, was brought to him; and when the king asked,
How bitter death was? Samuel said, "As thou hast made many of the
Hebrew mothers to lament and bewail the loss of their children,
so shalt thou, by thy death, cause thy mother to lament thee
also." Accordingly, he gave order to slay him immediately at
Gilgal, and then went away to the city Ramah.
</p><p>CHAPTER 8.
</p><p>How, Upon Saul's Transgression Of The Prophet's Commands, Samuel
Ordained Another Person To Be King Privately, Whose Name Was
David, As God Commanded Him.
</p><p>1. Now Saul being sensible of the miserable condition he had
brought himself into, and that he had made God to be his enemy,
he went up to his royal palace at Gibeah, which name denotes a
hill, and after that day he came no more into the presence of the
prophet. And when Samuel mourned for him, God bid him leave off
his concern for him, and to take the holy oil, and go to
Bethlehem, to Jesse the son of Obed, and to anoint such of his
sons as he should show him for their future king. But Samuel
said, he was afraid lest Saul, when he came to know of it, should
kill him, either by some private method or even openly. But upon
God's suggesting to him a safe way of going thither, he came to
the forementioned city; and when they all saluted him, and asked
what was the occasion of his coming, he told them he came to
sacrifice to God. When, therefore, he had gotten the sacrifice
ready, he called Jesse and his sons to partake of those
sacrifices; and when he saw his eldest son to be a tall and
handsome man, he guessed by his comeliness that he was the person
who was to be their future king. But he was mistaken in judging
about God's providence; for when Samuel inquired of God whether
he should anoint this youth, whom he so admired, and esteemed
worthy of the kingdom, God said, "Men do not see as God seeth.
Thou indeed hast respect to the fine appearance of this youth,
and thence esteemest him worthy of the kingdom, while I propose
the kingdom as a reward, not of the beauty of bodies, but of the
virtue of souls, and I inquire after one that is perfectly comely
in that respect; I mean one who is beautiful in piety, and
righteousness, and fortitude, and obedience, for in them consists
the comeliness of the soul." When God had said this, Samuel bade
Jesse to show him all his sons. So he made five others of his
sons to come to him; of all of whom Eliab was the eldest,
Aminadab the second, Shammall the third, Nathaniel the fourth,
Rael the fifth, and Asam the sixth. And when the prophet saw that
these were no way inferior to the eldest in their countenances,
he inquired of God which of them it was whom he chose for their
king. And when God said it was none of them, he asked Jesse
whether he had not some other sons besides these; and when he
said that he had one more, named David, but that he was a
shepherd, and took care of the flocks, Samuel bade them call him
immediately, for that till he was come they could not possibly
sit down to the feast. Now, as soon as his father had sent for
David, and he was come, he appeared to be of a yellow complexion,
of a sharp sight, and a comely person in other respects also.
This is he, said Samuel privately to himself, whom it pleases God
to make our king. So he sat down to the feast, and placed the
youth under him, and Jesse also, with his other sons; after which
he took oil in the presence of David, and anointed him, and
whispered him in the ear, and acquainted him that God chose him
to be their king; and exhorted him to be righteous, and obedient
to his commands, for that by this means his kingdom would
continue for a long time, and that his house should be of great
splendor, and celebrated in the world; that he should overthrow
the Philistines; and that against what nations soever he should
make war, he should be the conqueror, and survive the fight; and
that while he lived he should enjoy a glorious name, and leave
such a name to his posterity also.
</p><p>2. So Samuel, when he had given him these admonitions, went away.
But the Divine Power departed from Saul, and removed to David;
who, upon this removal of the Divine Spirit to him, began to
prophesy. But as for Saul, some strange and demoniacal disorders
came upon him, and brought upon him such suffocations as were
ready to choke him; for which the physicians could find no other
remedy but this, That if any person could charm those passions by
singing, and playing upon the harp, they advised them to inquire
for such a one, and to observe when these demons came upon him
and disturbed him, and to take care that such a person might
stand over him, and play upon the harp, and recite hymns to him.
(16) Accordingly Saul did not delay, but commanded them to seek
out such a man. And when a certain stander-by said that he had
seen in the city of Bethlehem a son of Jesse, who was yet no more
than a child in age, but comely and beautiful, and in other
respects one that was deserving of great regard, who was skillful
in playing on the harp, and in singing of hymns, [and an
excellent soldier in war,] he sent to Jesse, and desired him to
take David away from the flocks, and send him to him, for he had
a mind to see him, as having&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="162" data-page-number="162" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/176"></span></span>heard an advantageous character of
his comeliness and his valor. So Jesse sent his son, and gave him
presents to carry to Saul. And when he was come, Saul was pleased
with him, and made him his armor-bearer, and had him in very
great esteem; for he charmed his passion, and was the only
physician against the trouble he had from the demons, whensoever
it was that it came upon him, and this by reciting of hymns, and
playing upon the harp, and bringing Saul to his right mind again.
However, he sent to Jesse, the father of the child, and desired
him to permit David to stay with him, for that he was delighted
with his sight and company; which stay, that he might not
contradict Saul, he granted.
</p><p>CHAPTER 9.
</p><p>How The Philistines Made Another Expedition Against The Hebrews
Under The Reign Of Saul; And How They Were Overcome By David's
Slaying Goliath In Single Combat.
</p><p>1. Now the Philistines gathered themselves together again no very
long time afterward; and having gotten together a great army,
they made war against the Israelites; and having seized a place
between Shochoh and Azekah, they there pitched their camp. Saul
also drew out his army to oppose them; and by pitching his own
camp on a certain hill, he forced the Philistines to leave their
former camp, and to encamp themselves upon such another hill,
over-against that on which Saul's army lay, so that a valley,
which was between the two hills on which they lay, divided their
camps asunder. Now there came down a man out of the camp of the
Philistines, whose name was Goliath, of the city of Gath, a man
of vast bulk, for he was of four cubits and a span in tallness,
and had about him weapons suitable to the largeness of his body,
for he had a breastplate on that weighed five thousand shekels:
he had also a helmet and greaves of brass, as large as you would
naturally suppose might cover the limbs of so vast a body. His
spear was also such as was not carried like a light thing in his
right hand, but he carried it as lying on his shoulders. He had
also a lance of six hundred shekels; and many followed him to
carry his armor. Wherefore this Goliath stood between the two
armies, as they were in battle array, and sent out aloud voice,
and said to Saul and the Hebrews, "I will free you from fighting
and from dangers; for what necessity is there that your army
should fall and be afflicted? Give me a man of you that will
fight with me, and he that conquers shall have the reward of the
conqueror and determine the war; for these shall serve those
others to whom the conqueror shall belong; and certainly it is
much better, and more prudent, to gain what you desire by the
hazard of one man than of all." When he had said this, he retired
to his own camp; but the next day he came again, and used the
same words, and did not leave off for forty days together, to
challenge the enemy in the same words, till Saul and his army
were therewith terrified, while they put themselves in array as
if they would fight, but did not come to a close battle.
</p><p>2. Now while this war between the Hebrews and the Philistines was
going on, Saul sent away David to his father Jesse, and contented
himself with those three sons of his whom he had sent to his
assistance, and to be partners in the dangers of the war: and at
first David returned to feed his sheep and his flocks; but after
no long time he came to the camp of the Hebrews, as sent by his
father, to carry provisions to his brethren, and to know what
they were doing. While Goliath came again, and challenged them,
and reproached them, that they had no man of valor among them
that durst come down to fight him; and as David was talking with
his brethren about the business for which his father had sent
him, he heard the Philistine reproaching and abusing the army,
and had indignation at it, and said to his brethren, "I am ready
to fight a single combat with this adversary." Whereupon Eliab,
his eldest brother, reproved him, and said that he spoke too
rashly and improperly for one of his age, and bid him go to his
flocks, and to his father. So he was abashed at his brother's
words, and went away, but still he spake to some of the soldiers
that he was willing to fight with him that challenged them. And
when they had informed Saul what was the resolution of the young
man, the king sent for him to come to him: and when the king
asked what he had to say, he replied, "O king, be not cast down,
nor afraid, for I will depress the insolence of this adversary,
and will go down and fight with him, and will bring him under me,
as tall and as great as he is, till he shall be sufficiently
laughed at, and thy army shall get great glory, when he shall be
slain by one that is not yet of man's estate, neither fit for
fighting, nor capable of being intrusted with the marshalling an
army, or ordering a battle, but by one that looks like a child,
and is really no elder in age than a child."
</p><p>3. Now Saul wondered at the boldness and alacrity of David, but
durst not presume on his ability, by reason of his age; but said
he must on that account be too weak to fight with one that was
skilled in the art of war. "I undertake this enterprise," said
David, "in dependence on God's being with me, for I have had
experience already of his assistance; for I once pursued after
and caught a lion that assaulted my flocks, and took away a lamb
from them; and I snatched the lamb out of the wild beast's mouth,
and when he leaped upon me with violence, I took him by the tail,
and dashed him against the ground. In the same manner did I
avenge myself on a bear also; and let this adversary of ours be
esteemed like one of these wild beasts, since he has a long while
reproached our army, and blasphemed our God, who yet will reduce
him under my power."&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="163" data-page-number="163" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/177"></span></span>
</p><p>4. However, Saul prayed that the end might be, by God's
assistance, not disagreeable to the alacrity and boldness of the
child; and said, "Go thy way to the fight." So he put about him
his breastplate, and girded on his sword, and fitted the helmet
to his head, and sent him away. But David was burdened with his
armor, for he had not been exercised to it, nor had he learned to
walk with it; so he said, "Let this armor be thine, O king, who
art able to bear it; but give me leave to fight as thy servant,
and as I myself desire." Accordingly he laid by the armor, and
taking his staff with him, and putting five stones out of the
brook into a shepherd's bag, and having a sling in his right
hand, he went towards Goliath. But the adversary seeing him come
in such a manner, disdained him, and jested upon him, as if he
had not such weapons with him as are usual when one man fights
against another, but such as are used in driving away and
avoiding of dogs; and said, "Dost thou take me not for a man, but
a dog?" To which he replied, "No, not for a dog, but for a
creature worse than a dog." This provoked Goliath to anger, who
thereupon cursed him by the name of God, and threatened to give
his flesh to the beasts of the earth, and to the fowls of the
air, to be torn in pieces by them. To whom David answered, Thou
comest to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a
breastplate; but I have God for my armor in coming against thee,
who will destroy thee and all thy army by my hands for I will
this day cut off thy head, and cast the other parts of thy body
to the dogs, and all men shall learn that God is the protector of
the Hebrews, and that our armor and our strength is in his
providence; and that without God's assistance, all other warlike
preparations and power are useless." So the Philistine being
retarded by the weight of his armor, when he attempted to meet
David in haste, came on but slowly, as despising him, and
depending upon it that he should slay him, who was both unarmed
and a child also, without any trouble at all.
</p><p>5. But the youth met his antagonist, being accompanied with an
invisible assistant, who was no other than God himself. And
taking one of the stones that he had out of the brook, and had
put into his shepherd's bag, and fitting it to his sling, he
slang it against the Philistine. This stone fell upon his
forehead, and sank into his brain, insomuch that Goliath was
stunned, and fell upon his face. So David ran, and stood upon his
adversary as he lay down, and cut off his head with his own
sword; for he had no sword himself. And upon the fall of Goliath
the Philistines were beaten, and fled; for when they saw their
champion prostrate on the ground, they were afraid of the entire
issue of their affairs, and resolved not to stay any longer, but
committed themselves to an ignominious and indecent flight, and
thereby endeavored to save themselves from the dangers they were
in. But Saul and the entire army of the Hebrews made a shout, and
rushed upon them, and slew a great number of them, and pursued
the rest to the borders of Garb, and to the gates of Ekron; so
that there were slain of the Philistines thirty thousand, and
twice as many wounded. But Saul returned to their camp, and
pulled their fortification to pieces, and burnt it; but David
carried the head of Goliath into his own tent, but dedicated his
sword to God [at the tabernacle].
</p><p>CHAPTER 10.
</p><p>Saul Envies David For His Glorious Success, And Takes An Occasion
Of Entrapping Him, From The Promise He Made Him Of Giving Him His
Daughter In Marriage; But This Upon Condition Of His Bringing Him
Six Hundred Heads Of The Philistines.
</p><p>1. Now the women were an occasion of Saul's envy and hatred to
David; for they came to meet their victorious army with cymbals,
and drums, and all demonstrations of joy, and sang thus: The
wives said, that "Saul had slain his many thousands of the
Philistines." The virgins replied, that "David had slain his ten
thousands." Now, when the king heard them singing thus, and that
he had himself the smallest share in their commendations, and the
greater number, the ten thousands, were ascribed to the young
man; and when he considered with himself that there was nothing
more wanting to David, after such a mighty applause, but the
kingdom; he began to be afraid and suspicious of David.
Accordingly he removed him from the station he was in before, for
he was his armor-bearer, which, out of fear, seemed to him much
too near a station for him; and so he made him captain over a
thousand, and bestowed on him a post better indeed in itself,
but, as he thought, more for his own security; for he had a mind
to send him against the enemy, and into battles, as hoping he
would be slain in such dangerous conflicts.
</p><p>2. But David had God going along with him whithersoever he went,
and accordingly he greatly prospered in his undertakings, and it
was visible that he had mighty success, insomuch that Saul's
daughter, who was still a virgin, fell in love with him; and her
affection so far prevailed over her, that it could not be
concealed, and her father became acquainted with it. Now Saul
heard this gladly, as intending to make use of it for a snare
against David, and he hoped that it would prove the cause of
destruction and of hazard to him; so he told those that informed
him of his daughter's affection, that he would willingly give
David the virgin in marriage, and said, "I engage myself to marry
my daughter to him if he will bring me six hundred heads of my
enemies (17) supposing that when a reward so&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="164" data-page-number="164" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/178"></span></span>ample was proposed
to him, and when he should aim to get him great glory, by
undertaking a thing so dangerous and incredible, he would
immediately set about it, and so perish by the Philistines; and
my designs about him will succeed finely to my mind, for I shall
be freed from him, and get him slain, not by myself, but by
another man." So he gave order to his servants to try how David
would relish this proposal of marrying the damsel. Accordingly,
they began to speak thus to him: That king Saul loved him, as
well as did all the people, and that he was desirous of his
affinity by the marriage of this damsel. To which he gave this
answer: - "Seemeth it to you a light thing to be made the king's
son-in-law? It does not seem so to me, especially when I am one
of a family that is low, and without any glory or honor." Now
when Saul was informed by his servants what answer David had
made, he said, - "Tell him that I do not want any money nor dowry
from him, which would be rather to set my daughter to sale than
to give her in marriage; but I desire only such a son-in-law as
hath in him fortitude, and all other kinds of virtue," of which
he saw David was possessed, and that his desire was to receive of
him, on account of his marrying his daughter, neither gold nor
silver, nor that he should bring such wealth out of his father's
house, but only some revenge on the Philistines, and indeed six
hundred of their heads, than which a more desirable or a more
glorious present could not be brought him, and that he had much
rather obtain this, than any of the accustomed dowries for his
daughter, viz. that she should be married to a man of that
character, and to one who had a testimony as having conquered his
enemies.
</p><p>3. When these words of Saul were brought to David, he was pleased
with them, and supposed that Saul was really desirous of this
affinity with him; so that without bearing to deliberate any
longer, or casting about in his mind whether what was proposed
was possible, or was difficult or not, he and his companions
immediately set upon the enemy, and went about doing what was
proposed as the condition of the marriage. Accordingly, because
it was God who made all things easy and possible to David, he
slew many [of the Philistines], and cut off the heads of six
hundred of them, and came to the king, and by showing him these
heads of the Philistines, required that he might have his
daughter in marriage. Accordingly, Saul having no way of getting
off his engagements, as thinking it a base thing either to seem a
liar when he promised him this marriage, or to appear to have
acted treacherously by him, in putting him upon what was in a
manner impossible, in order to have him slain, he gave him his
daughter in marriage: her name was Michal.
</p><p>CHAPTER 11.
</p><p>How David, Upon Saul's Laying Snares For Him, Did Yet Escape The
Dangers He Was In By The Affection And Care Of Jonathan And The
Contrivances Of His Wife Michal: And How He Came To Samuel The
Prophet.
</p><p>1. However, Saul was not disposed to persevere long in the state
wherein he was, for when he saw that David was in great esteem,
both with God and with the multitude, he was afraid; and being
not able to conceal his fear as concerning great things, his
kingdom and his life, to be deprived of either of which was a
very great calamity, he resolved to have David slain, and
commanded his son Jonathan and his most faithful servants to kill
him: but Jonathan wondered at his father's change with relation
to David, that it should be made to so great a degree, from
showing him no small good-will, to contrive how to have him
killed. Now, because he loved the young man, and reverenced him
for his virtue, he informed him of the secret charge his father
had given, and what his intentions were concerning him. However,
he advised him to take care and be absent the next day, for that
he would salute his father, and, if he met with a favorable
opportunity, he would discourse with him about him, and learn the
cause of his disgust, and show how little ground there was for
it, and that for it he ought not to kill a man that had done so
many good things to the multitude, and had been a benefactor to
himself, on account of which he ought in reason to obtain pardon,
had he been guilty of the greatest crimes; and "I will then
inform thee of my father's resolution." Accordingly David
complied with such an advantageous advice, and kept himself then
out of the king's sight.
</p><p>2. On the next day Jonathan came to Saul, as soon as he saw him
in a cheerful and joyful disposition, and began to introduce a
discourse about David: "What unjust action, O father, either
little or great, hast thou found so exceptionable in David, as to
induce thee to order us to slay a man who hath been of great
advantage to thy own preservation, and of still greater to the
punishment of the Philistines? A man who hath delivered the
people of the Hebrews from reproach and derision, which they
underwent for forty days together, when he alone had courage
enough to sustain the challen&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="165" data-page-number="165" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/179"></span></span>ge of the adversary, and after that
brought as many heads of our enemies as he was appointed to
bring, and had, as a reward for the same, my sister in marriage;
insomuch that his death would be very sorrowful to us, not only
on account of his virtue, but on account of the nearness of our
relation; for thy daughter must be injured at the same time that
he is slain, and must be obliged to experience widowhood, before
she can come to enjoy any advantage from their mutual
conversation. Consider these things, and change your mind to a
more merciful temper, and do no mischief to a man, who, in the
first place, hath done us the greatest kindness of preserving
thee; for when an evil spirit and demons had seized upon thee, he
cast them out, and procured rest to thy soul from their
incursions: and, in the second place, hath avenged us of our
enemies; for it is a base thing to forget such benefits." So Saul
was pacified with these words, and sware to his son that he would
do David no harm, for a righteous discourse proved too hard for
the king's anger and fear. So Jonathan sent for David, and
brought him good news from his father, that he was to be
preserved. He also brought him to his father; and David continued
with the king as formerly.
</p><p>3. About this time it was that, upon the Philistines making a new
expedition against the Hebrews, Saul sent David with an army to
fight with them; and joining battle with them he slew many of
them, and after his victory he returned to the king. But his
reception by Saul was not as he expected upon such success, for
he was grieved at his prosperity, because he thought he would be
more dangerous to him by having acted so gloriously: but when the
demoniacal spirit came upon him, and put him into disorder, and
disturbed him, he called for David into his bed-chamber wherein
he lay, and having a spear in his hand, he ordered him to charm
him with playing on his harp, and with singing hymns; which when
David did at his command, he with great force threw the spear at
him; but David was aware of it before it came, and avoided it,
and fled to his own house, and abode there all that day.
</p><p>4. But at night the king sent officers, and commanded that he
should be watched till the morning, lest he should get quite
away, that he might come into the judgment-hall, and so might be
delivered up, and condemned and slain. But when Michal, David's
wife, the king's daughter, understood what her father designed,
she came to her husband, as having small hopes of his
deliverance, and as greatly concerned about her own life also,
for she could not bear to live in case she were deprived of him;
and she said, "Let not the sun find thee here when it rises, for
if it do, that will be the last time it will see thee: fly away
then while the night may afford thee opportunity, and may God
lengthen it for thy sake; for know this, that if my father find
thee, thou art a dead man." So she let him down by a cord out of
the window, and saved him: and after she had done so, she fitted
up a bed for him as if he were sick, and put under the
bed-clothes a goat's liver (18) and when her father, as soon as
it was day, sent to seize David, she said to those that were
there, That he had not been well that night, and showed them the
bed covered, and made them believe, by the leaping of the liver,
which caused the bed-clothes to move also, that David breathed
like one that was asthmatic. So when those that were sent told
Saul that David had not been well in the night he ordered him to
be brought in that condition, for he intended to kill him. Now
when they came and uncovered the bed, and found out the woman's
contrivance, they told it to the king; and when her father
complained of her that she had saved his enemy, and had put a
trick upon himself, she invented this plausible defense for
herself, and said, That when he had threatened to kill her, she
lent him her assistance for his preservation, out of fear; for
which her assistance she ought to be forgiven, because it was not
done of her own free choice, but out of necessity: "For," said
she, "I do not suppose that thou wast so zealous to kill thy
enemy, as thou wast that I should be saved." Accordingly Saul
forgave the damsel; but David, when he had escaped this danger,
came to the prophet Samuel to Ramah, and told him what snares the
king had laid for him, and how he was very near to death by
Saul's throwing a spear at him, although he had been no way
guilty with relation to him, nor had he been cowardly in his
battles with his enemies, but had succeeded well in them all, by
God's assistance; which thing was indeed the cause of Saul's
hatred to David.
</p><p>5. When the prophet was made acquainted with the unjust
proceedings of the king, he left the city Ramah, and took David
with him, to a certain place called Naioth, and there he abode
with him. But when it was told Saul that David was with the
prophet, he sent soldiers to him, and ordered them to take him,
and bring him to him: and when they came to Samuel, and found
there a congregation of prophets, they became partakers of the
Divine Spirit, and began to prophesy; which when Saul heard of,
he sent others to David, who prophesying in like manner as did
the first, he again sent others; which third sort prophesying
also, at last he was angry, and went thither in great haste
himself; and when he was just by the place, Samuel, before he saw
him, made him prophesy also. And when Saul&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="166" data-page-number="166" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/180"></span></span>came to him, he was
disordered in mind (19) and under the vehement agitation of a
spirit; and, putting off his garments, (20) he fell down, and lay
on the ground all that day and night, in the presence of Samuel
and David.
</p><p>6. And David went thence, and came to Jonathan, the son of Saul,
and lamented to him what snares were laid for him by his father;
and said, that though he had been guilty of no evil, nor had
offended against him, yet he was very zealous to get him killed.
Hereupon Jonathan exhorted him not to give credit to such his own
suspicions, nor to the calumnies of those that raised those
reports, if there were any that did so, but to depend on him, and
take courage; for that his father had no such intention, since he
would have acquainted him with that matter, and have taken his
advice, had it been so, as he used to consult with him in common
when he acted in other affairs. But David sware to him that so it
was; and he desired him rather to believe him, and to provide for
his safety, than to despise what he, with great sincerity, told
him: that he would believe what he said, when he should either
see him killed himself, or learn it upon inquiry from others: and
that the reason why his father did not tell him of these things,
was this, that he knew of the friendship and affection that he
bore towards him.
</p><p>7. Hereupon, when Jonathan found that this intention of Saul was
so well attested, he asked him what he would have him do for him.
To which David replied, "I am sensible that thou art willing to
gratify me in every thing, and procure me what I desire. Now
tomorrow is the new moon, and I was accustomed to sit down then
with the king at supper: now, if it seem good to thee, I will go
out of the city, and conceal myself privately there; and if Saul
inquire why I am absent, tell him that I am gone to my own city
Bethlehem, to keep a festival with my own tribe; and add this
also, that thou gavest me leave so to do. And if he say, as is
usually said in the case of friends that are gone abroad, It is
well that he went, then assure thyself that no latent mischief or
enmity may be feared at his hand; but if he answer otherwise,
that will be a sure sign that he hath some designs against me,
Accordingly thou shalt inform me of thy father's inclinations;
and that out of pity to my case and out of thy friendship for me,
as instances of which friendship thou hast vouchsafed to accept
of the assurances of my love to thee, and to give the like
assurances to me, that is, those of a master to his servant; but
if thou discoverest any wickedness in me, do thou prevent thy
father, and kill me thyself."
</p><p>8. But Jonathan heard these last words with indignation, and
promised to do what he desired of him, and to inform him if his
father's answers implied any thing of a melancholy nature, and
any enmity against him. And that he might the more firmly depend
upon him, he took him out into the open field, into the pure air,
and sware that he would neglect nothing that might tend to the
preservation of David; and he said, "I appeal to that God, who,
as thou seest, is diffused every where, and knoweth this
intention of mine, before I explain it in words, as the witness
of this my covenant with thee, that I will not leave off to make
frequent trims of the purpose of my father till I learn whether
there be any lurking distemper in the most secret parts of his
soul; and when I have learnt it, I will not conceal it from thee,
but will discover it to thee, whether he be gently or peevishly
disposed; for this God himself knows, that I pray he may always
be with thee, for he is with thee now, and will not forsake thee,
and will make thee superior to thine enemies, whether my father
be one of them, or whether I myself be such. Do thou only
remember what we now do; and if it fall out that I die, preserve
my children alive, and requite what kindness thou hast now
received to them." When he had thus sworn, he dismissed David,
bidding him go to a certain place of that plain wherein he used
to perform his exercises; for that, as soon as he knew the mind
of his father, he would come thither to him, with one servant
only; "and if," says he, "I shoot three darts at the mark, and
then bid my servant to carry these three darts away, for they are
before him, know thou that there is no mischief to be feared from
my father; but if thou hearest me say the contrary, expect the
contrary from the king. However, thou shalt gain security by my
means, and shalt by no means suffer any harm; but see thou dost
not forget what I have desired of thee in the time of thy
prosperity, and be serviceable to my&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="167" data-page-number="167" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/181"></span></span>children." Now David, when
he had received these assurances from Jonathan, went his way to
the place appointed.
</p><p>9. But on the next day, which was the new moon, the king, when he
had purified himself, as the custom was, came to supper; and when
there sat by him his son Jonathan on his right hand, and Abner,
the captain of his host, on the other hand, he saw David's seat
was empty, but said nothing, supposing that he had not purified
himself since he had accompanied with his wife, and so could not
be present; but when he saw that he was not there the second day
of the month neither, he inquired of his son Jonathan why the son
of Jesse did not come to the supper and the feast, neither the
day before nor that day. So Jonathan said, That he was gone,
according to the agreement between them, to his own city, where
his tribe kept a festival, and that by his permission: that he
also invited him to come to their sacrifice; "and," says
Jonathan, "if thou wilt give me leave, I Will go thither, for
thou knowest the good-will that I bear him." And then it was that
Jonathan understood his father's hatred to David, and plainly saw
his entire disposition; for Saul could not restrain his anger,
but reproached Jonathan, and called him the son of a runagate,
and an enemy; and said he was a partner with David, and his
assistant, and that by his behavior he showed he had no regard to
himself, or to his mother, and would not be persuaded of this, -
that while David is alive, their kingdom was not secure to them;
yet did he bid him send for him, that he might be punished. And
when Jonathan said, in answer, "What hath he done that thou wilt
punish him?" Saul no longer contented himself to express his
anger in bare words, but snatched up his spear, and leaped upon
him, and was desirous to kill him. He did not indeed do what he
intended, because he was hindered by his friends; but it appeared
plainly to his son that he hated David, and greatly desired to
despatch him, insomuch that he had almost slain his son with his
own hands on his account.
</p><p>10. And then it was that the king's son rose hastily from supper;
and being unable to admit any thing into his mouth for grief, he
wept all night, both because he had himself been near
destruction, and because the death of David was determined: but
as soon as it was day, he went out into the plain that was before
the city, as going to perform his exercises, but in reality to
inform his friend what disposition his father was in towards him,
as he had agreed with him to do; and when Jonathan had done what
had been thus agreed, he dismissed his servant that followed him,
to return to the city; but he himself went into the desert, and
came into his presence, and communed with him. So David appeared
and fell at Jonathan's feet, and bowed down to him, and called
him the preserver of his soul; but he lifted him up from the
earth, and they mutually embraced one another, and made a long
greeting, and that not without tears. They also lamented their
age, and that familiarity which envy would deprive them of, and
that separation which must now be expected, which seemed to them
no better than death itself. So recollecting themselves at length
from their lamentation, and exhorting one another to be mindful
of the oaths they had sworn to each other, they parted asunder.
</p><p>CHAPTER 12.
</p><p>How David Fled To Ahimelech And Afterwards To The Kings Of The
Philistines And Of The Moabites, And How Saul Slew Ahimelech And
His Family.
</p><p>1. But David fled from the king, and that death he was in danger
of by him, and came to the city Nob, to Ahimelech the priest,
who, when he saw him coming all alone, and neither a friend nor a
servant with him, he wondered at it, and desired to learn of him
the cause why there was nobody with him. To which David answered,
That the king had commanded him to do a certain thing that was to
be kept secret, to which, if he had a mind to know so much, he
had no occasion for any one to accompany him; "however, I have
ordered my servants to meet me at such and such a place." So he
desired him to let him have somewhat to eat; and that in case he
would supply him, he would act the part of a friend, and be
assisting to the business he was now about: and when he had
obtained what he desired, he also asked him whether he had any
weapons with him, either sword or spear. Now there was at Nob a
servant of Saul, by birth a Syrian, whose name was Doeg, one that
kept the king's mules. The high priest said that he had no such
weapons; but, he added, "Here is the sword of Goliath, which,
when thou hadst slain the Philistine, thou didst dedicate to
God."
</p><p>2. When David had received the sword, he fled out of the country
of the Hebrews into that of the Philistines, over which Achish
reigned; and when the king's servants knew him, and he was made
known to the king himself, the servants informing him that he was
that David who had killed many ten thousands of the Philistines,
David was afraid lest the king should put him to death, and that
he should experience that danger from him which he had escaped
from Saul; so he pretended to be distracted and mad, so that his
spittle ran out of his mouth; and he did other the like actions
before the king of Gath, which might make him believe that they
proceeded from such a distemper. Accordingly the king was very
angry at his servants that they had brought him a madman, and he
gave orders that they should eject David immediately [out of the
city].
</p><p>3. So when David had escaped in this manner out of Gath, he came
to the tribe of Judah, and abode in a cave by the city of
Adullam. Then it was that he sent to his brethren, and informed
them where he was, who then came to him with all their kindred,
and as many others as were&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="168" data-page-number="168" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/182"></span></span>either in want or in fear of king
Saul, came and made a body together, and told him they were ready
to obey his orders; they were in all about four hundred.
Whereupon he took courage, now such a force and assistance was
come to him; so he removed thence and came to the king of the
Moabites, and desired him to entertain his parents in his
country, while the issue of his affairs were in such an uncertain
condition. The king granted him this favor, and paid great
respect to David's parents all the time they were with him.
</p><p>4. As for himself, upon the prophet's commanding him to leave the
desert, and to go into the portion of the tribe of Judah, and
abide there, he complied therewith; and coming to the city
Hareth, which was in that tribe, he remained there. Now when Saul
heard that David had been seen with a multitude about him, he
fell into no small disturbance and trouble; but as he knew that
David was a bold and courageous man, he suspected that somewhat
extraordinary would appear from him, and that openly also, which
would make him weep and put him into distress; so he called
together to him his friends, and his commanders, and the tribe
from which he was himself derived, to the hill where his palace
was; and sitting upon a place called Aroura, his courtiers that
were in dignities, and the guards of his body, being with him, he
spake thus to them: - "You that are men of my own tribe, I
conclude that you remember the benefits that I have bestowed upon
you, and that I have made some of you owners of land, and made
you commanders, and bestowed posts of honor upon you, and set
some of you over the common people, and others over the soldiers;
I ask you, therefore, whether you expect greater and more
donations from the son of Jesse? for I know that you are all
inclinable to him; (even my own son Jonathan himself is of that
opinion, and persuades you to be of the same); for I am not
unacquainted with the oaths and the covenants that are between
him and David, and that Jonathan is a counselor and an assistant
to those that conspire against me, and none of you are concerned
about these things, but you keep silence and watch, to see what
will be the upshot of these things." When the king had made this
speech, not one of the rest of those that were present made any
answer; but Doeg the Syrian, who fed his mules, said, that he saw
David when he came to the city Nob to Ahimelech the high priest,
and that he learned future events by his prophesying; that he
received food from him, and the sword of Goliath, and was
conducted by him with security to such as he desired to go to.
</p><p>5. Saul therefore sent for the high priest, and for all his
kindred; and said to them, "What terrible or ungrateful tiring
hast thou suffered from me, that thou hast received the son of
Jesse, and hast bestowed on him both food and weapons, when he
was contriving to get the kingdom? And further, why didst thou
deliver oracles to him concerning futurities? For thou couldst
not be unacquainted that he was fled away from me, and that he
hated my family." But the high priest did not betake himself to
deny what he had done, but confessed boldly that he had supplied
him with these things, not to gratify David, but Saul himself:
and he said, "I did not know that he was thy adversary, but a
servant of thine, who was very faithful to thee, and a captain
over a thousand of thy soldiers, and, what is more than these,
thy son-in-law, and kinsman. Men do not choose to confer such
favors on their adversaries, but on those who are esteemed to
bear the highest good-will and respect to them. Nor is this the
first time that I prophesied for him, but I have done it often,
and at other times as well as now. And when he told me that he
was sent by thee in great haste to do somewhat, if I had
furnished him with nothing that he desired I should have thought
that it was rather in contradiction to thee than to him;
wherefore do not thou entertain any ill opinion of me, nor do
thou have a suspicion of what I then thought an act of humanity,
from what is now told thee of David's attempts against thee, for
I did then to him as to thy friend and son-in-law, and captain of
a thousand, and not as to thine adversary."
</p><p>6. When the high priest had spoken thus, he did not persuade
Saul, his fear was so prevalent, that he could not give credit to
an apology that was very just. So he commanded his armed men that
stood about him to kill him, and all his kindred; but as they
durst not touch the high priest, but were more afraid of
disobeying God than the king, he ordered Doeg the Syrian to kill
them. Accordingly, he took to his assistance such wicked men as
were like himself, and slew Ahimelech and all his family, who
were in all three hundred and eighty-five. Saul also sent to Nob,
(21) the city of the priests, and slew all that were there,
without sparing either women or children, or any other age, and
burnt it; only there was one son of Ahimelech, whose name was&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="169" data-page-number="169" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/183"></span></span>Abiathar, who escaped. However, these things came to pass as God
had foretold to Eli the high priest, when he said that his
posterity should be destroyed, on account of the transgression of
his two sons.
</p><p>7. (22) Now this king Saul, by perpetrating so barbarous a crime,
and murdering the whole family of the high-priestly dignity, by
having no pity of the infants, nor reverence for the aged, and by
overthrowing the city which God had chosen for the property, and
for the support of the priests and prophets which were there, and
had ordained as the only city allotted for the education of such
men, gives all to understand and consider the disposition of men,
that while they are private persons, and in a low condition,
because it is not in their power to indulge nature, nor to
venture upon what they wish for, they are equitable and moderate,
and pursue nothing but what is just, and bend their whole minds
and labors that way; then it is that they have this belief about
God, that he is present to all the actions of their lives, and
that he does not only see the actions that are done, but clearly
knows those their thoughts also, whence those actions do arise.
But when once they are advanced into power and authority, then
they put off all such notions, and, as if they were no other than
actors upon a theater, they lay aside their disguised parts and
manners, and take up boldness, insolence, and a contempt of both
human and Divine laws, and this at a time when they especially
stand in need of piety and righteousness, because they are then
most of all exposed to envy, and all they think, and all they
say, are in the view of all men; then it is that they become so
insolent in their actions, as though God saw them no longer, or
were afraid of them because of their power: and whatsoever it is
that they either are afraid of by the rumors they hear, or they
hate by inclination, or they love without reason, these seem to
them to be authentic, and firm, and true, and pleasing both to
men and to God; but as to what will come hereafter, they have not
the least regard to it. They raise those to honor indeed who have
been at a great deal of pains for them, and after that honor they
envy them; and when they have brought them into high dignity,
they do not only deprive them of what they had obtained, but
also, on that very account, of their lives also, and that on
wicked accusations, and such as on account of their extravagant
nature, are incredible. They also punish men for their actions,
not such as deserve condemnation, but from calumnies and
accusations without examination; and this extends not only to
such as deserve to be punished, but to as many as they are able
to kill. This reflection is openly confirmed to us from the
example of Saul, the son of Kish, who was the first king who
reigned after our aristocracy and government under the judges
were over; and that by his slaughter of three hundred priests and
prophets, on occasion of his suspicion about Ahimelech, and by
the additional wickedness of the overthrow of their city, and
this is as he were endeavoring in some sort to render the temple
[tabernacle] destitute both of priests and prophets, which
endeavor he showed by slaying so many of them, and not suffering
the very city belonging to them to remain, that so others might
succeed them.
</p><p>8. But Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, who alone could be saved
out of the family of priests slain by Saul, fled to David, and
informed him of the calamity that had befallen their family, and
of the slaughter of his father; who hereupon said, He was not
unapprised of what would follow with relation to them when he saw
Doeg there; for he had then a suspicion that the high priest
would be falsely accused by him to the king, and he blamed
himself as having been the cause of this misfortune. But he
desired him to stay there, and abide with him, as in a place
where he might be better concealed than any where else.
</p><p>CHAPTER 13.
</p><p>How David, When He Had Twice The Opportunity Of Killing Saul Did
Not Kill Him. Also Concerning The Death Of Samuel And Nabal.
</p><p>1. About this time it was that David heard how the Philistines
had made an inroad into the country of Keilah, and robbed it; so
he offered himself to fight against them, if God, when he should
be consulted by the prophet, would grant him the victory. And
when the prophet said that God gave a signal of victory, he made
a sudden onset upon the Philistines with his companions, and he
shed a great deal of their blood, and carried off their prey, and
staid with the inhabitants of Keilah till they had securely
gathered in their corn and their fruits. However, it was told
Saul the king that David was with the men of Keilah; for what had
been done and the great success that had attended him, were not
confined among the people where the things were done, but the
fame of it went all abroad, and came to the hearing of others,
and both the fact as it stood, and the&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="170" data-page-number="170" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/184"></span></span>author of the fact, were
carried to the king's ears. Then was Saul glad when he heard
David was in Keilah; and he said, "God hath now put him into my
hands, since he hath obliged him to come into a city that hath
walls, and gates, and bars." So he commanded all the people
suddenly, and when they had besieged and taken it to kill David.
But when David perceived this, and learned of God that if he
staid there the men of Keilah would deliver him up to Saul, he
took his four hundred men and retired into a desert that was over
against a city called Engedi. So that when the king heard he was
fled away from the men of Keilah, he left off his expedition
against him.
</p><p>2. Then David removed thence, and came to a certain place called
the New Place, belonging to Ziph; where Jonathan, the son of
Saul, came to him, and saluted him, and exhorted him to be of
good courage, and to hope well as to his condition hereafter, and
not to despond at his present circumstances, for that he should
be king, and have all the forces of the Hebrews under him: he
told him that such happiness uses to come with great labor and
pains: they also took oaths, that they would, all their lives
long, continue in good-will and fidelity one to another; and he
called God to witness, as to what execrations he had made upon
himself if he should transgress his covenant, and should change
to a contrary behavior. So Jonathan left him there, having
rendered his cares and fears somewhat lighter, and returned home.
Now the men of Ziph, to gratify Saul, informed him that David
abode with them, and [assured him] that if he would come to them,
they would deliver him up, for that if the king would seize on
the Straits of Ziph, David would not escape to any other people.
So the king commended them, and confessed that he had reason to
thank them, because they had given him information of his enemy;
and he promised them, that it should not be long ere he would
requite their kindness. He also sent men to seek for David, and
to search the wilderness wherein he was; and he promised that he
himself would follow them. Accordingly they went before the king,
to hunt for and to catch David, and used endeavors, not only to
show their good-will to Saul, by informing him where his enemy
was, but to evidence the same more plainly by delivering him up
into his power. But these men failed of those their unjust and
wicked desires, who, while they underwent no hazard by not
discovering such an ambition of revealing this to Saul, yet did
they falsely accuse and promise to deliver up a man beloved of
God, and one that was unjustly sought after to be put to death,
and one that might otherwise have lain concealed, and this out of
flattery, and expectation of gain from the king; for when David
was apprized of the malignant intentions of the men of Ziph, and
the approach of Saul, he left the Straits of that country, and
fled to the great rock that was in the wilderness of Maon.
</p><p>3. Hereupon Saul made haste to pursue him thither; for, as he was
marching, he learned that David was gone away from the Straits of
Ziph, and Saul removed to the other side of the rock. But the
report that the Philistines had again made an incursion into the
country of the Hebrews, called Saul another way from the pursuit
of David, when he was ready to be caught; for he returned back
again to oppose those Philistines, who were naturally their
enemies, as judging it more necessary to avenge himself of them,
than to take a great deal of pains to catch an enemy of his own,
and to overlook the ravage that was made in the land.
</p><p>4. And by this means David unexpectedly escaped out of the danger
he was in, and came to the Straits of Engedi; and when Saul had
driven the Philistines out of the land, there came some
messengers, who told him that David abode within the bounds of
Engedi: so he took three thousand chosen men that were armed, and
made haste to him; and when he was not far from those places, he
saw a deep and hollow cave by the way-side; it was open to a
great length and breadth, and there it was that David with his
four hundred men were concealed. When therefore he had occasion
to ease nature, he entered into it by himself alone; and being
seen by one of David's companions, and he that saw him saying to
him, that he had now, by God's providence, an opportunity of
avenging himself of his adversary; and advising him to cut off
his head, and so deliver himself out of that tedious, wandering
condition, and the distress he was in; he rose up, and only cut
off the skirt of that garment which Saul had on: but he soon
repented of what he had done; and said it was not right to kill
him that was his master, and one whom God had thought worthy of
the kingdom; "for that although he were wickedly disposed towards
us, yet does it not behoove me to be so disposed towards him."
But when Saul had left the cave, David came near and cried out
aloud, and desired Saul to hear him; whereupon the king turned
his face back, and David, according to custom, fell down on his
face before the king, and bowed to him; and said, "O king, thou
oughtest not to hearken to wicked men, nor to such as forge
calumnies, nor to gratify them so far as to believe what they
say, nor to entertain suspicions of such as are your best
friends, but to judge of the dispositions of all men by their
actions; for calumny deludes men, but men's own actions are a
clear demonstration of their kindness. Words indeed, in their own
nature, may be either true or false, but men's actions expose
their intentions nakedly to our view. By these, therefore it will
be well for thee to believe me, as to my regard to thee and to
thy house, and not to believe those that frame such accusations
against me as never came into my mind, nor are possible to be
executed, and do this further by pursuing after&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="171" data-page-number="171" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/185"></span></span>my life, and have
no concern either day or night, but how to compass my life and to
murder me, which thing I think thou dost unjustly prosecute; for
how comes it about, that thou hast embraced this false opinion
about me, as if I had a desire to kill thee? Or how canst thou
escape the crime of impiety towards God, when thou wishest thou
couldst kill, and deemest thine adversary, a man who had it in
his power this day to avenge himself, and to punish thee, but
would not do it? nor make use of such an opportunity, which, if
it had fallen out to thee against me, thou hadst not let it slip,
for when I cut off the skirt of thy garment, I could have done
the same to thy head." So he showed him the piece of his garment,
and thereby made him agree to what he said to be true; and added,
"I, for certain, have abstained from taking a just revenge upon
thee, yet art thou not ashamed to prosecute me with unjust
hatred. (23) May God do justice, and determine about each of our
dispositions." - But Saul was amazed at the strange delivery he
had received; and being greatly affected with the moderation and
the disposition of the young man, he groaned; and when David had
done the same, the king answered that he had the justest occasion
to groan, "for thou hast been the author of good to me, as I have
been the author of calamity to thee; and thou hast demonstrated
this day, that thou possessest the righteousness of the ancients,
who determined that men ought to save their enemies, though they
caught them in a desert place. I am now persuaded that God
reserves the kingdom for thee, and that thou wilt obtain the
dominion over all the Hebrews. Give me then assurances upon oath,
That thou wilt not root out my family, nor, out of remembrance of
what evil I have done thee, destroy my posterity, but save and
preserve my house." So David sware as he desired, and sent back
Saul to his own kingdom; but he, and those that were with him,
went up the Straits of Mastheroth.
</p><p>5. About this time Samuel the prophet died. He was a man whom the
Hebrews honored in an extraordinary degree: for that lamentation
which the people made for him, and this during a long time,
manifested his virtue, and the affection which the people bore
for him; as also did the solemnity and concern that appeared
about his funeral, and about the complete observation of all his
funeral rites. They buried him in his own city of Ramah; and wept
for him a very great number of days, not looking on it as a
sorrow for the death of another man, but as that in which they
were every one themselves concerned. He was a righteous man, and
gentle in his nature; and on that account he was very dear to
God. Now he governed and presided over the people alone, after
the death of Eli the high priest, twelve years, and eighteen
years together with Saul the king. And thus we have finished the
history of Samuel.
</p><p>6. There was a man that was a Ziphite, of the city of Maon, who
was rich, and had a vast number of cattle; for he fed a flock of
three thousand sheep, and another flock of a thousand goats. Now
David had charged his associates to keep these flocks without
hurt and without damage, and to do them no mischief, neither out
of covetousness, nor because they were in want, nor because they
were in the wilderness, and so could not easily be discovered,
but to esteem freedom from injustice above all other motives, and
to look upon the touching of what belonged to another man as a
horrible crime, and contrary to the will of God. These were the
instructions he gave, thinking that the favors he granted this
man were granted to a good man, and one that deserved to have
such care taken of his affairs. This man was Nabal, for that was
his name, - a harsh man, and of a very wicked life, being like a
cynic in the course of his behavior, but still had obtained for
his wife a woman of a good character, wise and handsome. To this
Nabal, therefore, David sent ten men of his attendants at the
time when he sheared his sheep, and by them saluted him; and also
wished he might do what he now did for many years to come, but
desired him to make him a present of what he was able to give
him, since he had, to be sure, learned from his shepherds that we
had done them no injury, but had been their guardians a long time
together, while we continued in the wilderness; and he assured
him he should never repent of giving any thing to David. When the
messengers had carried this message to Nabal, he accosted them
after an inhuman and rough manner; for he asked them who David
was? and when he heard that he was the son of Jesse, he said,
"Now is the time that fugitives grow insolent, and make a figure,
and leave their masters." When they told David this, he was
wroth, and commanded four hundred armed men to follow him, and
left two hundred to take care of the stuff, (for he had already
six hundred, (24)) and went against Nabal: he also swore that he
would that night utterly destroy the whole house and possessions
of Nabal; for that he was grieved, not only that he had proved&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="172" data-page-number="172" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/186"></span></span>ungrateful to them, without making any return for the humanity
they had shown him, but that he had also reproached them, and
used ill language to them, when he had received no cause of
disgust from them.
</p><p>7. Hereupon one of those that kept the flocks of Nabal, said to
his mistress, Nabal's wife, that when David sent to her husband
he had received no civil answer at all from him; but that her
husband had moreover added very reproachful language, while yet
David had taken extraordinary care to keep his flocks from harm,
and that what had passed would prove very pernicious to his
master. When the servant had said this, Abigail, for that was his
wife's name, saddled her asses, and loaded them with all sorts of
presents; and, without telling her husband any thing of what she
was about, (for he was not sensible on account of his
drunkenness,) she went to David. She was then met by David as she
was descending a hill, who was coming against Nabal with four
hundred men. When the woman saw David, she leaped down from her
ass, and fell on her face, and bowed down to the ground; and
entreated him not to bear in mind the words of Nabal, since he
knew that he resembled his name. Now Nabal, in the Hebrew tongue,
signifies folly. So she made her apology, that she did not see
the messengers whom he sent. "Forgive me, therefore," said she,
"and thank God, who hath hindered thee from shedding human blood;
for so long as thou keepest thyself innocent, he will avenge thee
of wicked men, (25) for what miseries await Nabal, they will fall
upon the heads of thine enemies. Be thou gracious to me, and
think me so far worthy as to accept of these presents from me;
and, out of regard to me, remit that wrath and that anger which
thou hast against my husband and his house, for mildness and
humanity become thee, especially as thou art to be our king."
Accordingly, David accepted her presents, and said, "Nay, but, O
woman, it was no other than God's mercy which brought thee to us
today, for, otherwise, thou hadst never seen another day, I
having sworn to destroy Nabal's house this very night, and to
leave alive not one of you who belonged to a man that was wicked
and ungrateful to me and my companions; but now hast thou
prevented me, and seasonably mollified my anger, as being thyself
under the care of God's providence: but as for Nabal, although
for thy sake he now escape punishment, he will not always avoid
justice; for his evil conduct, on some other occasion, will be
his ruin."
</p><p>8. When David had said this, he dismissed the woman. But when she
came home and found her husband feasting with a great company,
and oppressed with wine, she said nothing to him then about what
had happened; but on the next day, when he was sober, she told
him all the particulars, and made his whole body to appear like
that of a dead man by her words, and by that grief which arose
from them; so Nabal survived ten days, and no more, and then
died. And when David heard of his death, he said that God had
justly avenged him of this man, for that Nabal had died by his
own wickedness, and had suffered punishment on his account, while
he had kept his own hands clean. At which time he understood that
the wicked are prosecuted by God; that he does not overlook any
man, but bestows on the good what is suitable to them, and
inflicts a deserved punishment on the wicked. So he sent to
Nabal's wife, and invited her to come to him, to live with him,
and to be his wife. Whereupon she replied to those that came,
that she was not worthy to touch his feet; however, she came,
with all her servants, and became his wife, having received that
honor on account of her wise and righteous course of life. She
also obtained the same honor partly on account of her beauty. Now
David had a wife before, whom he married from the city Abesar;
for as to Michal, the daughter of king Saul, who had been David's
wife, her father had given her in marriage to Phalti, the son of
Laish, who was of the city of Gallim.
</p><p>9. After this came certain of the Ziphites, and told Saul that
David was come again into their country, and if he would afford
them his assistance, they could catch him. So he came to them
with three thousand armed men; and upon the approach of night, he
pitched his camp at a certain place called Hachilah. But when
David heard that Saul was coming against him, he sent spies, and
bid them let him know to what place of the country Saul was
already come; and when they told him that he was at Hachilah, he
concealed his going away from his companions, and came to Saul's&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="173" data-page-number="173" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/187"></span></span>camp, having taken with him Abishai, his sister Zeruiah's son,
and Ahimelech the Hittite. Now Saul was asleep, and the armed
men, with Abner their commander, lay round about him in a circle.
Hereupon David entered into the king's tent; but he did neither
kill Saul, though he knew where he lay, by the spear that was
stuck down by him, nor did he give leave to Abishai, who would
have killed him, and was earnestly bent upon it so to do; for he
said it was a horrid crime to kill one that was ordained king by
God, although he was a wicked man; for that he who gave him the
dominion would in time inflict punishment upon him. So he
restrained his eagerness; but that it might appear to have been
in his power to have killed him when he refrained from it, he
took his spear, and the cruse of water which stood by Saul as he
lay asleep, without being perceived by any in the camp, who were
all asleep, and went securely away, having performed every thing
among the king's attendants that the opportunity afforded, and
his boldness encouraged him to do. So when he had passed over a
brook, and was gotten up to the top of a hill, whence he might be
sufficiently heard, he cried aloud to Saul's soldiers, and to
Abner their commander, and awaked them out of their sleep, and
called both to him and to the people. Hereupon the commander
heard him, and asked who it was that called him. To whom David
replied, "It is I, the son of Jesse, whom you make a vagabond.
But what is the matter? Dost thou, that art a man of so great
dignity, and of the first rank in the king's court, take so
little care of thy master's body? and is sleep of more
consequence to thee than his preservation, and thy care of him?
This negligence of yours deserves death, and punishment to be
inflicted on you, who never perceived when, a little while ago,
some of us entered into your camp, nay, as far as to the king
himself, and to all the rest of you. If thou look for the king's
spear and his cruse of water, thou wilt learn what a mighty
misfortune was ready to overtake you in your very camp without
your knowing it." Now when Saul knew David's voice, and
understood that when he had him in his power while he was asleep,
and his guards took no care of him, yet did not he kill him, but
spared him, when he might justly have cut him off, he said that
he owed him thanks for his preservation; and exhorted him to be
of good courage, and not be afraid of suffering any mischief from
him any more, and to return to his own home, for he was now
persuaded that he did not love himself so well as he was loved by
him: that he had driven away him that could guard him, and had
given many demonstrations of his good-will to him: that he had
forced him to live so long in a state of banishment, and in great
fears of his life, destitute of his friends and his kindred,
while still he was often saved by him, and frequently received
his life again when it was evidently in danger of perishing. So
David bade them send for the spear and the cruse of water, and
take them back; adding this withal, That God would be the judge
of both their dispositions, and of the actions that flowed from
the same, "who knows that then it was this day in my power to
have killed thee I abstained from it."
</p><p>10. Thus Saul having escaped the hands of David twice, he went
his way to his royal palace, and his own city: but David was
afraid, that if he staid there he should be caught by Saul; so he
thought it better to go up into the land of the Philistines, and
abide there. Accordingly, he came with the six hundred men that
were with him to Achish, the king of Gath, which was one of their
five cities. Now the king received both him and his men, and gave
them a place to inhabit in. He had with him also his two wives,
Ahinoam and Abigail, and he dwelt in Gath. But when Saul heard
this, he took no further care about sending to him, or going
after him, because he had been twice, in a manner, caught by him,
while he was himself endeavoring to catch him. However, David had
no mind to continue in the city of Gath, but desired the king,
that since he had received him with such humanity, that he would
grant him another favor, and bestow upon him some place of that
country for his habitation, for he was ashamed, by living in the
city, to be grievous and burdensome to him. So Achish gave him a
certain village called Ziklag; which place David and his sons
were fond of when he was king, and reckoned it to be their
peculiar inheritance. But about those matters we shall give the
reader further information elsewhere. Now the time that David
dwelt in Ziklag, in the land of the Philistines, was four months
and twenty days. And now he privately attacked those Geshurites
and Amalekites that were neighbors to the Philistines, and laid
waste their country, and took much prey of their beasts and
camels, and then returned home; but David abstained from the men,
as fearing they should discover him to king Achish; yet did he
send part of the prey to him as a free gift. And when the king
inquired whom they had attacked when they brought away the prey,
he said, those that lay to the south of the Jews, and inhabited
in the plain; whereby he persuaded Achish to approve of what he
had done, for he hoped that David had fought against his own
nation, and that now he should have him for his servant all his
life long, and that he would stay in his country.
</p><p>CHAPTER 14.
</p><p>Now Saul Upon God's Not Answering Him Concerning The Fight With
The Philistines Desired A Necromantic Woman To Raise Up The Soul
Of Samuel To Him; And How He Died, With His Sons Upon The
Overthrow Of The Hebrews In Battle.
</p><p>1. About the same time the Philistines&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="174" data-page-number="174" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/188"></span></span>resolved to make war
against the Israelites, and sent to all their confederates that
they would go along with them to the war to Reggan, [near the
city Shunem,] whence they might gather themselves together, and
suddenly attack the Hebrews. Then did Achish, the king of Gath,
desire David to assist them with his armed men against the
Hebrews. This he readily promised; and said that the time was now
come wherein he might requite him for his kindness and
hospitality. So the king promised to make him the keeper of his
body, after the victory, supposing that the battle with the enemy
succeeded to their mind; which promise of honor and confidence he
made on purpose to increase his zeal for his service.
</p><p>2. Now Saul, the king of the Hebrews, had cast out of the country
the fortune-tellers, and the necromancers, and all such as
exercised the like arts, excepting the prophets. But when he
heard that the Philistines were already come, and had pitched
their camp near the city Shunem, situate in the plain, he made
haste to oppose them with his forces; and when he was come to a
certain mountain called Gilboa, he pitched his camp over-against
the enemy; but when he saw the enemy's army he was greatly
troubled, because it appeared to him to be numerous, and superior
to his own; and he inquired of God by the prophets concerning the
battle, that he might know beforehand what would be the event of
it. And when God did not answer him, Saul was under a still
greater dread, and his courage fell, foreseeing, as was but
reasonable to suppose, that mischief would befall him, now God
was not there to assist him; yet did he bid his servants to
inquire out for him some woman that was a necromancer and called
up the souls of the dead, that So he might know whether his
affairs would succeed to his mind; for this sort of necromantic
women that bring up the souls of the dead, do by them foretell
future events to such as desire them. And one of his servants
told him that there was such a woman in the city Endor, but was
known to nobody in the camp; hereupon Saul put off his royal
apparel, and took two of those his servants with him, whom he
knew to be most faithful to him, and came to Endor to the woman,
and entreated her to act the part of a fortune-teller, and to
bring up such a soul to him as he should name to her. But when
the woman opposed his motion, and said she did not despise the
king, who had banished this sort of fortune-tellers, and that he
did not do well himself, when she had done him no harm, to
endeavor to lay a snare for her, and to discover that she
exercised a forbidden art, in order to procure her to be
punished, he sware that nobody should know what she did; and that
he would not tell any one else what she foretold, but that she
should incur no danger. As soon as he had induced her by this
oath to fear no harm, he bid her bring up to him the soul of
Samuel. She, not knowing who Samuel was, called him out of Hades.
When he appeared, and the woman saw one that was venerable, and
of a divine form, she was in disorder; and being astonished at
the sight, she said, "Art not thou king Saul?" for Samuel had
informed her who he was. When he had owned that to be true, and
had asked her whence her disorder arose, she said that she saw a
certain person ascend, who in his form was like to a god. And
when he bid her tell him what he resembled, in what habit he
appeared, and of what age he was, she told him he was an old man
already, and of a glorious personage, and had on a sacerdotal
mantle. So the king discovered by these signs that he was Samuel;
and he fell down upon the ground, and saluted and worshipped him.
And when the soul of Samuel asked him why he had disturbed him,
and caused him to be brought up, he lamented the necessity he was
under; for he said, that his enemies pressed heavily upon him;
that he was in distress what to do in his present circumstances;
that he was forsaken of God, and could obtain no prediction of
what was coming, neither by prophets nor by dreams; and that
"these were the reasons why I have recourse to time, who always
took great care of me." But (27) Samuel, seeing that the end of
Saul's life was come, said, "It is in vain for thee to desire to
learn of me any thing future, when God hath forsaken thee:
however, hear what I say, that David is to be king, and to finish
this war with good success; and thou art to lose thy dominion and
thy life, because thou didst not obey God in the war with the
Amalekites, and hast not kept his commandments, as I foretold
thee while I was alive. Know, therefore, that the people shall be
made subject to their enemies, and that thou, with thy sons,
shall fall in the battle tomorrow, and thou shalt then be with me
[in Hades]."
</p><p>3. When Saul heard this, he could not speak for grief, and fell
down on the floor, whether it were from the sorrow that arose
upon what Samuel had said, or from his emptiness, for he had
taken no food the foregoing day nor night, he easily fell quite
down: and when with difficulty he had recovered himself, the
woman would force him to eat, begging this of him as a favor&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="175" data-page-number="175" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/189"></span></span>on
account of her concern in that dangerous instance of
fortune-telling, which it was not lawful for her to have done,
because of the fear she was under of the king, while she knew not
who he was, yet did she undertake it, and go through with it; on
which account she entreated him to admit that a table and food
might be set before him, that he might recover his strength, and
so get safe to his own camp. And when he opposed her motion, and
entirely rejected it, by reason of his anxiety, she forced him,
and at last persuaded him to it. Now she had one calf that she
was very fond of, and one that she took a great deal of care of,
and fed it herself; for she was a woman that got her living by
the labor of her own hands, and had no other possession but that
one calf; this she killed, and made ready its flesh, and set it
before his servants and himself. So Saul came to the camp while
it was yet night.
</p><p>4. Now it is but just to recommend the generosity of this woman,
(28) because when the king had forbidden her to use that art
whence her circumstances were bettered and improved, and when she
had never seen the king before, she still did not remember to his
disadvantage that he had condemned her sort of learning, and did
not refuse him as a stranger, and one that she had had no
acquaintance with; but she had compassion upon him, and comforted
him, and exhorted him to do what he was greatly averse to, and
offered him the only creature she had, as a poor woman, and that
earnestly, and with great humanity, while she had no requital
made her for her kindness, nor hunted after any future favor from
him, for she knew he was to die; whereas men are naturally either
ambitious to please those that bestow benefits upon them, or are
very ready to serve those from whom
they may receive some advantage. It would be well therefore to
imitate the example and to do kindnesses to all such as are in
want and to think that nothing is better, nor more becoming
mankind, than such a general beneficence, nor what will sooner
render God favorable, and ready to bestow good things upon us.
And so far may suffice to have spoken concerning this woman. But
I shall speak further upon another subject, which will afford me
all opportunity of discoursing on what is for the advantage of
cities, and people, and nations, and suited to the taste of good
men, and will encourage them all in the prosecution of virtue;
and is capable of showing them the of acquiring glory, and an
everlasting fame; and of imprinting in the kings of nations, and
the rulers of cities, great inclination and diligence of doing
well; as also of encouraging them to undergo dangers, and to die
for their countries, and of instructing them how to despise all
the most terrible adversities: and I have a fair occasion offered
me to enter on such a discourse by Saul the king of the Hebrews;
for although he knew what was coming upon him, and that he was to
die immediately, by the prediction of the prophet, he did not
resolve to fly from death, nor so far to indulge the love of life
as to betray his own people to the enemy, or to bring a disgrace
on his royal dignity; but exposing himself, as well as all his
family and children, to dangers, he thought it a brave thing to
fall together with them, as he was fighting for his subjects, and
that it was better his sons should die thus, showing their
courage, than to leave them to their uncertain conduct afterward,
while, instead of succession and posterity, they gained
commendation and a lasting name. Such a one alone seems to me to
be a just, a courageous, and a prudent man; and when any one has
arrived at these dispositions, or shall hereafter arrive at them,
he is the man that ought to be by all honored with the testimony
of a virtuous or courageous man: for as to those that go out to
war with hopes of success, and that they shall return safe,
supposing they should have performed some glorious action, I
think those do not do well who call these valiant men, as so many
historians and other writers who treat of them are wont to do,
although I confess those do justly deserve some commendation
also; but those only may be styled courageous and bold in great
undertakings, and despisers of adversities, who imitate Saul: for
as for those that do not know what the event of war will be as to
themselves, and though they do not faint in it, but deliver
themselves up to uncertain futurity, and are tossed this way and
that way, this is not so very eminent an instance of a generous
mind, although they happen to perform many great exploits; but
when men's minds expect no good event, but they know beforehand
they must die, and that they must undergo that death in the
battle also, after this neither to be aftrighted, nor to be
astonished at the terrible fate that is coming, but to go
directly upon it, when they know it beforehand, this it is that I
esteem the character of a man truly courageous. Accordingly this
Saul did, and thereby demonstrated that all men who desire fame
after they are dead are so to act as they may obtain the same:
this especially concerns kings, who ought not to think it enough
in their high stations that they are not wicked in the government
of their subjects, but to be no more than moderately good to
them. I could say more than this about Saul and his courage, the
subject affording matter sufficient; but that I may not appear to
run out improperly in his commendation, I return again to that
history from which I made this digression.
</p><p>5. Now when the Philistines, as I said before, had pitched their
camp, and had taken&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="176" data-page-number="176" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/190"></span></span>an account of their forces, according to
their nations, and kingdoms, and governments, king Achish came
last of all with his own army; after whom came David with his six
hundred armed men. And when the commanders of the Philistines saw
him, they asked the king whence these Hebrews came, and at whose
invitation. He answered that it was David, who was fled away from
his master Saul, and that he had entertained him when he came to
him, and that now he was willing to make him this requital for
his favors, and to avenge himself upon Saul, and so was become
his confederate. The commanders complained of this, that he had
taken him for a confederate who was an enemy; and gave him
counsel to send him away, lest he should unawares do his friends
a great deal of mischief by entertaining him, for that he
afforded him an opportunity of being reconciled to his master by
doing a mischief to our army. They thereupon desired him, out of
a prudent foresight of this, to send him away, with his six
hundred armed men, to the place he had given him for his
habitation; for that this was that David whom the virgins
celebrated in their hymns, as having destroyed many ten thousands
of the Philistines. When the king of Gath heard this, he thought
they spake well; so he called David, and said to him, "As for
myself, I can bear witness that thou hast shown great diligence
and kindness about me, and on that account it was that I took
thee for my confederate; however, what I have done does not
please the commanders of the Philistines; go therefore within a
day's time to the place I have given thee, without suspecting any
harm, and there keep my country, lest any of our enemies should
make an incursion upon it, which will be one part of that
assistance which I expect from thee." So David came to Ziklag, as
the king of Gath bade him; but it happened, that while he was
gone to the assistance of the Philistines, the Amalekites had
made an incursion, and taken Ziklag before, and had burnt it; and
when they had taken a great deal of other prey out of that place,
and out of the other parts of the Philistines' country, they
departed.
</p><p>6. Now when David found that Ziklag was laid waste, and that it
was all spoiled, and that as well his own wives, who were two, as
the wives of his companions, with their children, were made
captives, he presently rent his clothes, weeping and lamenting,
together with his friends; and indeed he was so cast down with
these misfortunes, that at length tears themselves failed him. He
was also in danger of being stoned to death by his companions,
who were greatly afflicted at the captivity of their wives and
children, for they laid the blame upon him of what had happened.
But when he had recovered himself out of his grief, and had
raised up his mind to God, he desired the high priest Abiathar to
put on his sacerdotal garments, and to inquire of God, and to
prophesy to him, whether God would grant; that if he pursued
after the Amalekites, he should overtake them, and save their
wives and their children, and avenge himself on the enemies. And
when the high priest bade him to pursue after them, he marched
apace, with his four hundred men, after the enemy; and when he
was come to a certain brook called Besor, and had lighted upon
one that was wandering about, an Egyptian by birth, who was
almost dead with want and famine, (for he had continued wandering
about without food in the wilderness three days,) he first of all
gave him sustenance, both meat and drink, and thereby refreshed
him. He then asked him to whom he belonged, and whence he came.
Whereupon the man told him he was an Egyptian by birth, and was
left behind by his master, because he was so sick and weak that
he could not follow him. He also informed him that he was one of
those who had burnt and plundered, not only other parts of Judea,
but Ziklag itself also. So David made use of him as a guide to
find oat the Amalekites; and when he had overtaken them, as they
lay scattered about on the ground, some at dinner, some
disordered, and entirely drunk with wine, and in the fruition of
their spoils and their prey, he fell upon them on the sudden, and
made a great slaughter among them; for they were naked, and
expected no such thing, but had betaken themselves to drinking
and feasting; and so they were all easily destroyed. Now some of
them that were overtaken as they lay at the table were slain in
that posture, and their blood brought up with it their meat and
their drink. They slew others of them as they were drinking to
one another in their cups, and some of them when their full
bellies had made them fall asleep; and for so many as had time to
put on their armor, they slew them with the sword, with no less
case than they did those that were naked; and for the partisans
of David, they continued also the slaughter from the first hour
of the day to the evening, so that there were, not above four
hundred of the Amalekites left; and they only escaped by getting
upon their dromedaries and camels. Accordingly David recovered
not only all the other spoils which the enemy had carried away,
but his wives also, and the wives of his companions. But when
they were come to the place where they had left the two hundred
men, which were not able to follow them, but were left to take
care of the stuff, the four hundred men did not think fit to
divide among them any other parts of what they had gotten, or of
the prey, since they did not accompany them, but pretended to be
feeble, and did not follow them in pursuit of the enemy, but said
they should be contented to have safely recovered their wives;
yet did David pronounce that this opinion of theirs was evil and
unjust, and that when God had granted them such a favor, that
they had avenged themselves on their enemies, and had recovered
all that belonged to themselves, they should make an equal
distribution of what they had gott&#32;<span><span class="pagenum ws-pagenum" id="177" data-page-number="177" title="Page:Works_Translated_by_William_Whiston.djvu/191"></span></span>en to all, because the rest had
tarried behind to guard their stuff; and from that time this law
obtained among them, that those who guarded the stuff, should
receive an equal share with those that fought in the battle. Now
when David was come to Ziklag, he sent portions of the spoils to
all that had been familiar with him, and to his friends in the
tribe of Judah. And thus ended the affairs of the plundering of
Ziklag, and of the slaughter of the Amalekites.
</p><p>7. Now upon the Philistines joining battle, there followed a
sharp engagement, and the Philistine, became the conquerors, and
slew a great number of their enemies; but Saul the king of
Israel, and his sons, fought courageously, and with the utmost
alacrity, as knowing that their entire glory lay in nothing else
but dying honorably, and exposing themselves to the utmost danger
from the enemy (for they had nothing else to hope for); so they
brought upon themselves the whole power of the enemy, till they
were encompassed round and slain, but not before they had killed
many of the Philistines Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and
Abinadab, and Malchisua; and when these were slain the multitude
of the Hebrews were put to flight, and all was disorder, and
confusion, and slaughter, upon the Philistines pressing in upon
them. But Saul himself fled, having a strong body of soldiers
about him; and upon the Philistines sending after them those that
threw javelins and shot arrows, he lost all his company except a
few. As for himself, he fought with great bravery; and when he
had received so many wounds, that he was not able to bear up nor
to oppose any longer, and yet was not able to kill himself, he
bade his armor-bearer draw his sword, and run him through, before
the enemy should take him alive. But his armor-bearer not daring
to kill his master, he drew his own sword, and placing himself
over against its point, he threw himself upon it; and when he
could neither run it through him, nor, by leaning against it,
make the sword pass through him, he turned him round, and asked a
certain young man that stood by who he was; and when he
understood that he was an Amalekite, he desired him to force the
sword through him, because he was not able to do it with his own
hands, and thereby to procure him such a death as he desired.
This the young man did accordingly; and he took the golden
bracelet that was on Saul's arm, and his royal crown that was on
his head, and ran away. And when Saul's armor-bearer saw that he
was slain, he killed himself; nor did any of the king's guards
escape, but they all fell upon the mountain called Gilboa. But
when those Hebrews that dwelt in the valley beyond Jordan, and
those who had their cities in the plain, heard that Saul and his
sons were fallen, and that the multitude about them were
destroyed, they left their own cities, and fled to such as were
the best fortified and fenced; and the Philistines, finding those
cities deserted, came and dwelt in them.
</p><p>8. On the next day, when the Philistines came to strip their
enemies that were slain, they got the bodies of Saul and of his
sons, and stripped them, and cut off their heads; and they sent
messengers all about their country, to acquaint them that their
enemies were fallen; and they dedicated their armor in the temple
of Astarte, but hung their bodies on crosses at the walls of the
city Bethshun, which is now called Scythepolls. But when the
inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead heard that they had dismembered the
dead bodies of Saul and of his sons, they deemed it so horrid a
thing to overlook this barbarity, and to suffer them to be
without funeral rites, that the most courageous and hardy among
them (and indeed that city had in it men that were very stout
both in body and mind) journeyed all night, and came to Bethshun,
and approached to the enemy's wall, and taking down the bodies of
Saul and of his sons, they carried them to Jabesh, while the
enemy were not able enough nor bold enough to hinder them,
because of their great courage. So the people of Jabesh wept all
in general, and buried their bodies in the best place of their
country, which was named Areurn; and they observed a public
mourning for them seven days, with their wives and children,
beating their breasts, and lamenting the king and his sons,
without either tasting meat or drink (29) [till the evening.]
</p><p>9. To this his end did Saul come, according to the prophecy of
Samuel, because he disobeyed the commands of God about the
Amalekites, and on the account of his destroying the family of
Ahimelech the high priest, with Ahimelech himself, and the city
of the high priests. Now Saul, when he had reigned eighteen years
while Samuel was alive, and after his death two [and twenty],
ended his life in this manner.&#32;
