        "One who reads the megilla may stand or sit.  If one read it or two read it, they are yotze.  In a place where it was customary to bless, they would bless, and (where it was custom) not to bless, they didn’t bless.  On Monday, Thursday, and Shabbat mincha three read.  They do not diminish or add to them, and they do not have a haftora from nevi’im.  The one who opens and seals (closes) in the torah blesses before it and after it.", 
        "On Rosh Chodesh and Chol Hamo’ed four read.  They do not diminish or add to them, and they do not have a haftora in nevi’im.  The one who opens and seals blesses before and after it.  This is the general rule, all which they read musaf and isn’t Yom Tov, four read.  On Yom Tov, five.  On Yom Hakippurim, six.  On Shabbat, seven.  They do not diminish, but they may add, and they have a haftora from nevi’im.  The one who opens and seals the torah blesses before and after.", 
        "One who is not pores shma (the meaning of this is debated) does not, pass before the ark (be a shali’ach tzibur), raise the hands (the kohanim bless), read from the torah, have a haftora from nevi’im, stand and sit (as part of the process of burial), say the blessing of the mourners, the consolation of mourners, the blessing of grooms, or have a zimun using the name of Hashem with less than ten (men).  And for (evaluating) lands, nine plus a kohen, and (evaluating) a person, the same as them (in number).", 
        "One who reads in the torah will not (recite) less than three psukim.  He will not read for a translator more than one pasuk, and in navi three.  If the three (psukim in navi) were three sections (each was a different topic) they read each one (separately).  They may skip in navi but may not skip in torah.  And how much can he skip?  Such that (the time needed to roll the scroll) will not stop the translator.", 
        "The one who read the haftora from navi is pores shma, he (may) pass before the ark, and he (may) raise his.  And if he was a minor, his father or rebbe pass (read and are shali’ach tzibur) for him.", 
        "A minor may read in the torah or translate, but he may not be pores shma, pass before the ark, or raise his hands.  One who is wearing torn clothing may be pores shma and translate, but he may not read from the torah, pass before the ark, or raise his hands.  A blind person may be pores shma and translate.  Rabi Yehuda says, one who never saw the luminaries in all his days may not be pores shma.", 
        "A kohen who has blemishes on his hands may not raise his hands.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one whose hands were painted with istis (woad, a blue dye) and puah (madder, a red dye) may not raise his hands since the nation looks at him.", 
        "One who says, I will not pass before the ark in colored (clothes) may not pass even in white (for this vow was a sign of heresy).  (If he says) I will pass in a sandal, even barefoot he may not pass.  One who makes his tfilla (tfillin) round, it is a danger, and there is no mitzva in it.  If he put it on his forehead or his palm, this is heresy (for they took the psukim about the placement of tfillin literally).  If he covered them with gold and put them on the sleeve of his undergarment, this is an outsider’s way.", 
        "One who says, may the good ones bless you, this is the way of heresy.  (If one says) on a bird’s nest extends your mercy, for good will your Name be remembered, or thank You thank You, they quiet him.  One who modifies types of inappropriate sex, they silence him.  One who says, and from your children you should not give to pass by Molech, and from your children you should not give to an Arab woman, they silence him rebukingly (for this changes the meaning of the pasuk).", 
        "The incident of Reuven (with Bilha’s bed) is read but not translated.  The incident of Tamar is read and translated.  The beginning of the incident of the calf is read and translated, and the end is read but not translated.  The blessing of the kohanim and the incident of David and Amnon are not read and are not translated.  They do not make a maftir of the chariot, and Rabi Yehuda allows.  Rabi Eliezer says, the do not make a  maftir of, “inform Yerushalayim.”"
