        "If one took part of truma and ma’asrot, he may take from that (heap) truma for it, but not for another place.  Rabi Meir says, he may even take from it for trumot and ma’asrot for another place.", 
        "One who had his produce in a storehouse, and he gave a se’ah to a levi and a se’ah to a poor person, he may take another eight se’ah (which are now chulin) and eat them according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, he may not take except for the exact amount (left, for if the trumot and ma’asrot have been eaten he can’t take the full amount).", 
        "The amount that is taken for truma, a generous person, one in forty.  Beit Shamay says, one in thirty.  The average, (one) from fifty, and the stingy (one) from sixty.  If he separated and found it to be one in sixty, it is truma, but he should go back and separate until it is as he normally takes, in the measure, weight, and number.  Rabi Yehuda says, it can even be from one isn’t close by.", 
        "One who says to his messenger, go and take truma, he takes according to the opinion of the owner.  If he doesn’t know the opinion of the owner, he takes as an average person, one in fifty.  If he lowered by ten or added ten, his truma is truma.  If he intended to add even one, it is not truma.", 
        "One who wishes to give more truma, Rabi Eliezer says, one tenth is the maximum, like trumat ma’aser.  If he took more than this, he should take trumat ma’aser on another place too.  Rabi Yishma’el says, half of it is truma and half is chulin.  Rabi Tarfon and Rabi Akiva say, as long as some chulin is left (he may take all he wants).", 
        "Three times one measures his baskets, for the first ripe fruits, the last summer fruits, and the middle of the summer.  One who counts is praiseworthy, one who measures is even more praiseworthy, and one who weighs is the most praiseworthy.", 
        "Rabi Eliezer says, truma is nullified by one hundred to one.  Rabi Yehoshua says, in a hundred plus, and for the ‘plus’ there is no (set) measure.  Rabi Yossi ben Meshulam says, ‘plus’ is a kav per hundred se’ah, (‘plus’) is one sixth of what makes meduma.", 
        "Rabi Yehoshua says, black figs annul white ones (combine to help annul a mixture of meduma), white ones annul for the black ones, by pressed fig cakes, large annul the small and small annul the large, cakes annul the white ones, and the white ones annul cakes.  Rabi Eliezer makes this assur.  Rabi Akiva says, if you know what fell, they don’t help annul, but if you don’t know, they do help annul.", 
        "When?  Fifty black figs and fifty white, if a black one fell in, the black are assur and the white are mutar, if a white one fell, the white are assur and the black are mutar.  If you don’t know what fell, one helps annul the other.  And in this Rabi Eliezer is strict, and Rabi Yehoshua is lenient.", 
        "And in this Rabi Eliezer is lenient and Rabi Yehoshua is strict, one who pressed a litra (a measurement) of dried figs on the mouth of a jug (filled with a hundred litra of figs), and he doesn’t know which it is (tevel or chulin dried figs), Rabi Eliezer says, we see them as if they are separate (as in they scattered amongst each other), and the ones one the bottom annul the ones on the top, but Rabi Yehoshua says, it isn’t considered as rising up until there are one hundred jars there.", 
        "A se’ah of truma which fell onto a stored pile and skimmed off the top layer.  Rabi Eliezer said, if the skimmed off portion is one hundred se’ah, it becomes annulled in one hundred one.  Rabi Yehoshua says, it won’t annul.  A se’ah of truma which fell on a stored pile, he must skim it odd.  If so, why did they say truma is nullified in one hundred one?  If he doesn’t know if they mixed, or where it fell.", 
        "Two baskets or two piles into one of which a se’ah of truma fell and it’s not know into which one, they annul one another.  Rabi Shimon says, even if they are in two towns they combine.", 
        "Rabi Yossi said, once a case came before Rabi Akiva where fifty bundles of vegetables into which one fell which was half truma, and I said before hum, it is annulled, not that fifty-one annulled, but rather that there were one hundred two halves there."
