        "For truma and bikurim one is chayav death and chomesh, they are assur to zarim, they are the property of a kohen, they are nullified by one in a hundred, and they require washing hands and sundown (for one who immersed that day).  These are applicable by both truma and bikurim, but not ma’aser.", 
        "There are (laws) by ma’aser and bikurim that are not like those of truma, for ma’aser and bikurim must be brought somewhere (Jerusalem), they require confession, and they are assur for a griever.  Rabi Shimon allows it (for a griever).  They are chayav in biur, and Rabi Shimon exempts them.  They make assur in any amount (when mixed with chulin) in Yerushalayim and their growth is assur to eat (as chulin when the growth occurred) in Yerushalayim, even to a zar or animal.  Rabi Shimon allows it.  Behold, these (laws) are by ma’aser and bikurim but are not like those of truma.", 
        "These are (laws) by truma and ma’aser that aren’t by bikurim, truma and ma’aser are make the (product of the) threshing floor assur (before they are taken), they have a measurement, they apply to all produce, they are when there is a Beit Hamikdash and when there isn’t, and they are by the tenant, lessee, one who extracts land through terror, and thieves.  These are by truma and ma’aser but not by bikurim.", 
        "And there are (laws) by bikurim which there aren’t by bikurim and ma’asrot.  For bikurim are acquired while attached to the ground, a person can make hi whole field bikurim, one is responsible for them, and they require a korban, song, waving, and staying overnight.", 
        "Trumat ma’aser is equivalent to bikurim in two ways, and to truma in two ways.  One may take from the tahor on the tame or that which isn’t nearby, like bikurim, and it makes the threshing floor assur and has a measurement, like truma.", 
        "An etrog is like a tree in three ways, and like a vegetable in one.  It is like a tree in orla, revai, and shvi’it.  And to a vegetable in one way, that the time you collect it is the time it becomes assur (before tithing), According to Raban Gamliel.  Rabi Eliezer says, it is like a tree in every way.", 
        "The blood of something that walks on two (limbs, referring to humans) is like the blood of an animal, in that it makes seeds susceptible (to tuma).  (Human blood, like) the blood of a sheretz, doesn’t make one chayav (for having eaten blood).", 
        "The koy (an animal) in some ways is like a wild animal, in some ways is like a domesticated animal, in some ways is like a wild animal and a domesticated animal, and in some ways is like neither a wild nor domesticated animal.", 
        "How is it (a koy) like a wild animal?  Its blood must be covered like that of a wild animal and one may not shecht it on Yom Tov.  If one did shecht it (on Yom Tov) he does not cover the blood.  Its fat contaminates with the tuma of an animal carrion, it’s tuma is in doubt, and one does not redeem the first born.", 
        "How is it like a domesticated animal?  Its fat is assur like the fat of a domesticated animal and one isn’t chayav karet for (eating the fat of) it.  It may not be bought with ma’aser sheni money to be eaten in Yerushalayim and one owes (the kohen) the shank bone, the cheeks, and the maw.  Rabi Eliezer exempts (from these gifts) for (there is a concept of) the one who is taking from his friend bears the burden of proof.", 
        "How is it like neither a wild animal nor a domesticated animal?  It is assur because of kilayim with either a wild or domesticated animal.  One who wrote over his wild or domesticated animals to his son didn’t write over his koy.  If he said, I am a nazir if this is a wild or domesticated animal, he is a nazir.  All the rest of its rules are like a wild animal and domesticated animal, it needs schita like both of them, it gives tuma of animal carrion and (is chayav in) tearing flesh from a live animal like both of them."
