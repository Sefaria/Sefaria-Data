        "Wheat and darnel (a grain that grows among wheat) don’t make each other kilayim.  Barley and oats, spelt and rye, beans and chickpeas, bitter peas and vetchling, and white beans and kidney beans, don’t make each other kilayim.", 
        "Squash and cucumber aren’t kilayim.  Rabi Yehuda says they are.  Lettuce and wild lettuce, endive and wild endive, leek and wild leek, coriander and wild coriander, mustard and Egyptian mustard, Egyptian gourd and bitter apple, and Egyptian beans and carob aren’t kilayim with each other.", 
        "Turnip and radish, cabbage and cauliflower, and beer and orach (a kind of beet) aren’t kilayim.  Rabi Akiva added garlic and small garlic, onion and small onion, and lupine and wild lupine.", 
        "And by trees, pears and small wild pears and quince and sorb-apples aren’t kilayim.  Apple and crab apple, peaches and almonds, and plums and pomegranates, even though they are similar, they are kilayim.", 
        "Radish and horse-radish, mustard and wild mustard, and Greek gourd with either Egyptian gourd or bitter-apple, even though they are similar, they are kilayim.", 
        "The wolf and the dog, the wild dog and the fox, goats and deer, mountain goats and ewes, the horse and the mule, the mule and the donkey, and the donkey and the wild donkey, even though they are similar, they are kilayim.", 
        "One may not graft a tree on a tree, an herb on an herb, a tree on an herb, or an herb on a tree.  Rabi Yehuda allows an herb on a tree.", 
        "One may not plant herbs in the stump of a sycamore, one may not graft rue onto white cassia because it is an herb onto a tree, and one may not plant the shoot of a fig tree into a cistus in order to cool the cistus.  One may not put the cutting of grape into a watermelon such that it will water the cutting, because it is a tree onto an herb.  One may not put the seeds of a gourd into a mallow to preserve it, because it is an her in an herb.", 
        "One who buries turnip and radish under grapes, if they were partially exposed, there is no worry about kilayim, shmitta, or ma’aser, and you can dig them up on Shabbat.  One who sows wheat and barley together is doing kilayim,  Rabi Yehuda says, it is only kilayim if it is two species of one and one of the other or wheat, barley, and spelt."
