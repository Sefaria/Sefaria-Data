        "He shook the urn and lifted the two lots.  One was written on it, for Hashem, and on was written on for Azazel (hell).  The sgan is to his right and the head of his father’s house is to the left.  If the one for Hashem came up in his right, the sgan says to him, my lord the kohen gadol, raise your right (hand).  And if the one for Hashem came up in his left, the head of his father’s house says to him, my lord the kohen gadol, raise your right.  He puts them on the two goats and says, for Hashem a chatat.  Rabi Yishma’el says, he didn’t need to say, a chatat, only, for Hashem.  And they answer after him, blessed is His holy name and His kingship for ever and eternity.", 
        "He tied a strip of crimson (wool) on the head of the scapegoat and stood it pointing toward the place of sending out, and the one to be slaughtered toward the place of slaughtering.  He came to his bull a second time and he placed both his hands on it and confessed.  And he would say please Hashem I have done wrong, I have been negligent, I have sinned before you, me and my house.  Please Hashem, please atone for the wrongs, the negligences, and the sins which I did wrong, was negligent, and sinned before you, me and my house, as is written in the torah of Moshe your servant, “for on this day he will make atonement upon you etc.”  And they would answer after him, “blessed is His holy name and His kingship for ever and eternity.”", 
        "He slaughtered it and took its blood in a bowl, and he gave it to the one who was to stir it in the fourth terrace of the sanctuary so that it doesn’t coagulate.  He took a pan and went up to the top of the mizbe’ach and cleared coals to this way and that, scoops from the innermost consumed (brunt) ones and went down and rested it in the fourth terrace in the sanctuary.", 
        "One all (other) days he would scoop with silver and pour into a gold one, and that day he would scoop with gold and with it he would bring in.  All days he would scoop with one of four kav and pour into one of three kav, and on that day he would scoop with one of thee kav and bring in.  Rabi Yossi says, on all days he would scoop with one of a se’ah (six kav) and pour into one of three kav and on that day he would scoop with one of three kav and bring in.  On all days it was heavy, and on that day it was light.  On all days its handle was short, and on that day it was long.  On all days the gold was yellow, and on that day it was red according to Rabi Menachem.  On all days he would offer a pras (half a maneh, of incense) in the morning and a pras in the afternoon, and on that day he added the size of his handfuls.  On all days it was thin (the pieces of the incense), and on that day it was the thinnest of thin.", 
        "On all days the kohanim go up in the east of the ramp and come down in its west, and on that day the kohen gadol would go up in the middle and come down in the middle.  Rabi Yehuda say, the kohen gadol always goes up in the middle and comes down in the middle.  All days the kohen gadol washes his hands and feet from the sink, and that day from the golden jug.  Rabi Yehuda says, the kohen gadol always washes his hands and feet from the golden jug.", 
        "On all days they were four woodpiles there, and on that day five, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, every day there were three, and on that day four.  Rabi Yehuda says, on all days there were two and on that day three."
