        "Rabi Eliezer says, one who weaves three strings at the beginning (starting a new garment) or one on a woven patch is chayav.  Chachamim say, whether it’s the beginning or the end, the set measurement is two stings.", 
        "One who makes two loops, if on heddles (a part of the loom), the sley (an implement which aids the weaving process), the sieve, the sifter, or the basket, is chayav.  And one who sows, two stitches, and one who rips, in order to sow two stitches.", 
        "One who tears in anger or for the dead, or anything destructive, is patur.  One who destroys in order to fix, the set measurement is like one who fixes.", 
        "The set measurement of one who bleaches, cards, dyes, and spins, enough to fill a sit (a measurement) twice.  And one who weaves two strings, the set measurement is to fill a sit.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda says, one who traps a bird into a tower (a closet considered a trap for birds) or a deer into a house is chayav.  Chachamim say, a bird into a tower and a deer into a house, courtyard, or vivarium.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, not all vivariums are the same.  This is the general rule, if it’s missing (a final) trapping, he’s patur, and what isn’t missing trapping (i.e. is trapped in a sufficiently small area), he’s chayav.", 
        "A deer which entered and one locked it in, he’s chayav.  If two locked him in, they’re patur.  If one couldn’t lock it (alone) and two did, they’re chayav, and Rabi Shimon exempts them.", 
        "If one sat in the entrance (to the place the deer was)and didn’t fill it, and a second sat and filled it, the second is chayav.  If the first sat in the entrance and filled it, and a second came and sat next to him, even if the first one got up and left, the first is chayav and the second patur.  Behold, what is this like?  Like one who locks a house in order to guard it, and a deer was guarded (by someone else) in the house already."
