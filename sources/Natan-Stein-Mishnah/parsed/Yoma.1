        "Seven days prior to Yom Hakippurim they take the kohen gadol from his house to the palhedrin chamber, and they set for him another kohen under him for perhaps an invalidating thing will befall him.  Rabi Yehuda says, they even establish another wife for him, for it says, “and he will atone on his behalf and on behalf of his house,” his house, this is his wife.  They said to him, if so, the thing has no end (we would need to give him an unending number of wives to ensure that he will have a living wife that day).", 
        "All the seven days he sprinkles the blood, offers the incense, sets up the candles (of the menorah), and offers the head and the leg (of the tamid).  And all the other days (of the year) if he wants to offer, he offers, for the kohen gadol is at the head (has the first right) in offering a portion, and is at the head in taking a portion.", 
        "They gave him elders from the elders of the court and they would read before him the order (service) of the day and say to him, my lord the kohen gadol, read it with your mouth (yourself) for perhaps you forgot or perhaps you didn’t learn.  The morning of the eve of You Hakippurim, they stand him up in the eastern gat and they pass before him bulls, rams, and sheep such that he will know and be familiar with the service.", 
        "The whole seven days they wouldn’t withhold from him food and drink.  On the eve of Yom Hakippurim when it darkens they would not let him eat much, because food brings on sleep.", 
        "The elders of the court would hand him over to the elders of the kohanim and they brought him up to the upper chamber of the house of Avtinas and they (the elders of the court) made him swear (that he would not change in the service) and they took their leave and left.  They said to him (for the oath) my lord the kohen gadol, we are messengers of the court and you are our messenger and a messenger of the court, we make you swear by the One who dwells His name in this house that you will not change a thing from everything we have told you.  And he turns aside and cries (they suspected him of being a Sadducee) and they turn aside and weep (they inappropriately suspected him).", 
        "If he was wise, he would expound (psukim for himself) and if not, the scholars would expound before him.  If he regularly read (in scripture), and if not they would read before him.  And from what do they read before him?  From Iyov (Job), Ezra, and Divrei Hayamim (Chronicles).  Zecharia ben Kvutal says, many times I read before him in Daniel.", 
        "If he asked to doze, the young kohanim snap before him with their middle finger and they would say to him, my lord the kohen gadol, stand up and drive away (sleep) once on the floor (which was cold).  And they kept him busy until the time of slaughtering arrived.", 
        "Every day they take (ashes) from the mizbe’ach by kriyat gever (an unclear time in the morning) whether before or after it, on Yom Hakippurim from midnight and on, and on the holidays from the first watch (after a third of the night) and kriyat hagever wouldn’t be reached before the time that the courtyard was filled with Jews (i.e. this would occur before kriyat hagever)."
