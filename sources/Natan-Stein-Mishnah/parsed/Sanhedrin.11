        "These are the people who one who strikes his parents, one who kidnaps a Jew, an elder who rebels against the court’s decision, a false prophet, one who prophesies for idolatry, the adulterer, and those who testify falsely against a kohen’s daughter and her husband.  One who strikes his parents isn’t chayav until he wounds them.  This is a stringency of cursing over wounding, for one who curses his parents after death is liable, but one who strikes after death isn’t.  The kidnapper isn’t chayav until he brings the person into his domain.  Rabi Yehuda says, until he brings him into his domain and uses him as a slave, as it is said, “he will make him a slave and sell him.”  One who kidnaps his son, Rabi Yishma’el the son or Rabi Yochanan be Bruka makes him chayav, and the Chachamim make him patur.  One who kidnapped someone who was half slave and half free (one of his joint masters freed him), Rabi Yehuda makes him Chayav and Chachamim make him patur.", 
        "An elder who rebels against the court’s decision, as it says, “when a thing will be strange for you in judgment etc.”  Three courts were there, one sitting at the entrance to the Temple Mount, one sitting at the entrance of the Temple, and one sitting in the Gazit Chamber.  People would come to that at the entrance to the Temple Mount, and say, this is how I interpreted, and this is how my friends interpreted, this is how I learned, and this is how my friends learned.  If they had learned about this case, they would tell them, and if not, they bring them to the court at the entrance to the Temple, and he repeats the case.  If they had learned about this case, they tell them, and if not, they all go to the court in the Gazit Chamber, for there Torah can be put out on all Jews, as it says “from that place which Hashem will choose.”  He returns to his town, and if he learns like she should, he’s patur.  But, if he continues to rule that they should do like him, he’s chayav, as it says, “the person who does with premeditation.”  He is not liable until he rules what is to be done.  A student (who is not yet allowed to rule) who ruled to do is patur, because his severity (that he isn’t allowed to rule) is his leniency (because people won’t listen to him, so it doesn’t matter if he ruled rebelliously).", 
        "We are more stringent about expounded laws than laws from the torah (when it comes to a rebellious elder).  One who says, there is not tfillin, in order to transgress a torah law, he’s patur (nobody will follow this absurdity).  One who says tfillin have five compartments, to add to expounded laws, he’s chayav.", 
        "Neither the court in his town nor the court in Yavneh puts him to death, rather they bring him to the great court in Jerusalem.  And they keep him until the closest holiday and they kill him on the holiday, as it says, “and all the nation shall see, hear, and stop being presumptuous,” according to Rabi Akiva.  Rabi Yehuda says, we do not delay his justice, rather we kill him instantly and write messages and send messengers to all places saying, such and such a person was put to death at the hand of the court.", 
        "A false prophet who prophesies on what he did not hear and what was not told him is killed by people.  But one who hold back prophesy, disregards what a prophet told him, or does something contrary to what Hashem told him is killed by Hashem, as it says, “I will require [the punishment] of him.”", 
        "One who prophesies in the name of idolatry and says, such told me an idol, even if it is in accordance with halacha, like declaring the impure impure and the pure pure.  One who commits adultery, since he entered the domain of the husband, even though the marriage hasn’t been consummated, one who has sex with her is strangled.  And those who testify falsely about the daughter of a kohen and her husband, for all zomemim (false witnesses) have the same death (as what they accused) except for those who testify about a kohen’s daughter and her husband."
