        "One who slaughters and offers outside (of the Beit Hamikdash), he is chayav for slaughtering and chayav for offering.  Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, if he slaughtered inside and offered outside, he is chayav, but is he slaughtered outside and offered outside, he is patur, for he offered outside nothing other than something pasul.  They said to him, also one who slaughtered inside and offered outside, since when he brought it out he made it pasul.", 
        "A tame person who ate (kodesh meat) whether tam kodesh or tahor kodesh, he’s chayav.  Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, a tam who ate tahor (meat) is chayav, but a tame who ate tame is patur, for he ate nothing other than something tame.  They said to him, also a tam who ate tahor, since when he touched it, he made it tame.  And a tahor who ate tame is patur, for he is not chayav except on the tuma of the body (when he is tame).", 
        "(There is) a stringency by slaughtering more than offering, and by offering more than slaughtering.  The stringency by slaughtering is that one who slaughters for a layman (as opposed to for Hashem) is chayav, but one who offers for a layman is patur.  The stringency by offering is that two people who held a knife and slaughtered (inappropriately) are patur, but if they (each) grasped a limb and offered it, they are chayav.  If he offered (outside accidentally), returned (after removing the offering), offered (again accidentally), returned, and offered, he is chayav for each offering according to Rabi Shimon.  Rabi Yossi says, he is only chayav for one, and he isn’t chayav until it goes up to the top of an altar.  Rabi Shimon says, even if he offered it on a rock or a stone, he is chayav.", 
        "Whether kosher kodesh (meats) or pasul kodesh, if their invalidation was in the kodesh (Beit Hamikdash) , if he offered them outside, he’s chayav.  One who offers a kzayit of an olah or a kzayit of the portions outside is chayav.  The handful (taken from a mincha), frankincense, incense, a mincha of the kohanim, mincha of the anointed kohen, or a libation mincha, which one offered a kzayit of outside he’s chayav.  Rabi Elazar exempts until he offers all of it.  And all of them if he offered inside, left a kzayit, and offered that outside, he’s chayav.  And all of them which left out anything at all (part was lost before it was burned inside).  If he offered them outside, he’s patur.", 
        "One who offers holies and their portions outside is chayav.  A mincha which did not have a handful taken and was offered outside, is patur.  If he took the handful and the handful went back into it (the mincha), it’s chayav (if offered outside).", 
        "The handful and the frankincense that he offered one of them outside, he’s chayav.  Rabi Eliezer exempts until he offers the other (too).  (If he offered) one inside and one outside, he’s chayav.  Two dishes of frankincense one of which he offered outside, he’s chayav.  Rabi Eliezer exempts until he offers the second.  If one (was offered) inside and one outside, he’s chayav.  One who sprinkles a little blood outside is chayav.  Rabi Eliezer says, also one who pours (as a libation) the waters of Sukkot on Sukkot outside is chayav.  Rabi Nechemia says, the leftovers of the blood (after sprinkling) which he sprinkled outside, he’s chayav.", 
        "One who does melika on fowl (squeezing the blood out from the neck on the side of the mizbe’ach) inside and offered it outside, he’s chaya.  If he did melika outside and offered outside, he’s patur.  One who slaughters fowl inside and offers it outside, he’s patur.  If he slaughtered outside and offered inside, he’s chayav.  If its way of readying (for it to be able to be a korban) is found to be inside (such that he will be chayav if he offers it outside), he is patur (if he readied it and offered it) outside.  If the way of readying is found to be outside, he is patur inside.  Rabi Shimon says, whatever one is chayav for outside, one is chayav for something similar inside which he (then) offered outside, except one who slaughters inside and offers outside.", 
        "A chatat which he collected the blood of in one cup, and he gave (sprinkled) outside and returned and gave inside, he is chayav, for all of it is fit (supposed) to come (be sprinkled) inside.  If he collected its blood in two cups, if he gave both of them inside, he’s patur, both of them outside, he’s chayav, one inside and (then) one outside, patur, or one outside and one inside, he’s chayav for the external, but the internal atones.  What is the thing similar to?  To one who separated (and animal to be) a chatat, it got lost, he separated another in its stead, and then the first one was found.  Behold, both of them are standing (he has two animals for one chatat).  If he slaughtered both of them inside, he’s patur, if he slaughtered both of them outside, he’s chayav, one inside and (then) one outside, he’s patur, or one outside and one inside, he’s chayav for the external, but the internal atones.  Just as the (sprinkling of the) blood exempts the flesh (from the rules of ritual misappropriation), so too he (one animal) exempts the flesh of his fellow."
