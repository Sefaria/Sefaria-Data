        "Rabi Eliezer says, one may hang a strainer (for wine) on Yom Tov, and one may put into a suspended strainer on Shabbat.  Chachamim say, one may not hang a strainer on Yom Tov, and one may not put into a suspended strainer on Shabbat, but one may put into a suspended (strainer) on Yom Tov.", 
        "One may put water in lees such that they will be clear, one may strain wine with scarves or an Egyptian basket, one may put an egg in a strainer of mustard (so the yolk will drip in and color it, and one may make enomlin (a mixture of wine, honey, and peppers) on Shabbat.  Rabi Yehuda says, on Shabbat a cup (of enomlin is all one is allowed to make, otherwise it is too much work), on Yom Tov by log, and on Chol Hamo’ed, by the barrel.  Rabi Tzadok says, it is all based on the (number of) guests.", 
        "One may not soak asafetida (an herb) in lukewarm water (a weekday activity) but he may put it in vinegar.  And one may not soak vetches or rub them, but he may put inside a sieve or a large basket.  One may not sift hay in a sieve and one may not put it in a high place such that the chaff will fall down, but he may put it in a sieve and put it into a stable.", 
        "One may sweep (a stable on Shabbat) before the fatting (bull, so that its food will be clean and will still want its food), and one may move (feed) to the sides because of animal droppings according to Rabi Dosa, and Chachamim prohibit it.  One may take (food) from this animal and put it before that animal on Shabbat.", 
        "Straw which is on a bed (used for warmth), one may not shake it with his hand, but he may shake it with his body (to smooth it), but if it’s the food of an animal or there was on it a pillow or sheet, one may shake it with his hand.  A household clothing one may open (to remove clothes) but not press, but those of launderers, one may not touch.  Rabi Yehuda says, if it was opened from before Shabbat, he may open it completely and remove (the clothes)."
