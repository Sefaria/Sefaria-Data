        "When is everyone allowed to take leket, i.e. when is it hefker?  When the slow, old, poor people leave (they are the last people to finish taking).  When can anyone take peret and olelet?  When the poor have come and gone twice.  What about olives?  After the second rain.  Rabi Yehuda said, aren’t there people who only harvest their olives after the second rain?  Rather, after the poor wouldn’t return with more than four issarot (a monetary amount).", 
        "We trust sellers when they say their produce is of the gifts (and therefore don’t need ma’aser) when it is in their time.  Levi’im are always trusted.  But they are only trusted by things people would usually give to them.", 
        "We believe them by wheat, but not by flour or bread.   By rice on the stalk, but not threshed, whether raw or cooked.  We trust them by beans, but not pounded beans, whether raw or cooked.  We trust them by oil that they say was given to them, but not by oil which they say they made from olives which were nikuf (odd and a gift for the poor).", 
        "we believe them by raw vegetables, but not by cooked, unless it’s only a little, because that an owner would give from his pot as a gift.", 
        "You don’t give from the threshing floor less than half a kav of wheat and a kav of barley.  Rabi Meir says half a kav.  A kav and a half of spelt, and a kav of dried figs, or a portion of pressed, dried figs (the way they are sold in the market).  Rabi Akiva says half a portion of figs. Half a lug of wine, Rabi Akiva says a quarter.  A revi’it of oil.  Rabi Akiva says, half of that.  And all other produce, Abba Shmu’el said, enough that he can sell it and buy two meals’ worth.", 
        "Those measurements apply to everyone.  If he wants to save some for poor relatives, he saves half and gives half to the poor who are here.  If he doesn’t have enough to fill the shiur, he gives the poor who are there what he has and they divide it equally.", 
        "For a poor person who travels around, you do not give a loaf worth less than pundyon, which can be calculated at half a kav.  If he stays overnight, you give him sheets too.  If he stays over Shabbat, you give him food for the three meals.  A person who has food for two meals may not take from the tamchuy, the plate of communal donations.  One who has for fourteen meals can not take from the kupa, money given out erev Shabbat.  The kupa is collected by two and distributed by three.", 
        "One who has 200 zuz cannot take gifts for the poor.  If he had 200 less a dinar, even if 1,000 people give him the gifts at once, he may take.  If some of the money was a collateral on a mortgage or his ktuba, he may take.  We don’t force him to sell his home or his fine utensils.", 
        "One who has fifty zuz and he uses them for trade may not take.  And one who takes even though they aren’t supposed to will die dependant on others.  And one who can take but does not will only die once he is supporting others, as we see in a pasuk, and the same goes for a judge who is true and righteous.  And all who aren’t lame in their legs or blind but makes himself out to be like one of them will die like one of them.  And likewise a judge who is corrupt will die in blindness, as we see a pasuk that says bribery blinds the sighted."
