        "Chazaka (taking ownership by making acts of possession for a certain length of time) on houses, holes, trenches, caves, dovecotes, bathhouses, olive presses, irrigated fields, slaves, and anything which makes common fruits (is continuously productive), their chazaka is three years from day to day (measured to the day).  A field which is not irrigated, its chazaka is three years, not day to day (three seasons is considered three years).  Rabi Yishma’el says, Three months in the first (year), thee months in the last (year), and twelve months in the middle (year, is sufficient for chazaka), behold eighteen months.  Rabi Akiva says, a month in the first, a month in the last, and twelve months in the middle, behold fourteen months.  Rabi Yishma’el said, what is this talking about?  In a white (grain) field, but in a field of trees, if he collected its produce, gathered its olives, and collected its figs, behold these are three years.", 
        "There are three lands (regions) for chazaka, Yehuda, Transjordan, and the Galil.  If he was in Yehuda and grasped (possession through chazaka) in the Galil, in the Galil and grasped in Yehuda, it is not chazaka, until it is with him in the region.  Rabi Yehuda said, they did not say three years other than so that it will be if he (the owner) is in Spain, one will grasp for a year, they will go and inform him for a year, and he will come back another (the next) year.", 
        "Any chazaka which does not have a claim with it is not a chazaka.  How?  If he (the owner) said to him, what are you doing in my (property)?  And he said to him, that a person never told me of this (that it was yours), it is not chazaka.  (If he responds,) that you sold it to me, you gave it to me as a gift, your father sold it to me, or your father gave it to me as a gift, behold this is chazaka.  And one who comes because of inheritance does not need a claim (for inheritance is his claim).  Artisans, partners, tenant farmers, and trustees do not have chazaka.  A man does not have chazaka by the property of his wife, not a woman in the property of her husband, not a father with the property of the son, nor the son with the property of the father.  What is this talking about?  With one who grasp, but when he gives as a gift, brothers who divide (something in their inheritance), one who grasps the property of a convert, and one who locked a gate and it broke any at all, behold this is chazaka.", 
        "If two (witnesses) were testifying that this one ate it (from a field) for three yeas and they were found to be zomemim, they pay him (the owner) all (the value of the field).  If two (testified) about the first (year), two about the second, and two on the third, (and they are found to be zomemim) they split (the entire cost) between them.  Three brothers (who are testifying) and one combines with them, behold these are three testimonies (for the brothers cannot testify together), but they are one testimony for becoming zomemim (they all have to be found as such for any of them to be punished).", 
        "These are things which have chazaka, and these are things which do not have chazaka, if he was working his animal in a courtyard, (he set up) an oven and a stove, millstones, a chicken coop, or he was putting his manure in the courtyard, this is not chazaka.  But, if he made a wall for a large animal that is ten tfachim (high), and so too for an oven, so too for a stove, so too for a mill, if he brought chickens into the house, or if he made a place for his manure deeper than three (tfachim) or taller than three, behold this is chazaka.", 
        "A gutter does not have chazaka (another person may move its downspout), but its place has chazaka (one cannot remove the gutter).  An Egyptian ladder (a type of small ladder) does not have chazaka (cause land it sits on to be owned by the owner of the ladder) but a Tzori (ladder) has chazaka (for it is large and attaches permanently).  An Egyptian window has no chazaka (over the land it sticks out onto), but a Tzori one does.  Which is an Egyptian window?  All which the head of a person cannot enter into it (from size restraints).  Rabi Yehuda says, if it has a frame, even if a person’s head cannot fit into it, this is chazaka.  A projection (from a wall into another person’s property) up to a tefach (and longer) has chazaka, and he (the owner of the land below) can protest.  Less than a tefach, it does not have chazaka, and he cannot protest.", 
        "A person may not open his window into the courtyard of partners (we do not want others to see into his house).  If he bought a house in a different (adjoining) courtyard, he may not open it (make its opening to the public domain) with the courtyard of partners.  If he built an upper room on top of his house, he may not open it to the courtyard of partners, rather if he wants (to build an upper room), he builds a room within his house, he builds an upper room on top of his house, and opens it into his house.  A person may not open into the courtyard of partners an opening facing an opening or a window facing a window.  If it was small (a window facing another window), he may not make it big.  (If it was) one, he may not make it two.  But, he may open into the public domain an opening opposite an opening and a window opposite a window.  If it was small, he may make it big; one, he may make it two.", 
        "One may not make a cavity under the public domain, holes, trenches, and caves.  Rabi Eliezer allows, (but it must be strong enough) that a wagon can go loaded with stones (and it will stand).  One may not put out projections or balconies to the public domain, but if he wanted (this structure) he enters (goes back further) into his (property) and puts out (such that it stays in his property).  If he bought a courtyard and there were projections and balconies in it, behold this is in his chazaka (he may keep them there)."
