        "A window between two courtyards, four by four (tfachim), within ten (tfachim of the ground) they make two eruvim, and if they want, they can make one.  If it’s less than four by four and above (the ground by more than) ten, they make two eruvim and not one.", 
        "A wall between two courtyards ten tall and four wide, they make two eruvim and not one.  If there was produce at the top, they may both go up and eat, as long as they don’t take it down.  If it is broken up to ten amot, they may make two eruvim or if they want one, since it is like an entrance.  If (the break is) more than this, they make one eruv and not two,", 
        "A furrow which is between two courtyards deeper than ten and wider than four (tfachim) they make two eruvim and not one, even if it is filled with stray or hay.  If it (the trench) is filled with earth or gravel, they make one eruv and not two.", 
        "If he put on a board which is wider than four tfachim, and so too (with) two balconies opposite each other they make two eruvim and if they want they make one.  If  (the board) is less than this, they make two eruvim and not one.", 
        "a pile of hay which is between two courtyards and taller than ten tfachim, they make two eruvim and not one, these feed from he and those from there (opposite sides for the two courtyards).  If it became less than ten tfachim, they make one eruv and not two eruvim.", 
        "How does one participate in a mavoy?  One rests a barrel and says, this is for all the people of the mavoy and he can give them (the other people) possession through his adult son or daughter, his Jewish slave or maidservant, and his wife, but not through his children who are minors or his Cana’ani slave or maidservant, since their hand is like his hand (it can’t be relinquished by them).", 
        "If the food became tame, he adds and gives over possession, and he doesn’t need to inform (the others).  If they (the number of people) increased, he adds and gives over possession, and has to inform them.", 
        "How much is the set measurement?  When they (the number of people) are many, food for two meals for everyone.  When they are few, a dried fig’s worth, for carrying on Shabbat, for each person.", 
        "Rabi Yossi said, what is this talking about?  For the beginning of an eruv, but for the leftovers of an eruv, any amount.  And they only said to make an eruv in courtyards so children should not forget (the concept of eruv).", 
        "One can make an eruv and participate with anything, except with water and with salt according to Rabi Eliezer.  Rabi Yehoshua says, a loaf is an eruv.  Even something baked with a se’ah (of flour) if sliced, one does not make an eruv with it.  A loaf made with an issar (of flour) which is whole, one may make an eruv with it."
