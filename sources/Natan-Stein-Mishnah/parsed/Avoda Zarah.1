        "Three days before the festivals of non-Jews, it is assur to but and sell with them, to lend them (things) and borrow from them, to lend them (money) or borrow from them, or the pay them back or to be paid back by them.  Rabi Yehuda says, one may collect payment from them because is distressing for him.  They said to him, even though it distresses him now, he will be happy after some time.", 
        "Rabi Yishma’el says, three days before them (non-Jewish festivals) and three days after them (everything above) is assur.  Chachamim say,, before their festivals is assur, after the festivals is mutar.", 
        "And these are the festivals of non-Jews, Calenda (calendar, a new month or year), Starnura (Saturn, the end of the year), Kratesim (Empire day, when Rome conquered Alexandria), the Coronation day of Kings, the day of birth (of the king), the day of death (of a king), according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, any death which has burning (a funeral pyre) has avoda zara (idolatry, making it a festival), any death which does not have burning, does not have avoda zara.  (There are also personal festivals, which a non-Jew makes on) a day when he shaves his beard and his locks, a day when he came up from the sea (got back from a foreign country), a day he left prison, and a non-Jew who made a (wedding) feast for his son, it is not assur except that day, and that person alone.", 
        "A city in which they did avoda zara, (conducting business) outside it is mutar.  If there was (a city where) outside it there was avoda zara, its inside is mutar.  What is it (is it permitted) to go in there (a city of avoda zara)?  When the path is special (only for) that place, it is assur, but if he can go on it to another place, it’s mutar.  A city which has avoda zara in it, if (on the day of a festival) there are decorated shops and undecorated ones, this was a case in beit She’an, and the Chachamim said, the decorated (shops) are assur, but those which aren’t decorated are mutar.", 
        "These things (which are used for avoda zara) are assur to sell to a non-Jew, the fruit of cedars, white figs and their stems, frankincense, and a white chicken (rooster).  Rabi Yehuda says, he may sell a white one among (other) chickens. And when it is (being sold) alone, he cuts off a finger and sells to him, because they do not offer something missing (a part) to avoda zara.  And all other things, if (he sold it) without specifying (an intended purpose), they are mutar (to sell), but specified (for use of avoda zara), it is assur.  Rabi Meir says, even good palm (fruit, dates), sugar cane, and fine herbs are assur to sell to non-Jews.", 
        "In a place where it was the custom to (allow people to) sell a thin animal (sheep) to non-Jews, that may sell, in a place where they had a custom not to sell, one may not sell.  And in all places one does not sell a large animal (cattle) to them, calves and foals, whole (unblemished) or broken (injured).  Rabi Yehuda allows by a broken one, and Ben Bteira allows by a horse.", 
        "One may not sell them bears and lions or anything which can damage the public.  One does not build with them a basilica (used as a courthouse), a scaffold (for gallows), a stadium (such as for gladiators), or a stage (pulpit), but one may build with them a public bathhouse or a bathhouses.  Once they reach the dome where they stand the idol (in the bathhouse), it is assur for build.", 
        "And one may not make jewelry for avoda zara, necklaces, nose rings, and rings.  Rabi Eliezer says, for money it is mutar.  One may not sell them (produce) which is attached to land (for one may not let them settle in Israel, and something attached to the soil is like the soil), but he may sell to him once it is cut.  Rabi Yehuda says, he may sell him (attached produce) in order for him to cut it.  One may not lease them houses in the land of Israel, and there is no need to say (one may not lease them) fields (for it is obvious).  In Syria one may lease them houses, but not fields, and outside of Israel on may sell them houses and lease them fields, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, in the land of Israel they lease them houses but not fields, in Syria one sells them houses and leases them fields, and outside the land (of Israel) one may sell them this and that (either).", 
        "Even in a place where they said (one may) lease, they did not refer to a place to live (they were allowing rental of a storehouse or the like), because (if he leases a house) he is bringing avoda zara into it, as it says, “and you shall not being an abomination (avoda zara) to your house.”  And in every place he may not lease him a bathhouse, because it is called on its name (they name bathhouses after idols)."
