        "Three times a year would they withdraw from the chamber, half a month before Pesach, half a month before Shavuot, and half a month before Sukkot.  And these are the times we gather ma’aser behema, according to Rabi Akiva.  Ben Azay says, the twenty-ninth of Adar, the first of Sivan, and the twenty-ninth of Av.  Rabi Eliezer and Rabi Shimon say, the first of Nisan, the first of Sivan, and the twenty-ninth of Elul.  Why do they say the twenty-ninth of Elul and not the first of Tishray?  Because it’s yom tov, and you can’t take ma’aser on yom tov, therefore, they made it earlier to the twenty-ninth of Elul.", 
        "Three chests of three se’ah each are withdrawn from the chamber, and on them is an aleph, bet, and gimmel.  Rabi Yishma’el says, it was written in Greek, alpha, beta, and gamma.  The withdrawer may not enter with a hemmed garment, shoes, sandals, tfillin, or an amulet, lest he become poor and people will say, he was getting rich by the donations in the chamber, since a person needs to please people the same way he pleases Hashem, as it says, “and you shall be clean from Hashem and Yisra’el,” and” and find favor and good thoughts in the eyes of Hashem and man.”", 
        "(Members) of the house of Raban Gamliel would enter with their shekel between their fingers, and they would throw them before the withdrawer of funds, and he would push it into the chest.  The one withdrawing would not withdraw until he told them, “I will withdraw,” and they would say to him, “withdraw, withdraw, withdraw,” three times.", 
        "He made the first withdrawal and he covered (the shkalim) with leather covers (as a divider for the new shekels which would come later) and second and covered with leather covers.  The third time he doesn’t put them, lest he forget and he’ll withdraw from money from which a withdrawal has been made.  He withdrew the first in the name of Israel, the second because of the cities encircling it, and the third because of Bavel, Madai, and far off countries."
