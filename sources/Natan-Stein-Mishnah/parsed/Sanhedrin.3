        "Monetary matters by three, each party chooses a judge, and they choose the third together, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say the two judges choose the third.  One party can invalidate the judge of the other according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, when is this so?  When we bring proof that they are relatives or pasul.  But if they are kosher or an expert, you can’t make them pasul.  One can invalidate the other’s witnesses, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, when is this?  When they can prove that they are pasul or a relative, but if they are kosher, they may testify.", 
        "One said to the other, I trust my father and you father (as the judges), or that these three random herdsmen are our judges, Rabi Meir allows you to recant.  Chachamim say you can’t.  If one person had to make an oath, and he said swear to me on your life (so that we would believe him), Rabi Meir says he can go back.  Chachamim say you can’t.", 
        "These gamblers, usurers, pigeon stealers, and those who sell shmitta produce.  Rabi Shimon said, they used to call them those who collect shmitta produce, but when the tax collectors demanded produce, they made is to vendors again.  Rabi Yehuda says, when is this?  When they have no craft other than this, but if they do, they are kosher.", 
        "These his father, his brother, his blood uncle, his brother-in-law, his uncle by marriage, his stepfather, his father-in-law, and his wife’s brother, them their sons, their sons-in-law, and his wife’s son from another husband.  Rabi Yossi said, this was taught according to Rabi Akiva.  Before Rabi Akiva, it was taught that the relatives were, his uncle, his cousin, and all who could inherit from him.  All his relatives at that time, if he stopped being a relative, he is a kosher witness.  Rabi Yehuda says, if his daughter dies, her sons are still his relatives.", 
        "His friend and his enemy.  His friend is one who gave him a wedding gift, and his enemy is one who hasn’t spoken to him in three days out of anger.  Chachamim said to Rabi Yehuda, we don’t suspect Jews of being this way.", 
        " ", 
        "How do you check witnesses?  They would bring them in and intimidate them, remove everyone except the greatest among them, and say to him, how do you know this is liable for this?  If he brings hearsay evidence, it’s as if he said nothing, unless he says that the defendant admitted his debt to the plaintiff in the witness’s presence.  After this, they bring in the second and check him.  If their statements are consistent, they discuss the matter.  If two judges agree, the ruling is in their favor.  But, if one judge says he can’t decide, they add more judges and re-assess.", 
        "They finished discussing and called the parties in.  The greatest of the judges gives the verdict.  And how do we know that a judge can’t comment on that he disagreed with his colleagues?  From psukim against rechilut.", 
        "Whenever a party brings new proof, he may dismantle the verdict.  They said to him, bring all proofs you have by then end of thirty days.  If he found it in the thirty days, he dismantles, if it was after the allotted time, the judgment stands.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what should a person do if he didn’t find in the thirty days, but found afterwards?  They said to him, bring witnesses, and he said, I have none.  They said to him, bring proof, and he said, I have none.  After some time he finds proof or witnesses, but it’s worthless.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what does a person do who didn’t know there were witnesses, but there were witnesses?  Or didn’t know he had proof, but found proof?  They said to him, do you have proof or witnesses and he said no, so when he saw he was going to lose, he took two random people as witnesses, or pulled some forged proof out of his girdle, so we don’t believe it."
