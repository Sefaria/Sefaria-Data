        "All spittle found in Yerushalayim is (considered to be) tahor, except for that of the upper shul according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, on the other days of the year (not holiday) that in the middle (of the street) is tahor and that at the sides (where tahor people walk to stay tahor) is tahor.  And during the times of the holidays, that in the middle is tahor and that one the sides is tame, because they (the tame) are a minority and remove themselves to the sides.", 
        "All utensils which are found in Yerushalayim on the way down to the place of immersing are tame, on the way up, are tahor, for the way down is not the way up according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, they are all tahor, except the basket, spade, and a crusher designated for graves (people used to be buried and after a certain amount of time their bones would be transferred to a family plot, and these tools were used in the process of adding to and maintaining the family plot).", 
        "A knife which was found on the fourteenth (of Nisan), one may slaughter with it immediately.  If on the thirteenth, he immerses it again.  A cleaver (not used for slaughtering but rather chopping meat), in either case he immerses it again.  If the fourteenth fell out on a Shabbat (and he found even a cleaver), he may slaughter with it immediately (for one may not immerse on Shabbat, so we assume the owner immersed it on Friday).  On the fifteenth, he may slaughter with it immediately.  If it (a cleaver) was found tied to a knife, behold, it is like a knife.", 
        "A curtain which became tame from a contaminated object, they immerse it within (in the mikva in the courtyard of the Beit Hamikdash), and they bring it in immediately.  One which became tame from the source of tuma, they immerse it outside and lay it out in the chel (an area in the Beit Hamikdash between the soreg, a partition, and the wall of the women’s courtyard).  If it was new, they spread it on the roof of a portico so that the nation will see its work which is beautiful.", 
        "Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabi Shimon ben haSgan, the curtain was one tefach thick; was woven of seventy-two strands, with each thread (containing) twenty-four threads; it was forty amot long; it was twenty amot wide; it was made from eighty-two ribo (either ten thousand, referring to either the number of the number of threads or the value, or girls employed in its manufacturing); they would make two every year; and three hundred kohanim would immerse it.", 
        "The meat of the most holy which became tame, whether from a source of tuma or a contaminated object, whether inside or outside (the courtyard), Beit Shamay says, it must all be burnt inside, except what was made tame from a source of tuma outside.  Beit Hillel says, everything is burnt outside, except for what was made tame from a contaminated object inside.", 
        "Rabi Eliezer says, if it became tame from a source of tuma whether inside or outside it is burned outside, and if it became tame from a contaminated object, whether inside or outside, it is burned inside.  Rabi Akiva says, the place where it became tame is the place it is burned.", 
        "The limbs of a tamid are placed on the lower half of the ramp to the east (the tamid was not brought up all in one trip, so this is where it was left), of musaf is placed on the lower half of the ramp to the west, and of Rosh Chodesh were placed on the karkov (walkway between the corners for the kohanim) of the mizbe’ach above.  Shkalim and bikurim aren’t done unless there is a Beit Hamikdash, but ma’aser on grain, ma’aser on animals, and firstborn (animals) are done when there is a Beit Hamikdash and when there isn’t a Beit Hamikdash.  One who makes shkalim and bikurim hekdesh, behold they are hekdesh.  Rabi Shimon says, one who says his bikurim are kodesh, they aren’t kodesh."
