        "Withdrawn funds, what did they do with it?  They buy korban tamid, korban musaf, the libations, the omer, two breads, showbreads, and all public offerings.  Those who guard the aftergrowth in shvi’it (to make sure people aren’t using properly), their salary comes out of public funds.  Rabi Yossi says, even one who wants can volunteer and do it for free.  They said to him, even you say that they only come for the community.", 
        "The (red) heifer, the sent away goat, and the strip of red wool (for the para aduma) come from the withdrawal from the chamber.  The ramp built for a red heifer , a ramp built for the sent away goat, the thread between his horns (of the goat), the water canal (in the courtyard), the city wall and its towers, and all the needs of the city come from the leftovers of the chamber.  Abba Shaul says, the ramp for the red heifer, the large kohanim build it themselves.", 
        "Extra leftovers from the chamber, what would they do with it?  They would buy wine, oil, fine flour (to resell for those who needed for service), and the profit was for the Beit Hamikdash, according to Rabi Yishma’el.  Rabi Akiva says, one may not profit from hekdesh of the poor.", 
        "Extra truma, what would they do with it?  Gold sheets for covering for the kodesh kadashim.  Rabi Yishma’el says, extra fruits for the altar’s ‘dessert’ (extra korbanot) and extra truma for the vessels of service.  Rabi Akiva says, extra truma is for the altar’s ‘dessert’ and the extra libations are used for the vessels of service.  Rabi Chanina sgan of the kohanim says, the extra libations are for the altar’s ‘dessert’ and the extra truma is for the vessels of service.  Neither one nor the other admitted about the fruits.", 
        "Extra incense, what did they do with it?  They take from it (communal money) wages of the artisans, redeem (the extra) on the wages of the artisans, and they give it to the artisans with their salary, and they return and buy more with the new donations.  If the new came on time, they buy from the new, and if not, from the old.", 
        "One who dedicates his possessions and there is something fit for the public korban (as in spices), they are given to the artisans as part of their salary according to Rabi Akiva.  Ben Azay said to him, this is not the method, rather they take from them the wages of the artisans, they redeem them on the money of the artisans, they give them as part of the artisan’s salary, and they return and buy from the new donations.", 
        "One who dedicates his possessions and there is in them an animal fit for the altar male and female, Rabi Eliezer says, the males are sold for the needs of olot, and the females are sold for the needs of shlamim, and their  proceeds will fall in with the rest for the upkeep of the Beit Hamikdash.  Rabi Yehoshua says, the males themselves will be olot, and the females will be sold for the needs of shlamim, and their money will be for olot, and the rest of his possessions will fall in for the upkeep of the Beit Hamikdash.  Rabi Akiva says, I agree with the words of Rabi Eliezer more than with those of Rabi Yehoshua, for Rabi Eliezer was consistent in his method and Rabi Yehoshua divides his.  Rabi Papyas said, I agree with both of them, Rabi Eliezer for when he dedicates specifically (for the upkeep) and Rabi Yehoshua for when he doesn’t specify.", 
        "One who dedicates objects and there were in them things fit for (offering) on the altar, wines, oils, and fowl, Rabi Elazar says, they should be sold for the needs of those kinds (to buy new ones) and the proceeds should go for olot, and the rest of the objects will fall in with the upkeep of the Beit Hamikdash.", 
        "Once every thirty days prices are set for the chamber.  Anyone who accepts upon himself to supply fine flour at four (se’ah to the sela) and the price stood at three, he must supply four, if it was at three and it stood at four, he must supply four, for hekdesh is given the upper hand.  And if fine flour became wormy, the wormy is for him, and if wine turned, it turned for him.  And he doesn’t get his money until the altar accepts it (if a product spoils before being used, the supplier loses that value)."
