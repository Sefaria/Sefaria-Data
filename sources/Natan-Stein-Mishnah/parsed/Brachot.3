        "A person who lost someone is exempt from kriyat shma, shmone esrey, and tfillin.  Those who carry the coffin are also.  Those who won’t carry are chayav, but they all have an exemption from kriyat shma.", 
        "If they have time to say it before they have to make the line of menachim, they should start.  The inner are patur but the outer are chayav.", 
        "Women, slaves, and minors are patur in kriyat shma and tfillin, but chayav in shmone esrey, mezuzah, and birkat hamazon.", 
        "A bal keri reads birkot kriyat shma to himself, not aloud.  He says bracha achrona, but not rishona (on food).  Rabi Yehuda says you do both.", 
        "Hay. One remembers he’s a bal keri during kriyat shma, cut short.  If you have time for mikva, do.  If not, cover yourself in water – but not gross or laundry water.  One should be four amot from poop.", 
        "A zav who became bal keri, a nida who discharged semen, and an active woman who becomes nida need mikva and Rabi Yehuda says it’s not chayav."
