        "Ben Zoma says, who is a wise person?  One who learns from all people, as it says, “from all of my teachers I have understood.”  Who is mighty?  One who conquers his will, as it says, “one who is slow to anger is better than a hero and one who rules his spirit from one who captures a city.”  Who is rich?  One who is happy with his portion as it says, “what comes to your hands when you eat it will make you happy and will be good for you.”  “Will make you happy,” in this world, “and will be good for you,” for the world to come.  Who is honored?  The one who honors the creations, as it says, “for those who honor me I will honor and those who have disdain for me will be regarded in levity.”", 
        "Ben Azay says, run to an easy mitzva the same as a strict one, and flee from sin, for a mitzva causes a mitzva and a sin causes a sin, for the reward of a mitzva is a mitzva and the reward of a sin is a sin.", 
        "He used to say, do not have disdain for any man, and do not argue on every thing, for there is no person who does not have a time and there is no thing which does not have its place.", 
        "Rabi Levitas a man from Yavne says, be very very humble, for the hope of man is but a worm (all people are destined to the grave).  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka says, all who desecrate the name of heaven in private, his punishment is in the open.  Whether accidentally or intentionally when it comes to disgracing Hashem.", 
        "Rabi Yishma’el his son says, one who learns in order to teach, they make him able to learn and teach.  And one who learns in order to do, they make him able to learn, teach, keep (mitzvot), and do.  Rabi Tzadok says, do not make them a crown to become great through them or a spade to dig with it (to benefit from it as a living).  And Hillel would say like this, all who use the crown perish, from hear you learn, all who benefit from the word of torah removes his life from the world.", 
        "Rabi Yossi says, all who honor the torah, he himself is honored above the creations, and all who disrespect the torah, he himself is disrespected by the creations.", 
        "Rabi Yishma’el his son says, one who hides himself from (passing) judgment separates himself from hatred, theft, and vain oaths.  One who makes his heart in the thick of legal decisions, is foolish, wicked, and haughty.", 
        "He used to say, do not judge alone, for only One (Hashem) can judge alone.  And do not say, accept my opinion!  For they decide and not you.", 
        "Rabi Yonatan says, all who fulfill the torah while poor will in the end fulfill it rich.  And all who neglect the torah while rich in the end will neglect it while poor.", 
        "Rabi Meir says, diminish in business and engage in torah, and be humble before everyone, and if you neglect from the torah, you will have many idlers as your counterparts, and if you work on torah, He has much reward to give you.", 
        "Yud Rabi Elazar ben Ya’akov says, one who does one mitzva acquires himself one advocate, and the one who transgresses one transgression acquires for himself one prosecutor.  Repentance and good deeds are a shield against punishment.  Rabi Yochanan the sandalmaker says, all assembly which is for the sake of Heaven its end is to last, and that which is not for the sake of Heaven, it’s end is not to last.", 
        "Yud Rabi Eliezer ben Shamu’a says, let the honor of your student be beloved by you like your own, and the honor of your friend, like the awe for your master, and the awe for your master, like your awe for Heaven.", 
        "Yud Rabi Yehuda says, be careful in learning, for an error in learning goes up as an intentional (transgression).  Rabi Shimon says, there are three crowns, the crown of torah, the crown of kehuna, and the crown of kingship, and the crown of a good name (reputation) goes above them all.", 
        "Yud Rabi Nehoray says, be exiled to a place of torah, and do not say that it will come after you, or your friend will make it last in your hand, and do not rely on your understanding.", 
        "Tet Rabi Yanay says, it is not in our hands (to explain) neither the peace of the wicked nor the suffering of the righteous.  Rabi Matya ben Charash says, be early to greet every person, be a tail for lions (associate with great people though they will outshine you), and do not be a head for foxes (to associate with lower people though you can be head over them).", 
        "Tet Rabi Ya’akov says, this world is like a entry room before the world to come, fix yourself up in the entry room so that you can enter the banquet hall.", 
        "Yud He used to say, one hour of repentance and good deeds in this world is better than all of the world to come, and one hour of bliss in the world to come is better than all of this world.", 
        "Yud Rabi Shimon ben Elazar says, do not appease your friend when he is angry, do not console him when his dead lies before him, do not question him (about loopholes and motives) when he makes a vow, and do not try to see the time of his mistakes.", 
        "Yud Shmu’el Hakatan says, “in the downfall of your enemies do not be happy and in his stumbling let your heart not be glad, lest Hashem sees and it is bad in His eyes and He will return from upon him His wrath.”", 
        "Elisha ben Avuya says, one who learns as a child, what is he like?  Like ink written on new paper.  One who learns as an old person, what is he like?  Like ink written on blotted (reused) paper (where the letters are not as clear and can be rubbed of more easily).  Rabi Yossi bar Yehuda a man of the Bavli village says, one who learns from children, what is he like?  Like one who eats unripe grapes and drinks wine (unfinished) from the winepress.  One who learns from old people, what is he like?  Like one who eats ripe grapes and drinks aged wine.  Rabi says, do not look at the jar, but rather what is in it, there are new jars filled with old (wine) and old (jars) that even new (wine, grape juice) it doesn’t have in it.", 
        "Kaf Rabi Eliezer Hakapar says, jealousy, desire, and (desire for) gravity remove a man from this world.", 
        "Kaf He used to say, the born (are destined) to die, the dead to live, the living to be judged, to know, to inform, and to assure that he is God, He is the Former, He is the Creator, He understands, He is the judge, He is a witness, He is a legal party, and He will judge.  Blessed is He, for before Him there is no cheating, no forgetting, no favoring, and no bribing, for everything is His.  And know, that everything is according to calculation.  And let your (evil) will not be your ensurer that hell will be your refuge, for against your will your were created, against your will you were born, against your will you live, against your will you die, and against your will you will stand for judgment and calculation before the King, the King of Kings the Holy one blessed be He."
