        "Three times in the year the kohanim raise their hands four time in on day, at shacharit, musaf, mincha, and the locking of the gate (either in the Beit hamikdash or Heaven, depending on the day, and the times are) on fasts, the ma’amadot (yisra’elim who were appointed to stand as representatives when the public offerings were being given), and on Yom Hakippurim.", 
        "Which are the ma’amadot?  Since it says, “command Bnei Yisra’el and you shall say to them my offering my bread,” and so how can the offering of a person be brought and he is not standing beside it?  The early nevi’im established twenty-four watches, and on each watch there was a troop in Yerushalayim of kohanim, of levi’im, and of yisra’elim.  It came time for the troop to go up, the kohanim and the levi’im go up to Yerushalayim, and the Yisra’elim which are in that watch gather in their towns and read from (the portion of) the acts of creation.", 
        "And the people of the watch would fast four days of the week, from Monday until Thursday, and they would not fast erev Shabbat because of honor for Shabbat.  And not on Sunday, such that they do not go out from rest and enjoyment to pain and fasting.  (This is what they would read each day,) on the first day, “at first,” and, “let there be a firmament.”  On the second, “let there be a firmament,” and, “let the waters gather.”  On the third, “let the waters gather,” and, “let there be luminaries.”  On the fourth, “let there be luminaries,” and, “let the waters writhe.”  On the fifth, “let the waters writhe,” and, “let the land produce.”  On the sixth, “let the land produce,” and, “and the heavens were finished.”  A large section, they would read it as two (people), and a small one, in one, in shacharit and mincha.  And at mincha they enter and read by heart, like one reads the shma.  Erev Shabbat at mincha they would no enter, out of honor of the Shabbat.", 
        "Every day which has Hallel, it has no (reading by the people of the) ma’amad at shacharit.  (If there is) a musaf offering, there is no ne’ila.  A wood offering (some people would donate wood for a specific day), there is no mincha, according to Rabi Akiva.  Ben Azay said to him, Rabi Yehoshua used to teach like this, a musaf offering, this is no mincha.  A wood offering, there is no ne’ila.  Rabi Akiva returned and taught like Ben Azay.", 
        "The times the kohanim and the people would bring wood were nine.  On the first of Nisan, the children of Arach ben Yehuda; on the seventeenth of Tamuz, the children of David ben Yehuda; on the fifth of Av, the children of Parosh ben Yehuda; on the seventh of it (Av), the children of Yonadav ben Rechev; on the tenth of it, the children on Sna’ah ben Binyamin; on the fifteenth of it, the children of Zatu ben Yehuda; and with them kohanim, levi’im, anyone who mistook (didn’t know for sure) his tribe, and the sons of those who deceived with pestles and the children of the packers of dried figs (when there was a decree against bringing bikurim people hid their bikurim by pretending they were going to press fig cakes).  On the twentieth of it, the children of Pachat Mo’av ben Yehuda; on the twentieth of Elul, the children of Adin ben Yehuda; and on the first of Tevet, the children of Parosh returned a second time.  On the first of Tevet there was no ma’amad, for there was on it Hallel, a musaf offering, and a wood offering.", 
        "Five things happened to out forefathers on the seventeenth of Tamuz and five on Tisha B’Av.  On the seventeenth of Tamuz the luchot were broken, the tamid (offering) was stopped, the city (of Yerushalayim) was breached, Apostmos burned the torah, and he placed an idol in the sanctuary.  On Tisha B’Av it was decreed on our forefathers (in the desert) that they wouldn’t enter the land (of Israel), the first and second Beit Hamikdash were destroyed, Betar was taken, and the city (Yerushalayim) was plowed over.  When Av comes in, they reduce in happiness.", 
        "The week in which Tisha B’Av falls, one is forbidden from getting a haircut and washing clothes, but on Thursday, on is permitted in honor of Shabbat.  On erev Tisha B’Av a person does not eat two (cooked) dishes, eat meat, or drink wine.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, he should change (his habits, i.e. if he normally drinks two cups of wine, he should drink one).  Rabi Yehuda obligates one to upturn the bed, and the Chachamim did not agree with him.", 
        "Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, there are no holidays for Yisra’el like the fifteenth of Av (explained below) and Yom Hakippurim (on which one’s sins are forgiven).  For on them the girls of Yerushalayim would go out in borrowed white clothing, so as not to embarrass one doesn’t have, and all of the clothing must be immersed.  And the girls of Yerushalayim would go out and dance in vineyards.  And what would they say?  Man, raise up your eyes and see what you choose for yourself.  Do not focus your eyes on beauty, focus your eyes on a good family, (as it says,) “a lie is grace and useless is beauty, a woman who fears Hashem she will be praised,” and it says, “give her from the fruits of her hands and praise her for her work in her gates.”  And like this he says, “go out and see the girls of Tzion with the king Shlomo (a metaphor for Hashem in this case) with the crown which his mother crowned her on the day of their wedding and on the day of the gladness of his heart.”  The day of his marriage, this is the giving of the torah, and on the day of the gladness of his heart, this is the building of the Beit Hamikdash that will be build quickly in our time, amen."
