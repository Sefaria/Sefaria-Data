        "One may set boards around a well (to make it like a private domain) four double boards (at a right angle) which are similar to eight (they are placed at the corners of a square around a well, with a space between each one, creating an entrance on each side) or eight which seem like twelve, four double boards and four singles (two entrances on each side, the large entrance divided by a single board).  Their height must be ten tfachim, their width is six (tfachim), their width is any amount, and between them the space of two teams of three oxen each according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, of four (oxen) each, tied and not untied, one can go in and one can leave.", 
        "One may bring (boards) close to the well, as long as the head and most of (the body of) a cow can be inside and it can drink.  One may move it out until any amount, as long as he increases the number of boards.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda says, until (the enclosed area) is the size of two beit se’ah.  They said to him, two beit se’ah is only said by a garden or a closed in are used for storage, but if it was a pen used while animals fertilize, an enclosure, a backyard, or a courtyard, even if it is the size of five kur (a total of 150 se’ah), and even ten kur is mutar.  And one is even permitted to move it out any amount, as long as he increases the number of boards.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda says, if a public road separates them, he should divert it to the side (outside the boards).  Chachamim say, he doesn’t have to.  Whether a public pit, a public well, or a private well, the boards may be made around it.  But for a private pit, one makes a divider around it ten tfachim high according to Rabi Akiva.  Rabi Yehuda ben Bava says, one only makes board around the public well, and for the rest, one makes an enclosure ten tfachim high.", 
        "And furthermore said Rabi Yehuda ben Bava, a garden and closed storage area which are seventy amot and a bit by seventy amot and a bit (making it 5,000 square amot or two beit se’ah) surrounded by a fence taller than ten tfachim, one may carry in it provided there is a guard shack or a dwelling, or it is close to a city.  Rabi Yehuda says, even if all it has is a pit, a cistern, or a cave one may carry in it.  Rabi Akiva says, even if it has none of these, one may carry in it, as long as it is seventy amot and a bit by seventy amot and a bit.  Rabi Eliezer says, if its length is longer than its width by even an amah, one may not carry inside.  Rabi Yosef says, even if its length is twice as long is its width, one may carry in it.", 
        "Rabi Elay said, I heard from Rabi Eliezer, even if it is the size of a kur (thirty se’ah).  And I also herd from him, people of a courtyard, and one of them forgot and didn’t make an eruv, his house is assur to enter and exit for him, but for the others it’s mutar.  And I also heard from him that one is yotze with akravanim (a plant) on Pesach (for maror).  And I went back to all of his students and I asked for a colleague (to confirm my statements) and I didn’t find one."
