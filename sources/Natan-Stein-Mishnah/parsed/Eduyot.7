And the Chachamim say, they are not responsible for it, rather it is like the redeeming of ma’aser sheni.",

Rabi Papis testified on one who made two nazir vows, for if he shaves for the first on the thirtieth day (he would shave on the thirtieth day to end his first nezirut) that he shave the second on the sixtieth day, and if on the fifty-ninth day, he’s yotze, for the thirtieth day is counted in the number (of the second nezirut).", 
        "Rabi Yehoshua and Rabi Papis testified about a child of a shlamim is brought as a shlamim, for Rabi Eliezer says that the child of a shlamim is not brought as a shlamim.

They testified that they could make the year a leap year conditionally (without the approval of the head of the Sanhedrin if he isn’t there, which he can then nullify).  And there was a case with Raban Gamliel who went to get permission from the governor in Syria and he was delayed in coming, and the make the year a leap year conditionally, if Raban Gamliel wanted.  And when he came he said, I want, and they found the year was a leap year.",

And if she died, her husband inherits her.  And (he testified) about a stolen beam which is built into the palace, that he (the thief) must give its value (and not the beam itself), and about a stolen chatat (a stolen animal used for a chatat), that the public is unaware of, that it does atone, because of the sake of the mizbe’ach (so people are not over-careful when bringing korbanot)."
