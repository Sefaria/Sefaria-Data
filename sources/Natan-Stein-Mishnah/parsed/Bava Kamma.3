        "One who puts down a jug in the public domain, and another comes and stumbles on it and breaks it, he is patur (for the owner was negligent in leaving it there).  And if he was damaged by it, the owner of the barrel is chayav for his damage.  If his jug broke in the public domain and one slipped on the water (that was in the jug), or he was struck by its shards, he (the owner) is chayav (to pay for the damage).  Rabi Yehuda says, if he intended (to keep the broken pieces or collect the water, it is still his and is like a pit) he is chayav, but if he does not intend, he is patur.", 
        "One who pours water in the public domain, and one was damaged from them, he (the owner) is chayav for his damage.  One who conceals a thorn or glass, fences his fence with thorns, or a fence which fell into the public domain, and others were injured by them, he is chayav for their damage.", 
        "One who takes out his hay and straw to the public domain to manure them (make them into fertilizer), and another was damaged by them, he is chayav for his damage, and whoever comes first to them merits to take them (as a fine for endangering others).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, whoever deteriorates (leaves dung to become usable for fertilizing) in the public domain, and they damaged, they (the owners) are chayav to pay, and whoever comes first to them merits.  One who turns over dung into the public domain (to make an act of acquisition) and another was damaged by them, he is chayav for his damages.", 
        "Two potters who were walking one after another, the first stumbled and fell, and the second fell on the first, the firs is chayav in the damages of the second.", 
        "If this one (a person) came with his barrel, and that one (another person) came with his board, (they collided) and this one’s jug broke from the board of that one, he (the one with the board) is patur, for this one had a right to walk (there) and that one had a right to walk.  If the owner of the board was first and the owner of the barrel last (and they collided) and the barrel broke from the board, the owner of the board is patur, if the owner of the board stood (still, causing the owner of the barrel to bump into him), he’s chayav, but if the owner of the barrel said, stand (still), he’s patur.  If the owner of the barrel was first and the owner of the board was last, if the barrel broke on the board, he’s chayav, if the owner of the barrel stood, he’s patur, but if he said to the owner of the board, stand, he’s chayav.  And the same if this one comes with his (lighted) candle and that one comes with his flax (which burnt).", 
        "Two (people) who were walking in the public domain, one running and one walking or both running, and they damaged each other, they are both patur.", 
        "One who splits wood in a private domain and damaged (someone) in the public domain, (split wood) in the public domain and damages in a private domain, in a private domain and damaged in another private domain, (the one cutting wood) is chayav.", 
        "Two tam oxen who wounded each other they pay half the excess of the damage (the one whose ox caused more damage pays half of the difference in damages).  If they are both mu’ad, they pay the full excess damage.  If one is tam and one ismu’ad, the (if the) mu’ad (caused more damage) to the tam, he pays the full excess damage, the tam to the mu’ad, he pays half the excess damage.  And so too two people who wounded each other, they pay the full excess damage.  A person and a mu’ad (ox) or a mu’ad and a person, he pays the full excess damage.  A person and a tam or a tam and a person, a person to a tam he pays the full excess damage, but a tam to a person he pays half the excess damage.  Rabi Akiva, also a tam who wounded a person, he pays the full excess damage.", 
        "An ox worth a maneh (one hundred zuz) which gored an ox worth two hundred (zuz), and the carcass is worthless, he (the one damaged) takes the ox.  An ox worth two hundred which gored an ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worthless, Rabi Meir said, on this it was said, “and they shall sell the living ox and split its money.”  Rabi Yehuda said to him, and the halacha is like that, (but) you have upheld, “and they shall sell the living ox and split its money,” but you have not upheld, “and also the dead (ox) they shall split.”  And which (is the case which upholds both)?  This is an ox worth two hundred which gored an ox worth two hundred and the carcass is worth fifty zuz (the hide etc.), that this one takes half the (value of the) living and half the (value of) the dead, and that takes half the living and half the dead.", 
        "There is (a case where one is) chayav for the action of his ox and patur from his own action, or patur from the action of his ox and chayav for his action.  If his ox embarrassed (someone) he’s patur, but if he embarrassed, he is chayav.  If his ox blided the eye of his slave or knocked out his tooth, he is patur, but if he blinded the eye of his slave or knocked out his tooth, he’s chayav.  If his ox wounded his father or mother, he is chayav, but if he wounded his father or mother, he’s patur (since he incurs strangulation).  If his ox lit a pile of grain on Shabbat, he is chayav, but if he lit a stack of grain on Shabbat, he’s patur because he makes himself liable (to be punished) with his life (stoning for breaking Shabbat).", 
        "Yud An ox which was chasing after another ox and was damaged (injured), this one says, your ox damaged, and this one says, not so, rather a rock hurt, the one who removes from his friend, upon him is the (burden of) proof.  If two (oxen) were chasing after one, this one (owner of one of the chasing oxen) says, your ox (the other one chasing) damaged (the ox being chased) and that one (the owner of the other chasing ox) says, your ox (owned by the first talker) damaged, they are both patur (because it is not known which one damaged).  If they both belonged to one person, they are both chayav (in a case where both are tam, the owner will only have to pay half of the lesser one, but the damages may be collected from either ox).  If one was large and one was small, the damaged says, the large one damaged, and the damager says, not so, rather the small one damaged or one was tam and on was mu’ad, and the damaged says, the mu’ad damaged, and the damager says, not so, rather the tam damaged, the one who removes from his friend, upon him is the proof.  If the damaged were two, one large and one small, and the damagers were two, one large and one small, the damaged says, the large damaged the large and the small damaged the small, and the damager says, not so, rather the small damaged the large and the large damaged the small, or one tam and one mu’ad, and the damaged says, the mu’ad damaged the large and the tam damaged the small, and the damager says, not so, rather the tam (damaged) the large and the mu’ad the small, the one who removes from his friend, upon him is the proof."
