        "A judge-imposed oath, if the claim is (at least) two silver (ma’ah) and the admission is worth a pruta, if the admission isn’t in kind with the claim he’s patur.  How (is this)?  (If he claims) you have two silver of mine, (and he says) I only have a pruta of yours, he’s patur.  (If he claims) you have two silver and a pruta of mine, (and he says) I only have a pruta of yours, he’s chayav.  You have a maneh of mine, I don’t have of yours, he’s patur.  You have a maneh of mine, I only have fifty dinar of yours, he’s chayav.  You have a maneh of my father, I only have fifty dinar of his, he’s patur, for he is like one returning lost property.", 
        "You have a maneh of mine, if he said in front of witnesses, yes, and the next day he said, give it to me, and he said, I gave it to you, he’s patur.  (If he said) you don’t have anything in my hand, he’s chayav.  You have a maneh of mine, he said to him, yes (and he responded), do not give it to me except before witnesses, the next day he said to him, give it to me, I have given it to you, he’s chayav, for he should have given before witnesses.", 
        "You have a litra of gold of mine, you only have in my hands a litra of silver, he’s patur.  You have a golden dinar of mine, you only have in my hands a silver dinar, a trisit, a pundayon, or a pruta (all coins), he’s chayav, for all coins are like one.  You have a kor of produce of mine, you only have in my hands a letech (half a kor) of legumes, he’s patur.  You have a kor of produce of mine, you only have in my hands a letech of legumes, he’s chayav, for legumes are included in produce.  He claimed wheat and he admitted barley, he’s patur, and Raban Gamliel makes chayav.  One who claims from his friend jugs of oil and he admitted to him jars, Admon says, since he admitted part of the claim, he must make an oath, and Chachamim say, the admission is not the same type as the claim.  Raban Gamliel said, I see (the reason of) the words of Admon.  He claimed vessels and land, and he admitted vessels but denied land or admitted land and denied vessels, he’s patur.  If he admitted part of the land, he’s patur, part of the vessels, he’s chayav, for property which doesn’t have a security requires property which has security to be sworn on.", 
        "One does not swear over the claim of a deaf-mute, mentally infirm, or minor, and no oath is forced on a minor, but one forces an oath when (a claim is made against) a minor or hekdesh.", 
        "And these are things which one does not swear over, slaves, documents, lands, and hekdesh.  There is no kefel restitution by them and there is not restitution of four and five.  An unpaid guard doesn’t swear, and a paid guard doesn’t pay.  Rabi Shimon says, holy things which he is responsible for, he swears for them, and those which he isn’t responsible for, he doesn’t swear for.", 
        "Rabi Meir says, there are things which are on (attached to) the ground and they are not like land, and the Chachamim do not admit this to him.  How?  I delivered ten vines with fruit to you, and that one says, there were only five, Rabi Meir requires an oath, and the Chachamim say, anything attached to the ground is like the ground.  One does not swear except on something which is by size, weight, or number.  How?  I delivered a houseful (of grain) to you, (or) I delivered a pocketful to you, and that one says, I don’t know, but what you left, you take, he’s patur.  This (one) says, (the grain filled) up to the ledge, and this (one) says, until the window, he’s chayav.", 
        "One who lends his friend on collateral and he lost the collateral, he (the lender) said to him, I lent you a sela and it (the collateral) was worth a shekel (half a sela), and the other says, not so, you lent me a sela and it was worth a sela, he’s patur.  (The lender says) I lent you a sela on it, and it was worth a shekel, and the other says, not so, you lent me a sela and it was worth three dinar (meaning he still owes a dinar) he’s chayav (to an oath).  You lent me a sela on it and it was worth two (sela), and the other one says, not so, rather, I lent you a sela on it, and it was worth a sela, he’s patur.  You lent me a sela on it and it was worth two, and the other one says, not so, rather I lent you a sela and it was worth five dinar, he’s chayav.  And who swears?  The one who the deposit is by him, for perhaps this one will swear and that one will take out the deposit (and have an easy way to invalidate him as a witness)."
