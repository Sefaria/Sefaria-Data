        "How big must a vineyard’s karachat (see below) be to not be kilayim?  Beit Shamay says, twenty-four amot square.  Beit Hillel says sixteen.  How about the machol (see below)?  Beit Shamay says sixteen amot square.  Beit Hillel says twelve.  What is a vineyard’s karachat?  A vineyard that is empty in the middle, and if it’s not sixteen amot square, you may not bring in another seed.  If there is enough space, you give it the proper border to work the seed and you may plant it.", 
        "What is the machol of the vineyard?  The space between the vines and the fence.  If there aren’t twelve amot there, he may not plant another seed there.  If there is space, you leave space to work the grain and you may plant.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda says, that is merely called the fence of the vineyard.  So what is the machol?  Space between two vineyards.  What is considered a fence?  At least ten tfachim high.  What is considered a ditch?  At least ten tfachim deep and four wide.", 
        "A divider of reeds, if there are fewer than three tfachim between reeds, as much space as a kid needs to enter, it is a divider.  And a hole in a fence under ten amot is like an entrance, more than that, it is forbidden to plant (different species) near the hole.  A fence with many holes, if the fence is more than half there, it can be used.  If it is more than half holes, it is forbidden to plant near the holes.", 
        "One who plants a row of five vines, Beit Shamay says it’s a vineyard.  Beit Hillel says it isn’t until he plants two rows.  Therefore, one who plants within four amot of a vineyard, Beit Shamay says he made one row forbidden, and Beit Hillel says he made two rows forbidden.", 
        "If one plants two rows of two vines, and one projects like a tail (the fifth is its own column, forming a trapezoid), this is a vineyard.  Two rows of two with one in between (in its own row, forming a pentagon) or two rows of two with one in the middle (forming the five on a die) it’s not a vineyard, it only is if the fifth is like a tail.", 
        "One who plants one row of vines on his land and there is a row on his neighbor’s land, even if it has a private or public path between it or a fence shorter than ten tfachim, these combine.  If the fence is greater than ten tfachim, they don’t combine.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he intertwined them above the fence, they combine.", 
        "One who plants two rows, if there are fewer than eight amot between them, you may not plant between them.  If they are three rows, if there aren’t sixteen tfachim between an two rows, you can’t plant between them.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says in the name of Chanania ben Chachinay even if the middle one was destroyed, and the two outer rows now have sixteen tfachim between them you can’t plant between them, because if you had planted those two rows originally you would need eight amot.", 
        "One who plants his vineyard with rows sixteen amot apart may plant between the rows.  Rabi Yehuda said, there was a case in Tzalmon where a man planted like this, and he would turn the shoots different directions in alternate years and plant the land he had turned the shoots away from (thus alternating fallow and planted years for these patches) and he cam before the Chachamim and they allowed it.  Rabi Meir and Rabi Shimon say this is even allowed for one who plants his vineyard with rows spaced eight amot."
