        "One erev Pesach close to mincha, one does not eat before it gets dark.  And even a poor Jew may not eat until he reclines (as in the seder).  And they may not diminish (what they give) to him (and make it) any less than four cups of wine, even from the charity plate.", 
        "They mixed him the first cup, Beit Shamay said, he recites the blessing for the day and then for the wine, and Beit Hillel says, he blesses on the wine and then the day.", 
        "When they brought before him, he may dip the chazeret (lettuce) until he gets to the bread side dish.  They brought before him matza, chazeret, and charoset (a dish of chopped apples), even though charoset is not a mitzva.  Rabi Eliezer the son of Rabi Tzadok says, it is a mitzva.  And in the (times of the) Beit Hamikdash they would bring before him the body of the pesach.", 
        "They mixed him a second cup, and here the son asks his father (the questions of the seder).  And if the son doesn’t know, his father teaches him, how is this night different from all other nights?  For on all other nights we eat chametz and matza, tonight it is all matza.  For on all other nights we eat different vegetables, tonight we eat maror (bitter vegetable).  For on all other nights we eat food roasted, stewed, and cooked, tonight we eat only roasted.  For on all other nights we dip once (food was normally dipped in vinegar, brine, or the like), tonight we dip twice.  And according to the knowledge of the son his father teaches him.  He starts with despairing (talks about the slavery) and ends in glorious, he expounds from, “my father was a lost Aramean,” until he finishes the entire section.", 
        "Raban Gamliel used to say, anyone who has not said these three things on Pesach has not fulfilled his obligation, and these are they, pesach, matza, and marror.  Pesach because Hashem passed over the hoses of our forefathers in Egypt (in the plague of firstborns).  Matza since our forefathers were saved from (slavery in) Egypt.  Maror, because the Egyptians embittered the lives of our forefathers in Egypt.  In every a person is obligated to see himself as if he had left Egypt, as it says, “and you shall tell your children on that day saying, on behalf of this Hashem did for me when I left Egypt.”  Therefore, we are obligated to exalt, extol, praise, adorn, laud, beautify, bless, raise up, and commend the One who did all of these miracles for our forefathers and for us, He took us out from slavery to freedom, from depression to happiness, from mourning to holiday, from darkness to great light, and from subservience to salvation.  And we will say before Him Halleluya.", 
        "Until where does he say?  Beit Shamay says, until, “the mother of children is joyful” and Beit Hillel says, until, “a flint into his spring of water.”  And he seals it with (the blessing of) redemption.  Rabi Tarfon says, (the blessing is) that you have redeemed us and redeemed our forefathers from Egypt.  Rabi Akiva says, likewise Hashem our God and the God of our forefathers will bring us to other festivals and holidays which are coming towards us, in peace, happy in the building of Your city, and rejoicing in our service of You, and we will eat there from zvachim and psachim etc. until, “blessed are you Hashem, the redeemer of Israel.”", 
        "They poured him a third cup, he blesses on his food.  The fourth, he finishes the Hallel, and says on it the blessing of the song (the gemara differs on the meaning of this).  Between these cups, if he wants to drink, he may drink, but between the third and the fourth he may not drink.", 
        "One may not conclude after the pesach with afikoman (a term referring to desserts).  If some of them slept (during the seder) they may eat it, if all of them (slept at one point) they may not eat.  Rabi Yossi says, if they dozed, they may eat, if they fell asleep, they may not.", 
        "A pesach after midnight makes ones’ hands tame (it’s notar).  Pigul and notar tame the hands.  If he blesses the blessing on the pesach, he exempted him self from (blessing by) (the blessing) of zvachim, but if he blessed on the zvachim, he didn’t exempt that of the pesach, according to Rabi Yishma’el.  Rabi Akiva says, this does not exempt that and that does not except this."
