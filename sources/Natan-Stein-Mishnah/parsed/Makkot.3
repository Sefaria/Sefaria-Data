        "And these are the lashed, one who has sex with his sister, his father’s sister, his mother’s sister, his wife’s sister, his brother’s wife, the wife of his father’s brother, and a nidda, a widow for a kohen gadol, a divorcee or one who got chalitza for a lay kohen, or a mamzer or a Netina (groups who married in during the time of Yehoshua) to a Yisra’el.  A widow and a divorcee (one woman who is both) is chayav on two counts.  If she is both a divorcee and one who got chalitza it is only one count.", 
        "One who is tame who ate something holy, came to the Beit Hamikdash tame, or ate forbidden fats, blood, leftover korbanot, pigul (a korban intended to be eaten after time), and tame (korbanot), or one who slaughtered and offered outside (the Beit Hamikdash), ate chametz on Pesach, ate or did work on Yom Kippur, concocts oil (like the anointing oil), concocts the incense (like the incense mixture), anoints with the anointing oil, eats animals which died of natural causes, were torn apart, or are sheketz or remes, ate tevel or ma’aser rishon which didn’t have truma taken, or ate ma’aser sheni or hekdesh which wasn’t redeemed.  How much tevel must he eat to be chayav?  Rabi Shimon says, any at all, and Chachamim say a kzayit.  Rabi Shimon said to them, don’t you admit that he is chayav if he eats an ant, no matter how small?  They said to him, it is as it was created.  He said to them, so too a grain of wheat is as it was created (and is therefore significant).", 
        "One who eats bikurim before reading (the required psukim), the holiest of holies (meat of a chatat or asham) outside the hangings (the courtyard of the Beit Hamikdash), or normal holy things and ma’aser sheni outside the wall (of Yerushalayim).  One who breaks a bone in a tahor korban pesach, he is lashed with forty.  But one who leaves over from tahor or breaks a bone in the tame (korban pesach) isn’t lashed forty.", 
        "One who took a mother bird and her children, Rabi Yehuda says, he’s lashed and doesn’t send away (the mother), and Chachamim say, he sends but isn’t lashed.  This is the general rule, any negative mitzva which has a ‘get up and do’ (commandment to do), one isn’t chayav on it.  ", 
        "One who balds his head (as a sign of grieving), rounded the corner of his head (shaving hair), destroys the corner of his beard (shaves with a razor), or makes cuts (himself) once for the dead, is chayav.  If he made cut once for five people or five times for one person, he is chayav for each one.  On his head (rounding), two, once for this side and one for the other.  On his beard, two from here, two from there, and one for below (chin).  Rabi Eliezer says, if he took it all off at once, he’s only chayav one.  And isn’t chayav unless he takes it off with a razor.  Rabi Eliezer says, even if he took it off with pincers or an adze, he’s chayav.", 
        "One who writes and etches (tattoos), if he wrote but didn’t etch or etched but didn’t write, he’s not chayav, until he writes and etches in ink, eye shadow, or anything that leaves a mark.  Rabi Shimon ben Yehuda in the name of Rabi Shimon says, he isn’t chayav until he writes Hashem’s name, as it says, and a writing of etching you shall not put upon yourself I am Hashem”.", 
        "A nazir who drank wine all day is only chayav one.  They said to him, don’t drink, don’t drink, and he drinks, he is chayav on every one (drink). ", 
        "If he (the nazir) was become tame met the whole day, he is only chayav one.  If they said to him, don’t become tame, don’t become tame, and he became tame, he’s chayav on each one.  If he was shaving the whole day, he is only chayav one.  If they said to him, don’t shave, don’t shave, he’s chayav on each one.  If one wears kilayim the whole day, he’s only chayav one.  If they said to him, don’t wear it, don’t wear it, and he strips and puts it back on, he’s chayav on each one.", 
        "One can plow a single furrow and be chayav because of eight prohibitions, one who plows with an ox and a donkey, and they are hekdesh (the ox may not be not be used since it is a bechor, and the donkey may not be used since it is hekdesh), among vineyard kilayim, during shvi’it, on Yom Tov, and he is a kohen and a nazir in a tame place.  Chanania ben Chachinai says, he may also be wearing kilayim.  They said to him, this is not the same title (it is not directly related to his plowing).  He said to them, also him being a nazir isn’t the same title.", 
        "How much do we lash him?  Forty minus one, as it says, “by number forty,” a number which is close to (approaches) forty (i.e. thirty-nine).  Rabi Yehuda says, he is lashed a full forty.  And where does he get whipped the extra one (as we will see, lashes are divided between three places)?  Between his shoulders.", 
        "Yud We only evaluate him for lashes which are divisible by three.  They evaluated him to get forty, he got part of them, and they said he can’t get all forty, he’s patur.  If they evaluated him to get eighteen, and after he got lashed they said he could take forty, he’s patur.  If he did something which has two prohibitions, if they evaluate him once, he is whipped (for both, i.e. forty-two which include three for the second) and is patur.  If not, he is whipped, recovers, and is whipped again.", 
        "Yud How do you whip him?  They tie his two hands on a pillar an either side, the agent of the court grabs his clothes and if they are torn, they are torn, and if they come apart, they come apart, until he reveals his heart (the front too).  A rock is placed behind him, the agent of the court stands on it with a strap of calf (hide) in his hand, doubled up and redoubled up, and two straps going up and down it (tied along it).", 
        "Yud Its handle is a tefach, it’s a tefach wide, and its head reaches his navel.  He whips him one third on his front and tow thirds on his back, and he doesn’t whip him sitting or standing, rather leaning (on the pillar), as it says, “and the judge will cause him to tumble down.”  And the one who whips whips with one hand with all his strength.", 
        "Yud And the reader reads (while the person is being whipped), “and it you won’t guard to do etc.” and, “and Hashem will make great your blows, and the blows of etc.” and he returns to the beginning of the passage.  And if he died under the hand (of the agent of the court) he is patur (from having killed a man).  If he added another strap and he died, he is exiled.  If one dirties himself with excrement or urine, he is patur (they end the whipping).  Rabi Yehuda says, a man with excrement, a woman with (even) urine.", 
        "Tet Anyone chayav karet who got lased is patur from their karet as it says, “and your brother shall be lightened in your eyes,” when he is whipped he is like your brother, according to Rabi Chanina ben Gamliel.  Rabi Chanina ben Gamliel said, just as one who does one sin we take away his life, the one who does a mitzva, how much more so will he be given his soul.  Rabi Shimon says, from his place (source) we learn, as it says, “and the souls who do will be cut off etc.”  And it says, “which man shall do and live by them,” and behold, whoever sits and doesn’t sin gets reward as if he did a mitzva.  Rabi Shimon bar Rebi says, behold it says, “only hold strongly to not eat blood for the blood is the soul etc.”  And just as the blood, which is the soul of man, if one keeps away from it the one who removes himself from it gets reward, theft and inappropriate relations, for the soul of man yearns for them, one who removes himself from them ", 
        "How much more so will he merit for himself, for his generations, and for the generations of his generation until the end of all generations.", 
        "Tet Rabi Chanania ben Akashia says, Hashem wanted to give merit to the Jews, therefore he increased for them torah and mitzvot, as is says, “Hashem enjoys for the sake of His righteous, to enlarge torah and to make it glorious."
