        "Shamay says, all women, their time is sufficient (from the time they saw their menstrual blood to consider things they touch tame).  Hillel says, from check to check (all things she touched from the time of her last clean check are tame), even many days.  Chachamim say, it is not like this one’s opinion or that one’s opinion, rather it is like from time to time (a one day period) if it less than from check to check, or from check to check if it is less than from time to time.  All women who have a set flow, their time (that it usually comes) is good enough for them.  One who has relations and uses a proof cloth (to check before and after) this is like a check and she takes the lesser of time-to-time and check to check.", 
        "Shamay says, from a kav (or more flour) you do challa, and Hillel says, from two kav.  Chachamim say, it is not like this one’s opinion or that one’s opinion, rather from a kav and a half one is chayav challa.  From when the measurements were increased (when they moved to Tzippori they increased the measurements from the Jerusalem ones) they said, five fourths (of a kav) are chayav.  Rabi Yossi says, five are patur, five and a bit are chayav.", 
        "Hillel says, a full hin (twelve log) of drawn water invalidates a mikva, (and he would have used the modern measurement of log) but one must speak in the in the language of his Rebbe.  And Shamay says, nine kav.  Chachamim say, not is not like the opinion of this or the opinion of that.  Rather, it was when two weavers came from the Ashpot Gate in Yerushalayim and testified in the name of Shemaya and Avtalyon (Hillel and Shamay’s teachers) three log of drawn water invalidate a mikva, and the Chachamim stood up their words.", 
        "And why do they mention the opinions of Hillel and Shamay purposelessly?  To teach future generations that a person does not stand on their opinion (even when they are ruled against), for behold, the fathers of the world did not stand on their words.", 
        "And why do they mention the opinion of an individual among the many, since the ruling is only like the many?  For if the court sees (merit in) the opinion of the individual it will rely upon him, for a court cannot nullify the opinion of its fellow court until it is greater in number and wisdom.  If it was greater in wisdom but not number, or number or not wisdom, it cannot nullify its opinion, until it is greater in wisdom and in number.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda said, if so, why do we mention the opinion of the individual among the many which is nullified?  For if a person says, I accept like this, he will say to him, you heard like the opinion of so and so (who we don’t hold by).", 
        "Beit Shamay says, a rova of bones is (considered a significant piece) from the bones (and therefore makes tame ohel), whether from two (bones) or from three.  And Beit Hillel says, a rova of bones from the corpse (is enough) from the majority of the build or from a majority of the number (the bones are a majority of the organs, though both are miscounted based on modern science).  Shamay says, even one bone (which is of sufficient size is counted).", 
        "Truma vetches, Beit Shamay says, one soaks and rubs (on skin) while tahor, and feeds (to animals) while tame.  Beit Hillel says, one soaks while tahor, and one rubs or feeds while tame.  Shamay says, they should be eaten dry.  Rabi Akiva says, all of their actions may be done while tame.", 
        "One who exchanges (for) a sela from ma’aser sheni change, Beit Shamay says, for a whole sela (he exchanges) the change.  Beit Hillel says, a shekel of silver and a shekel of change (is what he can buy, and he will need the change to buy food).  Rabi Meir says, one may not redeem (a mix of) money and produce on money, and the Chachamim allow.", 
        "One who exchanges a sela of ma’aser sheni in Yerushalayim, Beit Shamay says, the whole sela (he can exchange for change) and Beit Hillel says, half silver, half copper.  Ones who judge before the Chachamim say, three silver dinar and one dinar of copper.  Rabi Akiva says, three silver dinar and (the last dinar) one quarter copper.  Rabi Tarfon says, four silver aspers (some part of the last dinar).  Shamay says, let him leave the money in a shop and eat its equivalent.", 
        "The chair of a bride from which the coverings have been removed (and may or may not be suitable for sitting), Beit Shamay (says if it was touched by a zav or zava) it is tame, and Beit Hillel say it is tahor.  Shamay says, even the framework of the chair is tame.  A chair which was attached to a kneading trough, Beit Shamay make tame, and Beit Hillel make tahor.  Shamay says, even a chair which is made in it.", 
        "These are things which Beit Hillel returned to agree with the opinion of Beit Shamay.  A woman who comes from a sea (overseas) nation and says, my husband died, she may marry, (or) my husband died, she gets yibum.  And Beit Hillel says, we only heard from when she came from the harvest (where she says he died while out to harvest).  Beit Shamay said to them, whether coming from the harvest, the olives, or a sea nation, they only said harvest because it was the current case.  Beit Hillel returned and admitted like Beit Shamay.  Beit Shamay says, the may get marry and she takes her ktuba.  Beit Hillel says, she may get marry but not take her ktuba.  Beit Shamay said to them, you allowed the strict intercourse, but you won’t allow the lax money?  Beit Hillel said to them, we have found that the brothers may not inherit the land based on her testimony.  Beit Shamay said to them, and don’t we learn from the document of the ktuba that he writes for her, that if she marries another, she may take what is written for her.  Beit Hillel returned to agree with the opinion of Beit Shamay.", 
        "One who is half slave half freedman works for his master one day and himself one day, according to Beit Hillel.  Beit Shamay said to them, you fixed it for the master, but for him you haven’t fixed it, he cannot marry a maidservant and he cannot marry a freedman (for each is forbidden to half of him), should he refrain (from getting married)?  And behold, wasn’t the world only created for being fruitful and multiplying, as it says, “not wasteful did He create it, to be inhabited He fashioned it.”  Rather, for the purpose of the public interest, they force his master and make him a freedman, and he rights a bill for half of his value.  Beit Hillel returned to agree with the opinion of Beit Shamay.", 
        "An earthenware vessel (if tahor and sealed) protects everything (from tuma) according to Beit Hillel.  And Beit Shamay says, it only protects food, drink, and earthenware vessels.  Beit Hillel said to them, why?  Beit Shamay said to them, because it is tame (if owned) by an am ha’aretz, and a tame vessel does not make a barrier.  Beit Hillel said to them, and didn’t you make food and drink in it tahor?  Beit Shamay said to them, when we made the food and drink tahor, we made it itself tahor, but when you made the vessel tahor, you made this and that tahor.  Beit Hillel returned to agree with the opinion of Beit Shamay."
