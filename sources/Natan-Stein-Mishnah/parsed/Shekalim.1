        "On the first of Adar they announce concerning shkalim (to prepare) and kilayim (to check the fields).  One the fifteenth of Adar, they would read the megilla in large cities, fix the roads, paths, and mikva’ot, attend to needs of the public, mark the graves, and go out looking for kilayim.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda said, they used to uproot and throw in front of the owners, but when many people transgressed, they would uproot and throw on the paths, and they decreed that they declare the entire field hefker.", 
        "On the fifteenth of Adar, moneychangers would go sit in the country.  On the twenty-fifth they sat in the beit hamikdash.  From the twenty-fifth, they began to (forcibly) collect collateral.  Who would they take collateral from?  From levi’im, yisra’elim, converts, and freedmen, but not from women, slaves, and minors.  Any minor whose father began to contribute for him shall not stop.  And they do not take collateral from kohanim, out of the ways of peacefulness.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda said, Ben Bruchri testified at Yavneh that any kohen who gives a half-shekel hasn’t sinned.  Raban Yochanan ben Zakai said to him, this isn’t so, but any kohen who doesn’t give a half-shekel is sinning.  Rather the kohanim explain this pasuk for themselves, “every mincha (an offering) for the kohen, complete (burned) shall it be, it shall not be eaten.”  Since the omer, and the two breads, and the showbread is for us, how may we eat them (they come from communal funds, and should be burnt, but the kohanim may eat them which shows that the rules for these offerings don’t apply, and thus they don’t have to bring the half-shekel)?", 
        "Even though they said, one does not take collateral from women, slaves, and children, if they give a half-shekel, we accept it.  A non-Jew or kuti who gives, we do not accept from them.  Nor do we accept from them the offerings of a zav, zava, or woman who has just given birth, or chata’ot or ashamot, but we do accept vow offerings or gift offerings.  This is the general rule, anything that can be vowed or gifted we accept, but whatever can’t be vowed or gifted we don’t accept.  And likewise is learned out from Ezra, as it says, “it is not for them and us to build the Beit Hamikdash.”", 
        "And these are those which are chayav in the surcharge on the half-shekel (a kalbon), levi’im, yisra’elim, converts, and freedmen, but not kohanim, women, slaves, and children.  One who gives the half-shekel on behalf of a kohen, women, slave, or child is patur.  And if he gave for himself and for his friend, he only owes one kalbon.  Rabi Meir says, two kalbon.  One who gives a sela (a full shekel) and takes a shekel (changes money) owes two kalbon (one for changing money and one as a surcharge).", 
        "One who gives a half-shekel on behalf of a poor person, his neighbor, or his townsman is patur (from the kalbon).  If he lent them, he’s chayav.  Brothers and partners are chayav by a kalbon, but they are exempt from ma’aser behema.  But when they are obligated in ma’aser behema (when the property is not part of a partnership), they are patur from the kalbon.  How much is a kalbon?  A silver ma’ah (one twenty-fourth of a sela), according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, half that."
