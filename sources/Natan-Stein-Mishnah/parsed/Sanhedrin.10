        "All Jews have a portion in the world to come, as it is written, “and your nation is all righteous, forever will they inherit the land, the branch of My planting, and the work of My hands to be glorified.”  And these are they who do not have a portion in the world one who says, Resurrection of the dead isn’t from the torah, one who thinks the torah isn’t from Heaven, and a heretic who mocks torah (apikores).  Rabi Akiva says, also one who reads external (non-Rabbinic) books about torah, one who whispers to a wound and says, “all the sickness I put on Egypt I will not put on you for I Hashem am your healer.”  Abba Shaul says, also one who says the Name by its letters.", 
        "Three kings and four hedyotot (people who do not have smicha linked to Moshe) have no portion in the world to come.  The kings are Yiravam, Achav, and Menashe.  Rabi Yehuda says, Menashe has a portion in the world to come, as it says, “and he prayed to Hashem and begged Him and He listened to his supplication and He brought him back to Yerushalayim to his kingdom.”  They said to him, Hashem returned him for his kingdom, He didn’t return him for the world to come.  The Bilam, Do’eg, Achitofel, and Geychazi.", 
        "The generation of the flood has no portion in the world to come, and they aren’t judged, as it says, “My spirit will never judge these people,” no judgment and no spirit.  The generation of the Tower of Babble has no portion in the world to come, as it says, “and Hashem scattered them from there unto the face of the earth.”  “And Hashem scattered them,” in this world, “and from there Hashem scattered them,” for the world to come.  The people of Sdom have no portion in the world to come, as it says, “and the people of Sdom are evil and sins to Hashem very much.”  “Evil,” in this world, “and sins,” for the world to come.  But they are judged.  Rabi Nechemia says, neither of these has judgment, as it says, “because of this the wicked will not be avenged with judgment, also sinners in an assembly of the righteous.”  “Because of this the wicked will not be avenged with judgment,” this is the generation of the flood, “also sinners in an assembly of the righteous,” this is Sdom.  They said to him, the people of Sdom weren’t in an assembly of the righteous, they were in an assembly of the wicked.  The spies have no portion in the world to come, as it says, “and the people who said bad things about the land (Israel) died in an affliction before Hashem.”  “Died,” in this world, “in an affliction,” in the world to come.  The generation of the desert has not part in the world to come and isn’t judged, as it says, “in the desert they will be consumed and there they will die,” according to Rabi Akiva.  Rabi Eliezer says, about them it is written, “collect for me my pious ones, who sealed a covenant with me by sacrifice.”  Korach’s assembly has no future to rise up, as it says, “and the land covered them up,” for this world, “and they got lost in the congregation,” for the world to come, according to Rabi Akiva.  Rabi Eliezer says, it says about them, “Hashem has die and gives life, lowers to the depths and raises.”  The ten lost tribes aren’t going to return, as it says, “and he sent them to a different land until this day.”  Just as this day goes and never returns, so too they go and never return, according to Rabi Akiva.  Rabi Eliezer says, just as today grows dark and grows light, so too the ten tribes it darkened for them, and it will lighten for them.", 
        "The people of a wayward city have no place in the world to come, as it says, “base men have come out of your midst and they led astray the residents of their city.”  They aren’t killed until they are from the same city and the same tribe, most of the town has bean misled, and the men have misled it.  If the women and children misled it, or only a minority has been misled, of if the person who led astray was from the outside, these are treated as individuals, and you need two witnesses and warning for each one.  This is a stringency by individuals as compared to the many, for individuals are stoned so their property is saved (as a redeeming factor), but the many die by sword, therefore their property is lost.", 
        "“Smite shall you smite etc.” a pack of donkey-riders or camel-riders, which passes from place to place, behold these can the wayward city.  “Destroy it and all that is in it etc.” from here they said, the property of the righteous that are in it are lost, that are outside the city, are spare, and of the wicked whether inside or outside of the city are lost.", 
        "As it says, “and all the spoils of the city, you shall gather into its open area etc.”  If it doesn’t have an open area, you make one.  If the open are is outside the city, they build the city’s wall such that it will be inside.  “And you shall burn by fire the city and all of its spoils, all of it for Hashem,” its spoils, and not the spoils of heaven (holy objects).  From this they said, hekdesh in it will be redeemed, truma will rot, and ma’aser sheni and holy writings will be hidden.  “All of it for Hashem,” Rabi Shimon said, Hashem said, if you judge a wayward city I put upon you as if you go up in your entirety as an olah before me.  “And it shall be a heap forever, it will never be rebuilt,” you can’t even make gardens or orchards, according to Rabi Yossi Hagelili.  Rabi Akiva says, “it will never be rebuilt,” to as it was you can’t build it, but you can make gardens and orchards.  “And none of the banned items may stay in your hand,” that whenever there are wicked in this world, there is extreme anger in the world, when the wicked are destroyed, extreme anger is removed from the world."
