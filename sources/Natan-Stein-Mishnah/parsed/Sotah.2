        "He (the husband) would bring her mincha (for he brought a korban for her when she was going to drink) in an Egyptian basket and put it on her hands in order to tire her.  All of the menachot their beginning and end was in service vessels, and this, its beginning is in an Egyptian basket and its end in a service vessel.  All the menachot need oil and frankincense (in addition to flour) and this does not need oil or frankincense.  All of the menachot are from flour, and this comes from barley.  The omer mincha, even though it comes from barley, it comes sifted, and this comes as meal.  Raban Gamliel says, just as her act is the act of an animal, so too her korban is the food of an animal.", 
        "He would bring a new earthenware bowl, and put half a log of water into it from the sink.  Rabi Yehuda says, a revi’it.  Just as he (Rabi Yehuda) diminishes (the amount of) writing he diminishes water.  He went into the sanctuary and turned right, and there was a place one amah by one amah with a marble flagstone (disconnected from the others) with a ring was fastened on it, and when he would raise it (by pulling the ring), he would take dust from under it and put (into the water, for dust from the Beit Hamikdash was part of the water), such that it would be seen on the water, as it says, “and from the dust which will be on the floor of the mishkan the kohen will take and put on the water.”", 
        "He came to write the scroll, from where (in the parsha of sota in Bamidbar hay) does he write?  From, “if a man has not lain etc.” “and you because you drank instead of your husband.”  And he does not write, “and the kohen makes the woman swear.”  And he writes, “Hashem will give to you for a curse and an oath,” “and these cursing waters will come in your bowels and make your stomach swell and your thigh fall away.”  And he does not write, “and the woman shall say, amen, amen.”  Rabi Yossi says, he wouldn’t stop (for the psukim they said to omit).  Rabi Yehuda says, all of this he does not write except, “Hashem will give to you for a curse and an oath etc.” “and these cursing waters will come in your bowels etc.” And he does not write, and the woman shall say, amen, amen.”", 
        "He does not write on a tablet, on paper, or on inadequate parchment, rather on parchment, as it says, “in the book.”  And he does not write with gum-based ink, calcanthum, and not with anything which marks down except with ink, as it says, “and he shall erase (dissolve),” a writing that can erase.", 
        "On what does she say amen amen?  Amen on the curse, amen on the oath.  Amen from this man, and amen from that man, amen that I did not commit adultery while engaged, married, waiting for yibum, or consummated.  Amen that I didn’t become tame, and if I became tame, let them come to me (the curses).  Rabi Meir says, amen that I did not become tame, amen that I will not become tame.", 
        "All is equal that he does not make a condition with her (force her to swear about) before she gets engaged (as an extension of her swear about sota), and not after she will get married.  If she secluded (herself with a man) afterwards and she became tame and afterwards she returned, he cannot make a condition with her.  This is the general rule, wherever she (could have) had sex and she wouldn’t be assur to him, he could not make a condition with her."
