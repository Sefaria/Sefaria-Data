        "Rabi Yehoshua ben Bteira testified about the blood of nevelot that it is tahor.  Rabi Shimon ben Bteira testified about the ashes of a chatat part of which touched something tame that it made the whole thing (ashes) tame.  Rabi Akiva added the fine flour (brought as a mincha), incense, frankincense, and coals which a tvul yom (one who immersed that day to purify himself) touched part of, he invalidated all of it.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda ben Bava and Rabi Yehuda Hakohen testified about a minor bat yisra’el who married a kohen that she eats truma since she entered the chupa (bridal canopy) even though she has not had sex with him.  Rabi Yossi Hakohen and Rabi Zachariah ben Hakatzav testified about a baby which was taken as a pledge (against a loan by non-Jews) in Ashkalon, and her family (who were kohanim) distanced her (would not let her marry a kohen) and her witnesses (who testified she was left as a pledge) testify for her that she was not concealed and she was not defiled.  The Chachamim said to them, if you believe she was taken as a pledge, believe that she was not concealed and not defiled, and if you don’t believe that she wasn’t concealed and wasn’t defiled, don’t believe that she was taken as a pledge.", 
        "Rabi Yehoshua and Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira testified about the widow of an isah (a family of kohanim in which one of the men married a woman who it is unclear whether she was a divorcee or a widow) that she is kosher for kohanim (for if she married a chalal, even as a widow she is assur to kohanim), the isah (family)is kosher (to testify whether she is) tahor or tame (has even been defiled or not), and to distance and draw near (decide whether a girl was defiled or not).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, we received your testimony but what should we do, since Raban Yochanan ben Zakai decreed not to set up courts for this (and since we can’t really decide) the kohanim listen to you to distance, but not to draw near.", 
        "Rabi Yossi ben Yoezer a man of Tzrara testified about ayal kamtza (a species of locust) that it is kosher, the liquid (blood which flows out of) the slaughterhouse (in the Beit Hamikdash that it is (always) tahor, and that (in a public place only) a person who touches a dead body (and not anyone in the area) becomes tame.  And (because of these rulings) they called him Yossi the permitter.", 
        "Rabi Akiva testified in the name of Nechemia a man of Beit Dli that one may marry a woman based on (only) one witness (testifying that her husband died overseas).  Rabi Yehoshua testified about bones which were found in a woodshed (in the woman’s courtyard in the Beit Hamikdash), the Chachamim said, he takes bone by bone and everything (is presumed) tahor.  ", 
        "Rabi Eliezer says, I heard that when they were building the sanctuary they made hangings (surrounding curtains) for the sanctuary and hanging for the courtyards, except that they built the sanctuary from outside (inward), and in the courtyard they build from inside.  Rabi Yehoshua said, I heard that they would offer (korbanot in the place of the Beit Hamikdash) even though there is not house (Beit Hamikdash), and they would eat the holy of holies even though there are no hangings (within which these korbanot were eaten) and (they would eat) lightly holy things and ma’aser sheni (which had to be eaten in Yerushalayim) even though there was no wall, for the holiness of the first (Beit Hamikdash) made holy for its time and for the future.", 
        "Rabi Yehoshua said, I got (a tradition) from Raban Yochanan ben Zakai for hear from his rav, and his rav from his rav, a halacha to Moshe from Sinai, that Eliyahu will not come to make tame and tahor (lineage), distance and draw near (women who may have been defiled) but to distance those who were drawn near by force and to draw close those who were distanced by force.  (an example of such a case is) the family of Beit Tzrifa which was in Transjordan, and Ben Tzion (a powerful person) distanced them by force.  And there was another one there which Ben Tzion with force, (cases) such as there Eliyahu will come to make tame and tahor to distance and draw close.  Rabi Yehuda says to draw near, but not to distance.  Rabi Shimon says, to settle disputes.  Chachamim say, not to distance and draw close, rather to make peace in the world, as it says, “and he shall return the heart of fathers on sons and the heat of sons on their fathers.”"
