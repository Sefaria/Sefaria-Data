        "Whatever is more common than its fellow comes before its fellow.  The temidim (daily offerings) come before the musafim (festive offerings), the musafim of Shabbat come before the musafim of Rosh Chodesh, and the musafim of Rosh Chodesh come before the musafim of Rosh Hashana, as it says, “next to the olah of the morning which is for (the sake of) the constant olah shall you do these.”", 
        "And whatever is holier than its fellow comes before its fellow, the blood of a chatat comes before the blood of an olah, because it makes atonement.  The organs of an olah come before the portions of a chatat because they are entirely for the fires.  A chatat comes before an asham because its blood is given (sprinkled) on the four corners (of the mizbe’ach) and the base.  An asham comes before a toda and (before) the ram of a nazir, because it is holy of holies.  The toda and the ram of a nazir come before the shlamim because they are eaten for (only) one day and require bread.  A shlamim comes before a bechor because they require giving (sprinkling) of four, leaning, libations, and waving of the breast and the thigh.", 
        "A bechor comes before (animal) ma’aser because its holiness is from the womb and it is eaten (only) by the kohanim.  Ma’aser comes before (sacrifices of) fowl because it is a zevach, and it has holy of holies (in the form of) its blood and its portions.", 
        "Fowl comes before menachot because they are kinds of blood (have blood).  The mincha of a sinner comes before the mincha as a donation because it comes for a sin.  A chatat of fowl comes before an olah of fowl, and so too with its hekdesh (when declaring two birds, the first is a chatat and the second an olah).", 
        "All of the chata’ot in the torah come before the ashamot except for the asham of the metzora because it comes in order to validate (finish his atonement).  All of the ashamot which are in the torah are brought two years old and are brought with (at least) the value of a shekel, except for the asham of the nazir and the asham of the metzora, for they come one year old and they do not come with the value of a shekel.", 
        "Just as these come first in their offering, so too they come first in their eating.  (If one has) shlamim from yesterday and shlamim from today, those of yesterday come first.  Shlamim from yesterday and a chatat or asham from today, those of yesterday come first, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, the chatat comes first, because it is the holy of holies.", 
        "And in all of them the kohanim can change their way of eating, to eat them roasted, stewed, boiled, to put chulin spices into them, or to put truma spices into them, according to Rabi Shimon.  Rabi Meir says, he may not put in them spices of truma so that he will not bring the truma to the hands of being pasul (if they become notar).", 
        "Rabi Shimon said, if you saw oil which was being divided up in the courtyard, you don’t have to ask, what is it, rather, (it is) the leftovers of the wafers of menachot of a yisra’el or the log of oil of a metzora.  If you saw oil which was being put on the fire, you do not need to ask, what is that, rather, it is the leftover of wafers of menachot of kohanim and the mincha of the anointed kohen, for they (people) do not donate oil.  Rabi Tarfon says, one may donate oil."
