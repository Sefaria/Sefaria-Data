        "One may feed the poor and quartered troops dmai.  Raban Gamliel would feed his workers dmai.  People who collect tzedaka, Beit Shamay said you would give me’usar food to those who don’t take ma’aser, and non-me’usar food to those who take ma’aser, therefore everyone will eat ma’aser-ed food.  Chachamim say you collect anything and distribute anything, those who want to take ma’aser will.", 
        "One who wants to cut off the undesirable tops of a tuber vegetable to lighten his load cannot throw it out until it’s me’usar.  One who buys vegetables at the shuk and wants to return it cannot return it until he takes ma’aser, for the only thing he didn’t do was count his bundles, i.e. they were his and he needed to take ma’aser.  If one was about to buy, but saw some better produce, you can return without ma’aser, since you didn’t acquire it.", 
        "If one finds fruit on the road and he takes it to eat it, but decides to save it, he may not save it until he takes ma’aser.  But if he took it so it wouldn’t get lost (not to eat) he’s patur from ma’aser.  Anything which one can’t sell as dmai, one can’t give to his friend if it’s dmai.  Rabi Yossi allows it when it is certainly not me’usar, as long as he knows that it’s not.", 
        "If one brings wheat to a kuti or an am ha’aretz miller, its status of ma’asrot and shmitot is assumed unchanged.  If one brings to a non-Jewish miller, it’s dmai.  Same with depositing fruit by someone, except the non-Jew’s is considered tevel.  Rabi Shimon says it’s only dmai.", 
        "One who gives an innkeeper, takes ma’aser from what he gives and what he gets, because we suspect she might exchange produce.  Rabi Yossi says, we are not accountable for deceivers, you only take ma’aser on what you get from her.", 
        "One who gives his mother-in-law, he takes ma’aser from what he gives and gets, because we suspect she will switch it if it burns.  Rabi Yehuda says, she wants her daughter to be favorable and is embarrassed in front of her son-in-law.  Rabi Yehuda admits that if he gives food which is shvi’it she is not suspected of switching, because she would not feed her daughter any inappropriate shvi’it."
