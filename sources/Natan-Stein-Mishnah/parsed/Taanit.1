        "From when do we mention the heroism of rain (a prayer for rain in the shmone esrey)?  Rabi Eliezer says, from the first (day of) Yom Tov of Sukkot.  Rabi Yehoshua says, from the last of Yom Tov of Sukkot.  Rabi Yehoshua said to him, since rain is only a sign of curse on Sukkot, why should he mention it?  Rabi Eliezer said (back) to him, even I didn’t say to ask (for rain) rather to mention, the one who makes the wind blow and the rain fall in its season.  He said (back) to him, (if) so, one should always mention.", 
        "One does not ask for rain except (when it is) close to (the period) of rain.  Rabi Yehuda says, the one who passes before the ark (the shaliach tzibur) on the last of Yom Tov of Sukkot, the last one (the one for musaf) mentions, and the first (for shacharit) does not mention.  On the first Yom Tov of Pesach, the first one mentions and the last one doesn’t mention.  Until when do they ask for rain?  Rabi Yehoshua says, until Pesach passes.  Rabi Meir says, until Nisan finishes, as it says, “and He will make rain fall for you, the first rain and last rain in the first (month, Nisan).”", 
        "On the third day of Marcheshvan they ask for rain.  Raban Gamliel says, on the seventh of it, fifteen days after Sukkot, such that the last in Israel will reach the Euphrates (and not be caught in the rains).", 
        "If the seventeenth of Marcheshvan comes and no rain fell, the individuals would start to fast three fasts (literally afflictions, but commonly used to refer to fasts).  They eat and drink when it gets dark, and are allowed to do melacha, wash, anoint, wear leather sandals, and have sexual relations.", 
        "If Rosh Chodesh Kislev came and no rain fell, the court enacts three fasts on the public.  They eat and drink when it gets dark, and are allowed to do melacha, wash, anoint, wear leather sandals, and have sexual relations.", 
        "If these passed and they haven’t been answered, the court enacts three other fasts on the public.  They may eat and drink while still day (the fast starts on the nightfall prior), and they are prohibited from melacha, bathing, anointing, wearing leather sandals, and sexual relations, and they lock the bathhouses.  If these passed and they weren’t answered, the court enacts another seven, which makes thirteen fasts, on the public.  Behold these are additional to the first ones, for on these they sound an alarm and lock the stores.  On Mondays they lean (open the doors) when it darkens (to allow people to buy food), and on Thursdays they are allowed out of respect for Shabbat.", 
        "If these passed and they weren’t answered, they diminish trade, building, planting, engagements, marriages, social greetings, like people rebuked by Hashem.  The individuals return to fasting until Nisan goes out.  If Nisan went out and rain fell it is a sign of curse, for is says, “is it not the harvest of wheat today etc.”"
