        "One who buys from a baker, what does he do about ma’asrot?  He takes enough for trumat ma’aser and challa and says, one per cent of what is here, this here is ma’aser, and the rest that makes up ma’aser rishon is next to it.  What I did ma’aser is trumat ma’aser, and the rest that I took is for challa, and my ma’aser sheni is such and such part, and I redeem it with money.", 
        "One who wants to take ma’aser and trumat ma’aser at once takes one in 33 1/3 and says, one percent on this side is chulin, and the rest is truma from the whole. And the hundred chulin, this part is ma’aser and the rest of the ma’aser is next to it, this that I set aside is trumat ma’aser for it, and the rest is challa.  And this ma’aser sheni is redeemed with money.", 
        "One who buys from a baker can take ma’aser from the hot to allow him to eat the cold (inferior), and vice versa, even if they are different shaped breads, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda disagrees, saying, wheat from last night gets one ma’aser, and from today needs another one.  Rabi Shimon forbids crossover in trumat ma’aser, but allows for challa.", 
        "One who buys from a bread seller (who sells dmai from different bakers) takes ma’aser from each form according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, one ma’aser for all forms (i.e. the seller probably buys from only one baker).  Rabi Yehuda admits that if he buys from a monopolist (who will buy from all the bakers) he takes ma’aser on each.", 
        "One who buys from the poor, or if a poor person was given a slice of bread or pressed figs, he takes ma’aser from all of them separately.  But with dates and dried figs, he may mix them and take one ma’aser.  Rabbi Yehuda said, when is this?  When the gift is large, but if it’s small, he takes separate ma’asrot.", 
        "One who buys wholesale and buys from him again may not take ma’aser from one for the other, even if they are from the same container or the same type of food.  We believe the wholesaler if he says they are from one source.", 
        "One who buys from the owner of a field and buys from him again may take ma’aser from one for the other.  Even if the food is from two containers or two towns.  A field owner who sold his food in the shuk, if the food is from his field, you may take ma’aser from one for the other, but if he gets from other people’s fields, you may not.", 
        "One who buys tevel from two different places can take ma’aser from one on the other even though one may not sell tevel unless it is necessary (if chulin was mixed in).", 
        "You can take ma’aser on a Jew’s produce to exempt a non-Jew’s produce, vice versa, a Jew’s on a kuti’s, and a kuti’s on a kuti’s.  Rabi Eliezer prohibits a kuti’s on a kuti’s.", 
        "Produce grown in a pot with a hole is as if it were grown in the soil.  If he gave truma from produce from the soil on that from a pot or vice versa, it counts.  From an un-holed pot on a holed it is still truma, but he must give from the holed.  From a holed on an un-holed, it’s truma, but he can’t eat it until he takes truma and ma’aser.", 
        "He took truma from dmai for dmai or from dmai on tevel, it’s truma, but he has to take truma again.  From tevel on dmai, it’s truma, but he can’t eat until he takes truma and ma’aser."
