        "An ox (which was tam) which gored four or five oxen, one after another, pays for the last of them (for he pays from the body of the ox, so he only pays the last), and if there is leftover (from paying for the last), he returns to the one before it (he pays the second to last), and if there is leftover from that, he pays to the one before, and the last one, the last one profits (has precedence in payment) , according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Shimon says, an ox worth two hundred (zuz) which gored an ox worth two hundred, and the carcass is worthless, this takes a maneh and that takes a maneh.  If it went back and gored another ox worth two hundred, the last one takes a maneh and the one before it, this one takes fifty zuz and that one takes fifty zuz.  If it went back and gored another ox worth two hundred, the last one takes a maneh, the one before it fifty zuz, and the first two (involved), a golden dinar (twenty-five zuz each).", 
        "An ox which is mua’d for its kind (other oxen) and is not mu’ad for other kinds, is mu’ad for people but is and mu’ad for animals, or is mu’ad for small ones (people or animals) but not for large ones, that which it is mu’ad for he pays the full damage, and that which he is not mu’ad for he pays half the damage.  They said before Rabi Yehuda, behold if there is (an ox) mu’ad for Shabbat and not mu’ad for weekdays?  He said to them, on Shabbat he pays the full damage, and on weekdays he pays half the damage.  When is he tam?  When he return from it (goring) three days of Shabbat.", 
        "An ox of a Jew which gored an ox of hekdesh or an ox of hekdesh which gored an ox of a Jew, it is patur (for there is no damage liability where there is me’ila), as it says, “the ox of his friend,” and not an ox of hekdesh.  An ox of a Jew which gored the ox of a non-Jew, he is patur.  The ox of a non-Jew which gored the ox of a Jew, whether tam or mu’ad, he pays the full damage.", 
        "The ox of a person of sound senses which gored that f a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor, he’s chayav.  And of a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor, which gored the ox of a person of sound senses, he’s patur.  The ox of a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor which gored, the court enacts for them a guardian, and they testify for them (about the case) in front of the guardian.  If the deaf-dumb became of sound senses, if the mentally infirm person became sane, or the minor grew up, it returns to being a tam, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, behold he is of his status.  An ox of the stadium (which was trained to gore) is not liable to death, as it says, “when it gores,” and not that they make it gore.", 
        "An ox which gored a person and he died, if it’s mu’ad he pays the value (of the person), and if tam, he is patur from the value, but this and that are liable to death, like this with a son and like this with a daughter (if they were killed).  If it gored a slave or a maidservant, he gives thirty sela, whether he (the slave) is worth a maneh or if he’s worth only one dinar.", 
        "An ox which was scratching on a wall and it (the wall) fell on a person, (the ox) intended to kill and animal and killed a person, (intended to kill) a non-Jew and killed a Jew, or an unviable child (which was born too early) but killed a viable child, it is patur.", 
        "The ox of a woman, the ox of orphans, the ox of a guardian (for a person unable to take care of it), the ox of the desert (which has no owner), the ox of hekdesh, the ox of a convert who died and has no heirs, behold these are chayav death (if they kill a person).  Rabi Yehuda says, the ox of the wilderness, the ox of hekdesh, and the ox a convert who died (without heirs) are patur from death, since they do not have owners.", 
        "An ox which was going out to be stoned and its owner made it hekdesh, it is not made hekdesh.  If he slaughtered it (though it was going to be stoned) its meat is assur.  And if its owner made it hekdesh before its judgment was finished, it is made hekdesh, and if he slaughtered it, its meat is mutar.", 
        "If he gave it to an unpaid guardian, borrower, one (a guardian) who takes money, or a renter, they enter in place of the owners, a mu’ad pays the full damage and a tam pays half the damage.  If the owner tied it with its reins and locked (the opening) before it as is proper, and it went out and damages, whether tam or mu’ad he is chayav according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, a tam is chayav and a mu’ad is patur, as it says (regarding a mu’ad), “and should his owner not guard it,” and this one was guarded.  Rabi Eliezer says, it (a mu’ad ox) has no guarding except a knife (the owner must kill it)."
