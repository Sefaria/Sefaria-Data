        "A woman was eating truma, and people came and told her, your husband died, or, your husband divorced you, and so too a slave who was eating truma and they came and told him, your master died, he sold you to a yisra’el, he gave you as a gift, or, he made you a freedman, and so too with a kohen who was eating truma and he found out he’s the son of a divorcee or widow, Rabi Eliezer says they owe the principal and chomesh, and Rabi Yehoshua allows it.  If a kohen was standing and making an offering on the altar, and he finds out that he is the son of a divorcee or a widow, Rabi Eliezer says, all the offerings he made on the altar are invalid, and Rabi Yehoshua says they are valid.  If he (the kohen) found out that he had a blemish, they are invalid.", 
        "And everyone who had truma in their mouth, Rabi Eliezer says, they swallow, and Rabi Yehoshua says, they must spit it out.  If they said to him, you were tame and the truma was tame, or he found that it is tevel, or ma’aser rishon that hasn’t had truma taken, or ma’aser sheni or hekdesh that wasn’t redeemed, or that he tasted the taste of a bug in his mouth, he must spit it out.", 
        "One was eating a bunch of grapes (from the garden, before taking ma’aser), and he moved from the garden to the courtyard (meaning it is no longer random and he must take ma’aser), Rabi Eliezer says, he may finish it, and Rabi Yehoshua says, he may not finish it.", 
        "Wine for truma that was found uncovered, he must spill it (even though it truma, it is not wasting for we fear it may have been tampered with).  And needless to say, this is the same if it is chulin.  Three drinks aren’t allowed once they are uncovered, water, wine, and milk.  All other drinks are allowed.  How much must they remain (uncovered) before they become assur (for fear of snake venom)?  Enough time for a reptile to come from close by and drink.", 
        "The amount of water that may be uncovered, enough for the venom to be lost in it (sufficiently diluted).  Rabi Yossi says in vessels any amount, but on the ground, up to forty se’ah.", 
        "Gnawed figs, grapes, squash, gourds, watermelons, or cucumbers, even if there is a kikar (a large measurement) of fruit on the tree all nibbled, whether the fruit is large or small, whether plucked or unplucked, if the fruit is moist, it’s assur (for fear of venom).  An animal bitten by a snake is assur (even if it doesn’t die that way) because it is dangerous to one’s life.", 
        "A wine strainer becomes assur if uncovered, Rabi Nechemia allows wine strained through it.", 
        "A barrel of truma that upon it arose a doubt of uncleanliness (through venom), Rabi Eliezer says, if it was placed in an exposed place, he should put it in a hidden place, and if it was uncovered, he should cover it (to protect the truma from becoming unclean).  Rabi Yehoshua says, if it was in a hidden place, he should put it in an exposed place, and if it was covered, he should uncover it (so it will definitely be unclean, and he may dispose of it).  Raban Gamliel says, he shouldn’t change anything about it.", 
        "A barrel that broke in the upper part of a winepress (where grapes are pressed), and the bottom part (where the wine flows) contains tame wine, Rabi Eliezer and Rabi Yehoshua admit, if he can save a revi’it of the tahor, he should save it, but if not, Rabi Eliezer says, it should simply flow down and become tame, and not become tame by way of any action of his.", 
        "So too with a barrel of oil which spilled , Rabi Eliezer and Rabi Yehoshua admit, if he can save a revi’it of the tahor, he should save it, and if not, Rabi Eliezer says, let if go and be absorbed (by the ground) and not become tame b way of any action of his.", 
        "Yud On both of these Rabi Yehoshua says, this isn’t truma that I must be careful not to let become tame, rather which I cannot eat (and thus may become tame).  And what may I not let become tame?  He was traveling from place to place, and had loaves of truma in his hand, and a non-Jew said to him, give me one to make tame, and if not, I will make them all tame, Rabi Eliezer says, let him make them all tame, he shouldn’t give one over to be tame.  Rabi Yehoshua says, let him place one on a rock before him.", 
        "Yud So too for women to whom non-Jews said, give us one of you and we will defile her, and if not we will defile all of you, let them all be defiled and let them not give over the soul of a Jew."
