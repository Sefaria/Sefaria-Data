        "A woman whose husband and rival went overseas, and they told her, your husband died, she may not marry or get yibum, until she knows if her rival is pregnant (if she is, she may marry but not do yibum, and if she is not, she must do yibum and may not marry).  If she has a mother-in-law, she does not suspect (that her mother-in-law gave birth overseas and now she has someone with whom to do yibum).  If her mother-in-law left full (pregnant), she does suspect.  Rabi Yehoshua says, she does not suspect.", 
        "Two yevamot (married to two brothers who had no other brothers), one says, my husband died, and one says, my husband died, they may not marry because of the other one’s husband (for he may be alive and need to do yibum).  If one has witnesses and one doesn’t have witnesses, the one who has witnesses is assur, and the one who doesn’t have witnesses is mutar (to marry others).  If one has sons and one doesn’t have sons, the one who has sons is mutar (for she doesn’t need yibum), and the one who doesn’t have sons is assur.  If they got yibum (from other brothers who are alive) and the yevamim die (leaving no living brothers), that are prohibited from marrying.  Rabi Elazar says, since they were allowed to the yevamim, they are allowed to everyone (since they did yibum, we assumed their husbands were in fact dead).", 
        "One only testifies (that someone died when they saw their) face with the nose, even if there are signs (like height or size) on his body and his clothes (for it may be someone else).  They only testify once (they saw) his soul depart, even if they saw him cut (apart), crucified, or being eaten by an animal.  They only testify (about having seen a person dead) up to three days (after death, because after that it looks different).  Rabi Yehuda ben Bava says, not all people, places, and times are the same (in the rate of change of appearance).", 
        "If he fell into water, whether it (the water) has (a visible) end (in all directions) or it has not end, his wife is assur (from marrying, for he may have gotten out).  Rabi Meir said, once there was one who fell into a large pit and came up after three days.  Rabi Yossi says, once a blind person went to immerse in a cave and his guide went after him, and they were there long enough for their souls to depart (they were assumed drowned) and they (allowed to) marry their wives.  And there was another case in Asya (a place) with one they lowered into the sea, and all that was raised into their hands was his leg, the Chachamim said, from the knee up (his wife) may marry (it was assumed fatal so he would not have gotten out of the sea).  From the knee down, she may not marry.", 
        "Even if he heard woman say, so-and-so died, it is enough (that the man may go testify that he died).  Rabi Yehuda says, even if he heard from children saying, behold we are going to eulogize and bury so-and-so.  Whether he intends (to testify by saying this) or doesn’t intend.  Rabi Yehuda ben Bava says, for a yisra’el, until he intends, for a goy, if he intends, his testimony isn’t testimony.", 
        "One may testify (even if they only saw) by the light of a candle and by the light of the moon, and they may marry even based on an unsourced voice (the one testifying does not know who said that so-and-so died, but heard it).  There was a case of one who stood on top of a mountain and said, so-and-so the son of so-and-so from such-and-such a place died.  They went (to the mountain) and didn’t find anyone there, but they married his wife.  And there was another case in Tzalmon with one who said, I so-and-so the son of so-and-so was bitten by a snake and behold I am dying, and they went and didn’t recognize hi, but they married his wife.", 
        "Rabi Akiva said, when I went down to Neharda’a to make a leap year I found Nechemia a man of the house of Dli, and he said to me, I heard that they do not marry a woman in Israel based on one witness, except for Rabi Yehuda ben Bava.  I said to him, these words are correct.  He said to me, tell them in my name, you know that the country is overrun with troops (so the man could not travel to testify) I received from the elder Raban Gamliel that you marry a woman based on one witness.  And when I came and related the words before Raban Gamliel he was happy for my words and said, I found a friend for Rabi Yehuda ben Bava.  During the conversation Raban Gamliel remembered that people were killed in Tel Arza, and the elder Raban Gamliel married their wives based on one witness, and they established to marry based on one witness.  And they established to marry (based on) a witness from the saying of another witness, from a slave, from a woman, and from a maidservant.  Rabi Eliezer and Rabi Yehoshua say, we do not marry a woman based on one witness.  Rabi Akiva says, not based on a woman, based on a slave, based on a maidservant, or based on relatives.  They said to him, there was a case where some levi’im went to Tzo’ar the city of dates  and one of them got sick on the way, they brought him to an inn, and on their way back they said to the innkeeper, where is our friend?  She said to them, he died and I buried him, and they married his wife.  They said to him, and shouldn’t a kohenet be (trusted) like the innkeeper?  He said to them, when the innkeeper is believed, the innkeeper brought out his staff, his bag, and the safer torah which was in his hands."
