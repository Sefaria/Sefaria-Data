        "If the anointed kohen (a kohen gadol who was initiated with the oil of anointing) instructs himself (wrongly) unintentionally, and did unintentionally (following the decision he made), he brings a bull (as a korban).  (If he decided wrongly) unintentionally and did (something wrong) intentionally (his action was independent of his wrong decision), or (decided) intentionally and did unintentionally, he’s patur, for the instruction of an anointed kohen for himself is like a instruction of the court for the public.", 
        "If he instructed for himself and acted by himself, he atones for himself alone.  If he instructed with the public and did with the public, he atones for himself with the public, for a court is not chayav until they instruct to annul part and to uphold part (of a law), and so to the one who is anointed (a kohen gadol).  And (the instructing body is) not (chayav) in avoda zara (as well) until the instruct to annul part and to uphold part.", 
        "They are not chayav other than a disappearing (forgetting) of a thing with an action done unintentionally (based on the instruction), and so the anointed one.  And not (only there, also) in avoda zara, they are not chayav except on the disappearing of a thing with an unintentional act.  The court is not chayav until they instruct (wrongly) about a thing which its intentional (transgression is punished) with karet and its unintentional (transgression is punished) with a chatat, and so too for the anointed one.  And not (only there, also) with avoda zara, until they instruct about a thing which intentionally (transgressing is punished with) karet and unintentionally (transgressing is punished) with a chatat.", 
        "They are not chayav for an ase (positive mitzva) or lo ta’ase (prohibition) which is (fulfilled) in the Beit Hamikdash, and they do not bring an asham talu’i (a guilt offering brought by one who has a doubt if he transgressed or not) for an ase or lo ta’ase in the Beit Hamikdash.  But they are chayav for an ase and a lo ta’ase by nidda, and one brings a asham talu’i on an ase or a lo ta’ase which is in nidda.  Which is a mitzvat ase by nidda?  (The commandment to) separate from a nidda (menstruant).  And a mitzvat lo ta’ase?  Do not sleep with a nidda.", 
        "One is not chayav on (improper instruction with regard to) the hearing of the voice (forcing testimony), the saying of the lips (oaths), or the tuma of the Beit Hamikdash or its holy things, and the nasi (if the ruler instructs improperly in these matters, he is not chayav), according to Rabi Yossi Hagelili.  Rabi Akiva says, the nasi is chayav in all of them except for the hearing of the voice, for the kind does not judge and is not judged, he does not testify and people do not testify about him.", 
        "All the mitzvot in the torah that one (who transgresses) intentionally is chayav karet and unintentionally a chatat, an individual brings a sheep or a goat (to atone) , the nasi, a goat, and the anointed one or a court bring a bull.  By avoda zara, the individual, the nasi, and the anointed one bring a goat, and the court (brings) a goat and a bull, the bull for an olah (burnt offering) and the goat for a chatat.", 
        "An asham talu’i, an individual and the nasi are chayav, and the anointed one and the court are patur (they would bring a bull for instructing wrongly).  A certain asham, the individual, nasi, and anointed one are chayav, and the court is patur.  For (matters of) the hearing of the voice, the speaking of the lips, and the tuma of the Beit Hamikdash and its holy things, the court is patur, and the individual, the nasi, and the anointed one are chayav, except the kohen gadol is not chayav for the tuma of the Beit Hakidash and its holy thing, according to Rabi Shimon.  And what do they bring?  A graded korban (which is based on what the person can afford).  Rabi Eliezer says, the nasi brings a goat (for he should always be able to afford it)."
