        "The dealing (application) of kefel restitution (double the principle is paid when someone steals) is greater than the dealing of the restitution of four or five (which is used in specific cases listed below), for the dealing of kefel restitution is done whether with something which has the spirit of life or with something that does not have the spirit of life, but the dealing of restitution of four or five is only done with an ox or sheep, as it says, “if a man shall steal an ox or sheep and slaughter it or sell it etc. (he shall pay four for the ox and five for the sheep).”  One who steals after it was stolen (from the thief) does not pay the restitution of kefel, and one who slaughters or sells after the (first person) steals doesn’t pay the restitution of four or five.", 
        "If he stole based on (the testimony) two (witnesses) and slaughtered or sold based on them, or based on two others, he pays the restitution of four or five.  If he stole and sold on Shabbat; stole and sold to avoda zara (idolatry); stole and slaughtered on Yom Hakippurim; stole from his father’s (property), sold, and then his father died; or stole, slaughtered, and then made hekdesh, he pays the restitution of four or five.  If he stole and slaughtered for medicine or dogs, (stole,) slaughtered, and found to be a trefa (have internal tears making it not kosher), or slaughtered chulin (non-holy meat) in the courtyard (of the Beit Hamikdash), he pays restitution of four or five.  Rabi Shimon exempts (from the restitution) in these (last) two cases.", 
        "If he stole based on (the testimony) two (witnesses) and slaughtered or sold based on them, and they were found to be zomemim (conspiring witnesses falsifying testimony whose punishment is what they intended to have done to the other), they pay everything.  If he stole based on two and slaughtered or sold based on two others, and both were found to be zomemim, the first pay restitution of kefel and the last pay restitution of three.  If (only) the last were found to be zomemim, he pays restitution of kefel and they pay restitution of three.  If one of the last was found to be a zomem, the testimony of the other is null.  If one of the first was found to be a zomem, the all of the testimony is null, for is he did not steal it, there is no (way he could have done) slaughtering and no selling.", 
        "If he stole based on two and slaughtered or sold based on one witness, or based on himself (his own admission, which always exempts one from fines) he pays the restitution of kefel, and he does not pay the restitution of four and five.  If he stole and slaughtered on Shabbat; stole and slaughtered to avoda zara; stole from his father’s (property), his father died, and then sold; or stole, made hekdesh, and then, slaughtered or sold, he pays the restitution of kefel, but he does not par the restitution of four or five.  Rabi Shimon says, holy things (which he made holy) which he is chayav for their responsibility (must safeguard them), he pays the restitution of four or five, and those which his is not chayav for their responsibility, he’s patur.", 
        "If he sold less than one hundredth of it, had a partnership in (ownership of) it, slaughtered it and it spoiled (improper slaughtering) while in his hands, he pierced it (as a means of killing it), or let it loose (cut the wind pipe improperly), he pays the restitution of kefel, but does note pay the restitution of four or five.  If he stole it from the domain of the owners and slaughtered or sold it outside their domain, stole it from outside their domain and slaughtered or sold it in their domain, or stole and slaughtered or sold it outside of their domain, he pays the restitution of four or five, but if he stole and slaughtered or sold it in their domain, he is exempt (from the restitution of four or five.)", 
        "If he was pulling it and going out (of the domain of the owner in the process of stealing it) and it died in the property of the owners, he is patur (from kefel).  If he picked it up (an act of acquisition) of he took it out of the domain of the owners and it died, he’s chayav.  If he gave it for the first born of his son (to redeem his first born son), to his creditor, to an unpaid guardian, to a borrower, to one (a guardian) who takes money, or to a renter, and he (the one the thief turned it over to) was pulling it, but it died in the domain of the owners, he’s patur.  If he lifted it up or took it out from the domain of the owners and it died, he’s chayav.", 
        "One may not raise a thin animal (flock) in Israel (for they eat crops which takes away from settling the land), but one may raise them in Syria and in the deserts in Israel.  One may not raise chickens in Yerushalayim, because of the holy (sacrifices, for they may peck at impure things and defile the sacrifices), and kohanim (may) not (raise chickens) in Israel, because of teharot (holy foods).  One may not raise pigs in any place.  One may not raise a god, unless it was tied by a chain.  One does not set a net for doves unless he was more than thirty ris away from settled areas (for he may be taking doves which belong to someone)."
