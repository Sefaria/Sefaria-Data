        "There is an important principle they said about shvi’it, anything designated as human food, one does not make clotters out of it, or needless to say, for animals.  Whatever is not designated as human food, one may make a clotter out of it, but not for animals.  And anything which is not designated for human food or fodder is thought of as human and animal food, and gets the same stringencies.  If he intended to use it as wood, it is wood, like savory, hyssop, and thyme.", 
        "Shvi’it can be given for food, drink, or salve.  To eat what is normally eaten, and to make a salve from what is normally made into a salve.  One may not make wine or vinegar into a salve, but one use oil.  So too with truma and ma’aser sheni.  Shvi’it is even less stringent, because you can use oil to light candles.", 
        "One may not sell shvi’it produce by measure, weight, or number, nor figs by number, nor vegetables by weight.  Beit Shamay says, also not in bundles.  Beit Hillel says, things that are usually bundled at home, one my bundle at the shuk, as in leeks and milkweed.", 
        "One who says to a laborer, here is an issar (an amount of money), collect vegetables for me today, he may hire him.  If he said, collect vegetables for me on account of this money, he may not hire him.  If one took a loaf from a baker worth a pundyon and said, when I have gathered vegetables of the field I’ll bring them for you, it’s mutar.  If he just took from him, he may not pay from the proceeds of shvi’it, for one doesn’t fulfill a debt with shvi’it funds.", 
        "One may not give (proceeds of shvi’it as payment) to a well-digger, a bath attendant, a barber, or a sailor, but you may give to the digger of a well used for drinking.  And he can give to them all as a free gift.", 
        "Figs of shvi’it, one may not lay them out on a drying floor, but one may lay them out on an empty site.  One may not stomp on grapes in a winepress, but one may stomp in a kneading-though.  And one may not process olives in an olive press or crusher, but he may crush them and put them in a small press.  Rabi Shimon says, he may even grind them in an olive press and put them in a small olive press.", 
        "One may not cook shvi’it produce in truma oil, so that it won’t come to be pasul.  Rabi Shimon allows it.  The last thing in a string of trades gets the shvi’it requirements, and the produce itself (that was from shvi’it) is assur.", 
        "One may not buy slaves, land, or non-kosher animals with shvi’it proceeds, but if he did, he must buy food of equal value and treat it as shvi’it.  One may not bring a bird offering as a zav, zava, or child-bearer using proceeds of shvi’it, but if they took he buys food of equal value and treats it as shvi’it.  One may not oil vessels with oil of shvi’it, but if he did, he buys food of equal value and treats it as shvi’it.", 
        "Leather that has been oiled with shvi’it oil, Rabi Eliezer says burn it, Chachamim say, he buys food of equal value and treats it as shvi’it.  They said before Rabi Akiva, Rabi Eliezer used to say, leather that has been burned with shvi’it oil must be burned.  He said to them, be quiet!  I won’t tell you what Rabi Eliezer said about this.", 
        "They also said before him, Rabi Eliezer used to say, one who eats the bread of cutim is as if he ate pork.  He said to them, be quiet!  I won’t tell you what Rabi Eliezer said about this.", 
        "Bath water that has been warmed using hay or straw of shvi’it, one is allowed to wash in it.  But if he is a distinguished person, he won’t bathe in it."
