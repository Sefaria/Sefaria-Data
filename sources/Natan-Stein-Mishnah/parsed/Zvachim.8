        "All zvachim which are mixed up with a chatat left to die (for it was invalid but cannot be benefited from), or with an ox to be stoned, even if one (of those) mixed in with a ribo (ten thousand zvachim), they all die.  If it got mixed up with a with which a transgression has been done or which killed a person based on (the testimony of) one witness or the owner, a rove’a (animal a woman had sex with), nirba (which a man had sex with), one designated (for avoda zara), one worshipped (for avoda zara), one used to pay a prostitute, one worth the value of a dog, one of mixed breed, a trefa, or one born through Caesarian section (all of which are unfit for sacrifice), they graze until they become blemished, are sold, and he shall bring with its money (from selling it), the nicest of its kind (all the animals which were mixed up).  If it was mixed in unblemished chulin, the chulin shall be sold to those in need of that species.", 
        "If holies (got mixed in) holies (belonging to someone else), a type in its (same) type (of sacrifice), this one shall be offered for the sake of someone (unspecified) and that one will be offered for the sake of someone.  Holies in holies (but) a type not in its type, they will graze until they become blemished, will be sold, and with the money of the nicest among them he will bring one (a korban) of that (original) type, and the money of the nicest one he will bring one of that type, and he will lost the excess from his house (his money).  If a bechor (firstborn animal) and ma’aser (of animals) were mixed, they graze until they become blemished, and are eaten as a bechor and ma’aser.  Anything may be mixed other than a chatat or an asham.", 
        "An asham which become mixed with shlamim, they must graze until they become blemished.  Rabi Shimon says, they shall both be slaughtered in the north and eaten as the stricter of them.  They said to him, one does not bring holies to an invalid house (cause things which are valid to become invalid, for he puts more restrictions than necessary on the shlamim).  If pieces (of meat from one) were mixed with pieces (from another), if it was holy of holies in light holies, those that are eaten for one day (were mixed) in those that are eaten for two days, they are eaten like the stricter of them.", 
        "The organs of a chatat which mixed with the organs of and olah, Rabi Eliezer says, he puts them on top and I see the meat of the chatat above it as wood.  Chachamim say, let their shape (appearance) deteriorate and he’ll go out to the place of burning.", 
        "Organs (of an olah) in the organs of those which have blemishes, Rabi Eliezer says, if he offered the head of one of them, all the heads are offered, or the leg of one of them, all the legs are offered.  Chachamim say, they go out to the place of burning.", 
        "Blood which was mixed in with water, if it has the appearance of blood, it is valid (to be sprinkled).  If it (blood) was mixed with wine, they see it (the wine) as if it is water (and evaluate).  If it was mixed with (some other) blood of an animal of the blood of a wild animal, they see it as if it is water.   Rabi Yehuda says, blood does not annul blood.", 
        "If it is mixed with the blood of invalid (korbanot) it is spilled in a water channel (sewer).  With blood for draining (from a bird which is not sprinkled), it is spilled in a water channel.  Rabi Eliezer validates it.  If he did not consult and gave (sprinkled without asking) it is valid.", 
        "If the blood of unblemished (animals was mixed with) the blood of blemished, it is spilled into a water channel.  A cup (of blood was mixed) with (other) cups (of blood), Rabi Eliezer says, if one cup is offered, all the cups are offered.  Chachamim say, eve if they offered all of the other than one of them, it must be spilled in a water channel.", 
        "Those which are given below (on the bottom half of the mizbe’ach) which were mixed in with those given above, Rabi Eliezer says, he gives above, and I see the bottom ones (ones that should be on the bottom) as if they are water, and then he goes back and gives below.  Chachamim say, they should be spilled into a water channel.  An fig he did not consult ad gave, it is valid.", 
        "Those which are given with one giving which mixed in with those which are given one giving will be given one giving.  Four givings with four givings, they are given with four givings.  Four givings with one giving, Rabi Eliezer says, they should be given in four givings.  Rabi Yehoshua says, they should be given in one giving.  Rabi Eliezer said to him, and behold, he is transgressing on (the prohibition of) you shall not diminish (from the mitzvot, for he is only doing on of the four givings for the ones which require four givings).  Rabi Yehoshua said to him, behold, he (with your ruling) is transgressing upon you shall not add.  Rabi Eliezer said to him, you shall not add is not said other than when it is by itself (and not building off a permissible act). Rabi Yehoshua said to him, you shall not diminish is not said other when it is by itself (for the blood requiring one is done properly).  And furthermore Rabi Yehoshua says, when you gave (more than once), you transgressed on you shall not add and you did an act with your hands, but when you didn’t give, you transgressed upon you shall not diminish, but you did not do an action with your hands.", 
        "Yud Those which are given within which were mixed with those given outside, they should be spilled into a water channel.  If he gave outside and then returned and gave inside, it is valid.  (If he gave) inside and returned and gave outside, Rabi Akiva invalidates but Chachamim validate.  For Rabi Akiva would say, all of the blood which entered to atone in the sanctuary are invalid.  Chachamim say, only a chatat.  Rabi Eliezer says, also the asham, as it says, “just as the chatat just as the asham.”", 
        "Yud A chatat which one collected its blood in two cups and one of them went out (of the courtyard making it pasul), the inner one is (still) kasher.  If one of them went inside (the sanctuary), Rabi Yossi Hagelili validates the outer one (which was in the courtyard), but the Chachamim invalidate.  Rabi Yossi Hagelili said, just as a place where thought invalidates, outside (intention while slaughtering to sprinkle outside invalidates the animal), doesn’t make the rest like the (blood which is) leaving (invalid as well), a place where the thought doesn’t invalidate, inside (for such an intention does not invalidate an animal), isn’t it logical that it shouldn’t make the rest like the entering?  If it entered (the sanctuary) to atone, even if it didn’t atone, it is pasul, according to Rabi Eliezer.  Rabi Shimon says, (only) until it atones.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he brought it in accidentally, it is kasher.  All pasul bloods which are given on the mizbe’ach the tzitz (golden head plate of the kohen gadol) does not affect other than the tame, for the tzitz affects (acceptance) for the tame, but is does not affect for that which goes out."
