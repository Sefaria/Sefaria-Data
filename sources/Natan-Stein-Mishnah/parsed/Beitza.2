        "Yom Tov which falls out on erev Shabbat, one may not cook from the outset from Yom Tov for Shabbat.  But, he may cook for Yom tov, and if there was leftover, it was leftover for Shabbat.  And he may make a dish (called an eruv tavshilin) from erev Yom Tov and depend on it (to allow cooking on Yom Tov) for Shabbat.  Beit Shamay says, two dishes, and Beit Hillel says, one dish.  They are the same (in opinion) that a fish and an egg (a popular dish) are two dished.  If he ate it or it was lost, he may not cook based on it from the outset, and if any amount of it is left, he may rely on it for Shabbat.", 
        "If it falls out after Shabbat, Beit Shamay says, everything (vessels and people) immerse before Shabbat, and Beit Hillel says, vessels are immersed before Shabbat, and a person on Shabbat.", 
        "And they are the same (in opinion) that one may put water in a stone vessel (which does not become tame) and do meshika (immersing the vessel until the water in the mikva touches the tame water in the vessel making it tahor), but he may not dip (another type of vessel, because it will become tame from the water and then be immersing a vessel).  And one immerses from one purpose to another (a vessel needs immersion with intention for use with objects of a certain level of holiness) and from one group to another (if changing groups with which he will eat the pesach, he may immerse again).", 
        "Beit Shamay says, one may bring a shlamim but he does not lean his hands on it, but (he may) not (bring) olot (which are not consumed by people).  Beit Hillel says, one may bring shlamim and olot, and even lean his hands on it.", 
        "Beit Shamay says, a person may not heat hot water for his feet unless they are fit for drinking, and Beit Hillel allow.  A person may make a bonfire and warm himself by it.", 
        "In three things Raban Gamliel was stringent according the opinion of Beit Shamay, one may not insulate hot food from Yom Tov for Shabbat, one may not set a menorah up on Yom Tov, and one may not bake breads (on Yom Tov) in large loaves but rather thin rolls.  Raban Gamliel said, in the days of my father’s house they would not bake large loaves but rather thin rolls.  They said to him, what was done in your father’s house, they would be stringent on themselves and lenient on all yisra’el, to bake breads in large loaves and thick cakes.", 
        "Also he says three things to be lenient, one may sweep between beds, on may lay spices (on the fire as a perfumant) on Yom Tov, and one may prepare a mekulas goat (a lamb roasted whole) on the night of Pesach, and the Chachamim forbid.", 
        "Three things Rabi Elazar ben Azarya allows and Chachamim forbid, his cow may go out with a strap between its horns, one may comb an animal on Yom Tov, and one may grind pepper in its mill.  Rabi Yehuda says, one may not comb an animal on Yom Tov since it makes a wound, but one may brush.  And Chachamim say, one may not comb, (and one may) even not brush.", 
        "Pepper mills (can become) tame because of three vessels (which make it up), because of the vessel of receiving, it is a metal vessel (the grinder itself) and because it is a sifting vessel.", 
        "A carriage of a child (can get) tuma of midras (something which is made for sitting and the like which touches the source of tuma), may be carried on Shabbat, and may not be dragged except if over vessels (carpets or clothes).  Rabi Yehuda says, all vessels may not be dragged, except for a cart, since it presses (and doesn’t create furrows as scraping does)."
