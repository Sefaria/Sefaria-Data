        "Egla arufa (when the sages kill a calf in repentance for an unknown corpse found), in Hebrew, as it says, “if a corpse is found on the ground… and the elders shall go out and judge it,” three from the great court which was in Yerushalayim.  Rabi Yehuda says, five, as it says, “your elders,” two, and, “your judges,” two, and there is no balanced court, they add to it one.", 
        "If it is found buried in a heap, hanging in a tree, or floating on the face of the water, they would not break (the calf’s neck), as it says, “on the ground,” and not buried in a heap, “fallen,” and not hanging from a tree, “in the field,” and not floating on the face of the water.  If it was found close to a border, a town which is mostly non-Jews, or a town which does not have a court, they would not break.  They do not measure (the closest city is the source of the calf which has its neck broken) except from a city which has a court.  If it was found equidistant between two cities, they both bring two calves, according to Rabi Eliezer.  And Yerushalayim does not bring an calf.", 
        "If his head was found in one place and his body in another, the carry the head to near the body, according to Rabi Eliezer.  Rabi Akiva says, the body to the head.", 
        "From where would they measure?  Rabi Eliezer says, from his navel.  Rabi Akiva says, from his nose.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, from the place where he was made a corpse (killed), from his neck.", 
        "The elders of Israel became exempt, and left.  The elders of that city would bring, “the calf of cattle which was not work and which did not pull a yoke.”  And a blemish does not invalidate it.  And they lower it to Eitan Valley.  And Eitan is like its meaning, hard (for the rocks were hard there).  Even if it is not hard, it is valid.  And they break it with a hatchet from behind.  And in its place, it is assur to sow and to work (the land), and it is permitted to comb flax there or to chisel stones.", 
        "The elders of that city wash their hands with water in the place of the breaking of the calf’s neck and say, “our hands did not spill this blood and our eyes did not see.”  And did it come up in our minds (did we even think) that the elders of the court are killers?  Rather, that he (the one who died) did not come before us and we sent him away without food, and we did not see him and leave him (to go out to the wilderness) without escort.  And the kohanim say, “atone for your nation Yisra’el which you have redeemed, Hashem, and do not put innocent blood in the midst of your nation Yisra’el.”  They didn’t need to say, “and the blood shall be forgiven for them,” rather the holy spirit (prophecy) informs them, when you do like this (this process), the blood will be forgiven for them.", 
        "If the killer is found before the calf has its neck broken, it goes out and grazes with the herd.  If (the killer was found) after when the calf had its neck broken, it (the calf) should be buried in its place, for it came based on doubt in the first place, it atoned for its doubt and served its purpose.  If the calf had its neck broken and then the killer was found, behold he (the killer) is killed.", 
        "If one witness says, I saw the murderer, and one witness says, you didn’t see, (or) a woman says, I saw, and a woman says, you didn’t see, they would break the neck (for they could not trust that the murder was seen).  If one witness says, I saw and two witnesses say, you didn’t see, they would break the neck.  If two say, we saw, and one says to them, you didn’t see, they would not break the neck (we believe the two).", 
        "When the killers became many, egla arufa was cancelled.  From when Elazar ben Dinai came, and he was called Tchina ben Prisha (he took on an alias), they returned to call him son of the murderer (for he became a known assassin).  When adulterers became many, they stopped the bitter waters (of sota), and Raban Yochanan ben Zakai stopped them, as it says, “I will not remember on your daughters if they become harlots and on your daughters-in-law if they commit adultery, for they etc.” (hinting that if the men are not good enough the waters will not test).  From when Yossi ben Yoezer a person of Tzrar and Yossi ben Yochanan a man of Yerushalayim died, the clusters (referring to people who were exceptional in their torah study and accomplishments) ceased, as is says, “there is no cluster to eat, the first-fruit of which my soul desires.”", 
        "Yochanan the kohen gadol abolished the confession of ma’aser (confirming that one had given it).  He also annulled the me’orerim (levi’im who recited a certain pasuk which he found problematic) and the nokfim (those who stunned animals before korbanot).  Until his days there was a hammer for striking in Yerushalayim.  And in his days, they did not need to ask about dmai (for he proclaimed that only trumat ma’aser and ma’aser sheni had to be taken from dmai, so people did not need to know what had been taken).", 
        "From when the Sanhedrin was abolished, the singing was cancelled from weddings, as it says, “with a song they shall not drink wine.”", 
        "From when the early nevi’im died, the urim vetumim (jeweled golden breastplate with a parchment of holy writing folded inside it which could be consulted to get a message from Hashem) was voided.  From when the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed, the shamir (a creature used to cut through stone in making the Beit Hamikdash) and the nofet tzufim (a certain type of choice honey) ceased and the man of belief (in Hashem, for they now relied on only themselves) stopped, as it says, “save (us) Hashem for the pious has finished etc.”  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabi Yehoshua, from the day the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed, there is no day on which there is no curse, the dew has not come down for blessing, and the flavor of fruits has been removed.  Rabi Yossi says, also the lushness of fruits has been removed.", 
        "Rabi Shimon ben Elazar says, (the lack) of tahara (ritual purity) removed the taste and the smell (from produce).  Ma’asrot removed the lushness of grain.  Chachamim say, whorishness and witchcraft have removed it all.", 
        "In the war of Vespasian they decreed about the diadems of grooms (that they were not allowed) and the tambourine (that it should not be used in festivals). In the war of Titus they decreed about the diadems of brides and that a person shall not teach his son in Greek.  In the last war (that which caused the destruction) they decreed that a bride should not go our with a canopy into the city.  And our rabbis allowed that a bride should go out under a canopy in the city.", 
        "From when Rabi Meir died, the makers of parables were ended.  From when Ben Azay died, the diligent scholars ended.  From when Ben Zoma died, the expounders ended.  From when Rabi Yehoshua died, goodness left the world.  From when Raban Shimon ben Gamliel died, locust came and problems multiplied.  From when Rabi Elazar ben Azarya died, wealth left from the sages.  From when Rabi Akiva died, honor for the torah ended.  From when Rabi Chanina ben Dosa died, men of (good) deed ended.  From when Rabi Yossi Katnuta died, the pious ended, and why was his name called katnuta (small)?  For he was the smallest among the pious.  From when Raban Yochanan be Zakai died, the splendor of wisdom ended.  From when Raban Gamliel the elder died, honor for the torah ended and tahara and abstinence died.  From when Rabi Yishma’el ben Pavi died, the splendor of kehuna ended.  From when Rabi died, humility and fear of sin ended.  Rabi Pinchas ben Yair says, from when the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed, chaverim (those careful about the laws of purity and tithes) and free people were ashamed, they covered their heads, the men of deeds became lessened, and the men of the arm (might) and tongue triumphed, and there is no one who examines, and no one who asks, and no one who inquires (to step in and fix things).  On whom can we rest?  On our Father in heaven.  Rabi Eliezer Hagadol says, from the day the Beit hamikdash was destroyed, the scholars became like teachers, the teachers like cantors, the cantors like commoners, and the commoners lessened, and there is no one who asks.  On whom can we rest?  On our Father in heaven.  In the footsteps (right before the coming of) the mashiach insolence will increase, expensiveness will sore, the vine will give its fruit but wine will be expensive, the government will turn to heresy, and there is no rebuke, a committee house will be for immorality, the Galil will be destroyed, the Gavlen (Golan) will be barren, the people of the border will travel from city to city and not encamp, the wisdom of the scribes will rot, those who fear sin will be hated, and truth will be absent.  Children will humble elders, and elders will stand before children.  “Son will insult father, daughter will rise against mother, a daughter-in-law (against) her mother-in-law, the enemies of a man are the people of his house.”  The face of the generation is like the face of a dog, a son is not embarrassed from his father, and upon whom can we lean?  On our Father in heaven.  Rabi Pinchas ben Yair says, zealousness leads to cleanliness, cleanliness leads to tahara, tahara leads to abstinence, abstinence leads to holiness, holiness leads to humility, humility leads to fear of sin, fear of sin leads to piety, piety leads to holy spirit, holy spirit leads to the resurrection of the dead, and the resurrection of the dead comes at the hands of Eliyahu mentioned for good, amen."
