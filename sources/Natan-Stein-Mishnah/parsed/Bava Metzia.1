        "Two are holding a cloak, this one says, I found it, and that one says, I found it.  This one says, it is all mine, and that one says, it is all mine.  This one should swear that he does not have any less than half in it, and that should swear that he does not have any less than half in it, and they split it.  This one says, it is all mine, and that one says, it is half mine, the one who says, it is all mine should swear that he has no less than tree parts (quarters) and the one who says it is half mine should swear that he does not have in it less than a quarter,.  This one takes three parts and that one takes a quarter.", 
        "If two were riding on an animal, or one was riding and one was leading, this one says, it is all mine and that one says, it is all mine, this one should swear that he does not have in it less than half and that one should swear that he does not have less than half in it, and they split it.  When they admit or they have witnesses, they split without a swear.", 
        "If he was riding on an animal and said to his friend, give it to me, and he (the friend) took it and said, I merited in it, he merited in it.  If from when he gave it to him he said, I merited in it first, he didn’t say anything.", 
        "If one saw the finding (ownerless property) and fell on it, and another came and held on it, the one who held on it merited it.  If one saw them (people on his property) running after a finding, after a broken (lame) deer, or after young birds which have not flown, and he said, my field acquired it for me, it merited for him.  If the deer was running as normal or if the young birds were flying and he said, my field merited for me, he didn’t say anything.", 
        "The finding of his minor son and daughter, the finding of his Cana’ani slave and maidservant, and the finding of his wife, behold they are his.  The finding of his adult son and daughter, the finding of his Jewish slave or maidservant, the finding of his wife who he divorced even though he did not give her her ktuba, behold these are theirs.", 
        "If he found bills of debt, if there is a deposit of property, he should not return, for the court would collect on them (and we fear the borrower may have already paid), but if there is deposit of property on it, he should return, for the could would not collect on them, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, whether like this or like that (in either case) he should not return, because the court will collect on them.", 
        "If he found the gittin of women, the release of slaves, dispositions of property (such as a will), (bills) of gifts, or receipts (that a man has paid his ktuba), he should not return them, for I say, they were written and he changed his mind not to give them.", 
        "If he found letters of assessment (a court document assessing collateral given by a borrower, letters of food (a statement that a man undertakes the support of his wife’s daughter from a previous husband), documents of chalitza or denying (that a minor orphan girl refuses her betrothal upon becoming an adult), documents of arbitration (affirming that the parties have accepted arbitration), and all the doings of the court, behold this he should return.  If he found a small bag, case, roll of documents, or bundle of documents, behold these he should return (for they were probably on their way to be delivered).  And how many (together) is bundle of documents?  Three tied to each other.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, if (the bundle has documents which reflect) one borrowing from three, he returns to the borrower, if three borrowing from one, he returns to the lender.  If he found a document between his documents and he does not know its nature (who it should belong to, the borrower or lender), it will be left until Eliyahu comes.  If there are with them (his documents) notes of cancellation (of a loan), he should do what is in the note of cancellation."
