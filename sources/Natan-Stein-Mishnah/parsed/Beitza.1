        "An egg which was laid on yom Tov, Beit Shamay says, it may be eaten, and Beit Hillel says, it may not be eaten.  Beit Shamay says, leavening (the amount which is assur to be used on Pesach) is a kzayit and chametz by a drying date, and Beit Hillel says, both a kzayit.", 
        "One who slaughters an animal or fowl on Yom Tov, Beit Shamay says, he may dig with a shovel and cover (the blood), and Beit Hillel says, he shall not slaughter unless he has dirt ready from that day.  And they admit, that if he slaughtered he should dig with a shovel and cover, for ashes of a stove (he can use because) they are considered prepared.", 
        "Beit Shamay says, one may not move a ladder from dovecote (a place where doves live) to dovecote (to gather doves and slaughter on Yom Tov), but he may tip it from opening to opening.  And Beit Hillel allows.  Beit Shamay says, he may not take unless he mixed (up) them that day.  Beit Hillel says, he stands and says, I am taking this and that.", 
        "If he prepared for black and found white, white and found black, (or) two and found three, they are assur.  Three and he found two is mutar.  In the nest and he found before the nest, assur.  But if there are none there other than those, they are mutar.", 
        "Beit Shamay says, one may not remove the shutters (covers of boxes and the like) on Yom Tov (to get to food inside, because it is dismantling).  Beit Hillel says, one may even return.  Beit Shamay says, one may not take a pestle (even) to cut meat on it (for it is primarily used to grind and therefore is muktza), and Beit Hillel allows.  Beit Shamay says, one may not put a hide in a place it will be trampled (even to preserve if, for that is the first part of tanning) and he may not lift it, unless there is a kzayit of meat on it, and Beit Hillel allows.  Beit Shamay says, one may not take a child, lulav, or safer torah into the public domain (on Yom Tov) and Beit Hillel allows.", 
        "Beit Shamay says, one may not take (carry to the kohen) challa or gifts (maâ€™aser and the like) for the kohen on Yom Tov, whether they were lifted out (of the food) yesterday or that day, and Beit Hillel allows.  Beit Shamay told them a gzera shava (a parallel formed based on a repeated word), challa and the gifts are gifts for the kohen and truma is a gift for the kohen, just as one may not take truma, so too one may not take the gifts.  Beit Hillel said to them, no, if you said it by truma which does not need to be lifted out, would you say it by the gifts which have to be lifted out?", 
        "Beit Shamay says, spices may be crushed (on Yom Tov) in a wooden grinder, and salt in a jar with a wooden ladle.  Beit Hillel says, spices are crushed in the usual manned with a stone pestle, and salt with a wooden pestle.", 
        "One who picks over beans on Yom Tov, Beit Shamay says, he picks the food out, and eats.  Beit Hillel says, he picks over as usual from his lap, a basket, or a plate, but not with a plank, sifter, or sieve.  Raban Gamliel says, he even wash and skim (off the bad parts).", 
        "Beit Shamay says, one may not send (gifts) on Yom Toc except food portions.  Beit Hillel says, one may send a live animal and a fowl alive or slaughtered.  He may send wines, oils, fine flours, and beans, but not produce.  And Rabi Shimon allows produce.", 
        "One may send vessels (clothing), whether sewn (ready to be worn) or not sewn, even if it has kilayim, if it is for the purpose of Yom Tov.  But (one may) not (send) a nailed sandal (it may not be worn) or an unsewn shoe.  Rabi Yehuda says, nor a white shoe, for it needs a craftsman (to make it black, which is what they wore).  This is the general rule, whatever one can uses on Yom Tov he may send."
