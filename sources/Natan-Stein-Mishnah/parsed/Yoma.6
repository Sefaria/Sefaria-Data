        "The two goats of Yom Hakippurim their commandment is that they will be equal in appearance, height, and value and bought together.  And even if they are not equal, they are kosher.  If he bought one today and one tomorrow, they’re kosher.  If one of them dies, if it died before the lot (for Hashem or hell), they take a pair for the other, and if it died after the lot, they bring another pair and make a lot on them from the beginning and say, if the one of Hashem died, the one of Hashem here will stand in its stead, and if the one of hell died, the one of hell here will stand in its stead.  And the second will graze until it develops a blemish and will be sold, and its money will fall in with donations, for a public chatat is not left to die.  Rabi Yehuda says, is should be left to die.  And also said Rabi Yehuda, if the blood was spilled, the scapegoat is to die, and if the scapegoat dies, the blood is spilled.", 
        "He came to the scapegoat and placed both his hands on it and confessed.  And he used to say like this, please Hashem, they have done wrong, been negligent, and sinned before you, your nation the house of Yisra’el.  Please by Hashem, atone for their wrongs, negligences, and sins which they have done wrong, been negligent, and sinned before you your nation the house of Yisra’el, as is written in the torah of Moshe your servant, saying, “for on this day He will atone for you to purify you from all of your sins, before Hashem you will become pure.”  And the kohanim and the nation which were standing in the sanctuary when they would hear the pronounced name (of Hashem) which would come out of the mouth of the kohen gadol, they would kneel, bow, and all on their faces and say, blessed is the honored name of His kingship for ever and eternity.", 
        "He would hand it over to who was leading it.  All are fit to lead, but the kohanim gedolim made it fixed to not let a yisra’el lead it.  Rabi Yossi said, once Arsela led it, and he was a yisra’el.", 
        "and they made a ramp for him because of the Babylonians (a nickname for mischievous people) for they would pull his hair and say to him, take and leave, take and leave (they wanted to do away with sin more quickly).  Some notable people from Yerushalayim would take him until the first shack (where people waited to accompany him).  There were ten shacks from Yerushalayim to the cliff, ninety ris, seven and a half (ris) to each mil (2,000 amot).", 
        "At each shack they would say to him, here is food and here is water, and they would escort him from shack to shack, except for the last of them, for they did not get with him to the cliff, rather he would stand from afar and see the deed.", 
        "What would he do?  He divided the crimson thread, half tied to the rock and half tide between its horns, and it pushed it from behind, and it rolls and goes down, and it would not get halfway down the hill before it became many pieces.  He came and sat under the last booth until it got dark.  And from when are his clothes tame?  From when he exits from the wall of Yerushalayim.  Rabi Shimon says, from the time he pushes it from the cliff.", 
        "He came to the bull and goat to be burnt (and had been slaughtered).  He tore them open and removed their sacrificial portions, he put them in a tray and smoked them on the mizbe’ach.  He twisted them around poles and took them out to the place of burning.  And from when is their clothing tame?  From when they exit from the wall of the sanctuary.  Rabi Shimon says, from when the fire has seized (lit) most of them.", 
        "They said to the kohen gadol, the goat has reached the desert.  And from where did they know that the goat reached the desert?  For they set up relay stations who waved with scarves and know that the goat had reached the desert.  Rabi Yehuda said, and didn’t they have a great sign?  From Yerushalayim to the house of Chidudo is three mil, they would go a mil, come back a mil, and wait the time of a mil and they knew the goat had reached the desert.  Rabi Yishma’el says, and didn’t they have another sign?  A thread of crimson was tied on the opening of the entrance to the sanctuary.  And when the goat got the desert the thread would whiten as it says, “if your sins will be like crimson, like snow they will be whitened."
