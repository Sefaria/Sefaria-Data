        "Akavya ben Mehalalel says, look at (these) three things and you won’t come to sin, know where you came from, to where you are going, and before whom you stand to give judgment and accounting.  From where did you come?  From a putrid drop (to get rid of pride).  Where are you going?  To a place of dust, worm, and maggot.  And before whom will you stand to give judgment and accounting?  Before the King of kings, the Holy one blessed be He.", 
        "Rabi Chanina the deputy kohen (gadol) says, pray for the welfare of the rulership, for without the fear of it, man would swallow his friend alive.  Rabi Chanina ben Tradyon says, two who sit and there are no words of torah between them, this is the seating of jesters, as it says, “and in the seating of jesters he did not sit.“  But two who sit together and there are words of torah between them, the shchina is between them, as it says, “then those who fear Hashem will spoke to each other, and Hashem heard and listened, and a book of remembrances was written before Him for those who fear Hashem and consider His name.”  This is only for two, from where do we know that even one who sits and engages in torah that Hashem sets a reward for him?  As it says, “he shall sit alone and be silent, because He has laid it upon him.”", 
        "Rabi Shimon says, three who ate on one table and didn’t say on it words of torah, it is as if the ate from the sacrifices of the dead, as it says, “for all the tables filled with vomit and excrement without any space.”  But three who ate on one table and said on it words of torah, it is as if the ate from Hashem’s table, as it says, “and he spoke to me, this is the table which is before Hashem.”", 
        "Rabi Chanania ben Chachinai says, one who stays up at night, or walks on a road alone, or turns his heart to idleness, behold he transgresses on his own soul.", 
        "Rabi Nechunya ben Hakana says, anyone who accepts upon themselves the yoke of torah, they remove from him the yoke of kingship and the yoke of worldly care, and all who remove from themselves the yoke of torah, they put on him the yoke of kingship and the yoke of worldly care.", 
        "Rabi Chalaphta a person of Kfar Chanania says, ten who sit and engage in torah, the shchina (Divine Presence) rests among them, as it says, “God stands in an assembly of God.”  From where do we know even five?  As it says, “and his band (referring to five) he has based on the earth.”  From where even three?  As it says, “He judges among judges (which are three).”  From where even two?  As it says, “then those who fear Hashem will a person to his friend and Hashem listened and He heard.”  And from where even one?  As it says, “in every place where My name is mentioned, I will come to you and bless you.”", 
        "Rabi Eliezer a person of Bartota says, give Him from what is His, for you and what is yours is His, and so too by David who says, “because from You is everything and from Your hand we have given you.”  Rabi Shimon says, one who is walking on his way and interrupts from his studies and says, how beautiful is this tree, or, how beautiful is this field, the torah holds upon him as if he is liable (to lose) his life.", 
        "Rabi Dostai beRebi Yanai said in the name of Rabi Meir, anyone who forgets one thing of his studies, the torah holds upon him as if he is liable (to lose) his life, as it says, “only guard for yourself and guard your soul very much lest you forget the things which your eyes have seen.”  Could this be even if he studies were too hard for him?  We learn from the torah, “and lest they leave from your heart all the days of your life,” behold he isn’t liable on his life until he sits and removes them from his heart.", 
        "Rabi Chanania ben Dosa says, anyone who fear of sin comes before his intelligence, his intelligence endures, and all whose intelligence comes before their fear of sin, their intelligence doesn’t endure.  He used to say, all whose actions are greater than his intelligence, his intelligence endures, and anyone whose intelligence is greater than his actions, his intelligence endures.", 
        "He used to say, all who the spirit of the creations rests with him, the spirit of Hashem rests with him, and all who the spirit of the creations doesn’t rest with him, the spirit of Hashem doesn’t rest with him.  Rabi Dosa ben Harkinas says, sleep of shacharit (morning), wine of afternoon, children’s talk, and sitting in the bati knesset of amei ha’aretz, remove a person from the world.", 
        "Yud Rabi Elazar of Modin says, one who desecrates holy things, one who hates the holidays, one who shames his friend in public, one who nullifies the covenant of Avraham, and one who interprets the torah not according to halacha, even if he has in his hand torah and good actions, he has not portion in the world to come.", 
        "Yud Rabi Yishma’el says, be swift for those who are older than you, kind to children, and accept every man with happiness.", 
        "Yud Rabi Akiva says, jesting and levity lead to lewdness, tradition is a fence for the torah, ma’asrot are a fence for wealth, vows are a fence for abstinence, and quiet is a fence for wisdom.", 
        "Yud He used to say, cherished is man, for he was created in the image, he has an excessive cherishing (since) he was informed that he was created in the image, as it says, “in the image of Hashem He made man.”  Jews are cherished, for they are called children of Hashem, and they have an excessive cherishing (since) they were informed they were Hashem’s children, as it says, “you are children of Hashem your God.”  Jews are cherished for they were given a precious vessel, and they have an excessive cherishing for they were given a precious vessel from which the world was created, as it says, “for it is a good message I have given you my torah, do not leave it.”", 
        "Tet All is expected, and yet free choice is given,  The world is judged in good, yet all is according to the greatness of the act.", 
        "Tet He used to say, all may be given as a pledge (man is held accountable for everything) and a net is spread over life (there is not escaping it).  The store is open, the storekeeper gives credit, the ledger is open, the hand is writing, and all who wish to borrow should come and borrow, but the debt collectors return always, every day, and collect from a person whether he knows it or not, and they have what to depend, and the judgment is true judgment, and everything is prepared for a banquet.  ", 
        "Yud Rabi Elazar ben Azariah says, if there is not torah there is no consideration, if there is no consideration, there is no torah.  If there is not wisdom, there is not fear, if there is no fear, there is no wisdom.  If there is no understanding, there is no knowledge, if there is no knowledge, there is no understanding.  If there is no flour, there is not torah, if there is no torah, there is no flour.  He used to say, all whose wisdom is greater than his deeds, what is he like?  A tree whose branches are many and its roots are few, and the wind comes and uproots it and turns it on its face, as it says, “for he shall be like a tamarisk in the wilderness, and he shall not see when good comes and he shall dwell in parched places in the desert, a salted land not inhabited.”  But all whose actions are greater than his wisdom, what is he similar to?  Like a tree with few branches and many roots, for even if all of the winds come and blow on it, they don’t move it from its place, as it says, “and it will be like a tree planted on water and on the river it will send out its roots, and it will not fear when heat comes, and its leaves will be fresh and in a year of drought it won’t worry, and it will not stop making fruit.", 
        "Yud Rabi Elazar Chimsa says, kinin (bird korbanot) and the onset of menstruation, they are the body of halacha, but (calculation) of times and gematriya, they are the dishes (which feed) wisdom."
