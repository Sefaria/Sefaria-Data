        "How does one extend (the limits) of a city?  If one house is in (from the line) and on house goes out (of the line), or a turret is in and a turret is out.  If there were ruins ten tfachim high and bridges and mausoleums which have a space to live in, we move out the measurement according to them and we make it like a square board, such that we get the advantage of the corners.", 
        "One gives a city an extra karpef (seventy and two-thirds amot and then begins the measurement of 2,000 amot) according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, they didn’t say a karpef except between two towns, if this has seventy and a bit and that one has seventy and a pit, he can make a karpef for both of them and make them like one.", 
        "And so too three towns in a triangle, if the two outer (farthest) towns have a hundred forty one and a third (to karpefs), the middle one makes the three to be as one.", 
        "One only measures with a rope fifty amot in length, no more and no less.  And one may only measure opposite his heart (they hold the rope at the level of the heart).  If one was measuring and he got to a valley or fence, he absorbs it (ignores the vertical distance by measuring at a different height) and returns to his height.  If one came to a hill, he absorbs it and goes back to his height, as long as he doesn’t exit the limits.  If he can’t absorb it, in this Rabi Dostai bar Rabi Yanay in the name of Rabi Meir, I heard that they bore through them.", 
        "One may not measure unless they are an expert.  If he increased (the measure) in one place and decreased in another, we hold by the place where he increased.  If he increased for one and decreased for another (two measurements were taken and they came out differently) we hold by the larger one.  We even believe a slave or a maidservant when they say, until here is the limit of Shabbat, for the Chachamim didn’t say this to be stringent but rather to be lenient.", 
        "The city (referring to a courtyard) of an individual which was made to be of many and of many which was made to be of an individual, one may not make an eruv for all of it, unless he made what was outside of it (another city) like the city of Chadasha in Yehuda, which has fifty residents (and since they are a suburb of an older city, they make one eruv all together) according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Shimon says, three courtyards of two houses (each, they suffice to be the omitted portion).", 
        "One who was in the east and he said to his son, make an eruv in the west, or was in the west and said, make an eruv in the east, if there is from him to his house 2,000 amot and for the eruv more than that, it is mutar to (walk to) his house and assur to (walk to) his eruv.  If he is 2,000 amot from the eruv and to his house more than that, it’s assur to his house and mutar to his eruv.  One who puts his eruv in the addition to the city, he didn’t do anything.  If he put it outside the limit, even one amah, what he gains (by using the eruv as his ‘station’) he loses (in the opposite direction).", 
        "The people of a big city may walk in all of the small city (when it is entirely within the limits of their city), but the people of the small city can’t walk in all of the big city.  How?  One who was in the large city and put his eruv in the small city, or one who was in of the small city who put his eruv in the big city, he may walk throughout the whole city (even) outside of his 2,000 amot.  Rabi Akiva says, he has only 2,000 amot from the place of his eruv.", 
        "Rabi Akiva said to them, don’t you admit to me that by one who puts his eruv in the west, he only has from his eruv 2,000 amot?  They said to him, when?  When it has no residents, but when it has residents, he may walk all of it and outside his 2,000 amot.  This shows that (a cave’s) inside is lenient compared to on it (for one who puts in the cave has the entire space of the cave for it is fit to be lived in, unlike the top of the cave).  And for the measurer (who doesn’t have an eruv) they said for him 2,000 for even the end of his measurement ends in the cave (and doesn’t include all of it)."
