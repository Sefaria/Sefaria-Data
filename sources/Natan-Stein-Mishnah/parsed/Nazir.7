        "A kohen gadol and a nazir do not become tame for their relatives, but they become tame for a met mitzva (an abandoned corpse).  If they were going on their way and found a met mitzva Rabi Eliezer says, the kohen gadol should become tame and the nazir should not.  Chachamim say, the nazir should become tame and the kohen gadol should not.  Rabi Eliezer said to them, the kohen should become tame, for he does not bring a korban on his tuma (becoming tame), and the nazir should not become tame, for he brings a korban on his tuma.  They said to him, the nazir should become tame, for his kdusha is not and eternal kdusha, and the kohen gadol should not become tame, for his kdusha is an eternal kdusha.", 
        "For which (types of) tumot does the nazir shave?  For a corpse, for a kzayit from a corpse, for a kzayit of netzel (some sort of decomposed corpse matter), for a ladleful of rotten (corpse), for a spinal column, on a skull, on an organ from the living, on an organ from the living that has a sufficient amount of flesh (to be potentially functioning), on half a kav of bones, on half a log of blood, on touching them, on carrying them, and on making a tent with them.  On these the nazir shaves, sprinkles on the third and fifth, it blocks the prior days, and he doesn’t start to count until he becomes tame and brings his korban.", 
        "But on schachot (tree branches which cover both a person and a corpse), pra’ot (things protruding from a fence which cover a person and a corpse), a beit paras (the area around a plowed up grave), the land of (other) nations (lands outside of Israel which require the person to take on more nezirut when he returns), golel (stone places upon a tomb), dofek (the frame of a movable tomb), a revi’it of blood, a tent (which he touched covered a corpse), a rova of bones, vessels which touched the corpse, the days of his counting (towards purity when a metzora), and the days of his confirmed tzara’at, for these a nazir does not shave, he is sprinkled the third and seventh, it does not block the previous, he begins counting immediately, and he has no korban.  They really said, the days of a zav and a zava, and the days of quarantine of metzora, behold these are counted for him (in his period of nezirut).", 
        "Rabi Eliezer said n the name of Rabi Yehoshua, all tuma from the dead which a nazir shaves for it, one is chayav on bringing it into the Beit Hamikdash, and all tuma from the dead which a nazir does not shave for, one is not chayav on bring it into the Beit Hamikdash.  Rabi Meir said, this (things Rabi Yehoshua says one is not chayav for) is no more lenient than sheretz (a class of animals, which do not interrupt nezirut but one is chayav for bringing into the Beit Hamikdash).  Rabi Akiva said, I judged before Rabi Eliezer, just as a bone the size of (a grain of) barley which does not make a person tame in a tent, the nazir shaves for touching it or carrying it, a revi’it of blood which makes a person tame in a tent, shouldn’t it be that a nazir shaves for touching it or carrying it?  He said to me, what is this Akiva, we do not judge here from a kal vechomer.  And when I (Rabi Akiva) came and retold these things before Rabi Yehoshua he said to me, you said well, but this is how they said the halacha."
