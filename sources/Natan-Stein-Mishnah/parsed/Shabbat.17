        "All vessels may be moved on Shabbat, and their doors with them (such as the door of a cupboard), even if they weren’t attached (to the vessel) at the beginning of Shabbat, for they are not like the doors of houses, because they (house doors) are not made ready (to be moved about).", 
        "A person may move a mallet on Shabbat in order to crack open nuts, an axe to cut a pressed fig cake, a saw to saw cheese, a spade to shovel dried figs, a winnowing shovel and a pitchfork to put a child on, the reed and the whorl (a wooden needle used in weaving) to stick (into a potentially dirty or sticky food), a hand needle to take out a thorn (from one’s skin), and (a needle) of sack-maker to open a door (to pick the lock).", 
        "A reed used for (stirring) olives, if it has a knot at its end, it is able to become tame (the knot is seen as a receptacle, making it a vessel), and if not, it doesn’t become tame.  Either way, it may be moved on Shabbat.", 
        "Rabi Yossi says, all vessels may be moved, except for a large saw and the pin of a plow (they have no other use).  All vessels may be need whether for a need or not.  Rabi Nechemia says, one may only move them for a need.", 
        "Any vessel which is moved on Shabbat, its shards may be moved with it, as long as they are doing something productive, (like) the shards of a kneading trough (which can be used to) cover the mouth of a barrel, or glass shards which can be used to cover the mouth of a flask.  Rabi Yehuda says, as long as they do something like their purpose, shards of a kneading trough to pour into them a stiff mass, and shards of glass to pour into them oil.", 
        "A stone which is in a (dried) pumpkin (which weighed it down, allowng it to be used as a bucket), if they fill it and (the stone) doesn’t fall, they may fill, but if not, they may not fill it.  A branch which is tied to a small earthenware bucket, one may fill it on Shabbat.", 
        "A cap for a window (to close it since there were no panes), Rabi Eliezer says, when it is tied and hung up, one may stop with it, and if not, one may not stop with it.  Chachamim say, either way, one may stop with it.", 
        "All covers of vessels which have a handle may be moved on Shabbat.  Rabi Yossi said, what is this talking about?  Covers of land (like a well) but covers of vessels, either way they may be moved on Shabbat."
