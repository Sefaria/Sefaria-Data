        "One who non-Jews took him out or an evil spirit (fit of craziness), he only has four amot (outside of the city limits).  If they return him, it’s as if he never left.  If they brought him to a different city, or they put him in a temporary pen or a guarded pen, Raban Gamliel and Rabi Elazar ben Azariah say, he may walk through all of it.  Rabi Yehoshua and Rabi Akiva say, he only has four amot.  Once they came from Brundisium (a port in Italy) and their boat set out to sea, Raban Gamliel and Rabi Elazar ben Azariah walked all throughout it, and Rabi Yehoshua and Rabi Akiva didn’t mover more than four amot, for they wanted to be strict with themselves.", 
        "Once, they didn’t enter the port by the time it got dark.  They said to Raban Gamliel, can we go down?  He said to them, you are allowed, for I already looked and we were within the limits before it got dark.", 
        "A person who went out (of the limits) with permission (i.e. to testify or save a life) and they said to him, the act (which you set out to do) has already been done, he has 2,000 amot in any direction.  If he was within the limits, it’s as if he never left, for all who go out to save return to their place.", 
        "One who sat on the road (and thought he would stay there for Shabbat) and stood and saw that he was close to the city, since it wasn’t his intention, he may not enter according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, he may enter.  Rabi Yehuda said, once there was a case Rabi Tarfon entered when he hadn’t intended.", 
        "One who slept on the road and didn’t know it had become dark (enough to be considered Shabbat) he has 2,000 amot in any direction according to Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri.  Chachamim say, he only has four amot.  Rabi Eliezer says, (he has four amot) and he is at the center (it is a square of side four amot, not a square with half its side four amot).  Rabi Yehuda says, to whichever direction he wants.  And Rabi Yehuda admits that if he chose for himself, he may not return (on his choice).", 
        "There were two (people) and part of this one’s amot are inside part of that one’s amot they may bring and eat in the middle as long as neither exits from his (amot) and enters those of his friend’s.  If there were three, and the middle is swallowed by the other two (his space is partially enclosed in both of theirs), he may be with them and they may be with him, but the two outer are assur to each other.  Rabi Shimon says, what is this like?  Three courtyards which are open to each other and the public domain, they both mix with the middle one, he is mutar to be with them and they are mutar to be with him, but the outer are assur to each other.", 
        "One who was coming on a road and it darkened for him, and he knows of a tree or a fence, so he said, my Shabbat ‘station’ (the center where an eruv would go) is under it, he said nothing.  If he said it is at its root, he may walk 2,000 amot to its root and then 2,000 to his house, and thus he walks after it darkens 4,000 amot.", 
        "If he doesn’t know (a tree or fence) or ha isn’t an expert in the law, and he said, my Shabbat ‘station’ is in my place, he gets from his place 2,000 amot in any direction.  Round (in a circle, not out as in cardinal directions) according to Rabi Chanina ben Antigonus.  And Chachamim say, square like a square board, so he has the benefit of the corners.", 
        "And this is what they said, a poor person may make an eruv with his feet.  Rabi Meir said, we only have this by a poor person.  Rabi Yehuda says, whether a poor person or a rich person, for they only said to make an eruv on a rich person (so that he will make it on bread in stead of his feet),", 
        "Whoever went out to walk to (on behalf of) a city in which they can make an eruv and his friend turned back, he may go, and all of the people of the city are assur (for he might not have gone) according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Meir says, whoever could have made an eruv but didn’t he is like ‘one riding a donkey and a camel (he may not go anywhere outside of the town limits in the end, because he has no eruv).", 
        "When he went out of the limits, even one amah, he may not enter.  Rabi Eliezer says, two, he may enter but three, he may not.  One who it got dark for outside the limits, even one amah, he may not come in.  Rabi Shimon says, even fifteen amot, he may enter, for the surveyors don’t measure exactly because of those who err (so they will not transgress)."
