        "All substitutes for nezirut are like nezirut.  One who says, ehey (like eheye, I will be), behold this is a nazir.  Or, ehey nave, (he’s a nazir).  Nazik, nazi’ach, pazia’ch, behold he is a nazir.  Behold I am like this, behold I am curling (my hair), behold I am letting my hair grow, behold it is on me to grow my hair, behold these are a nazir.  Behold upon me are birds (a bird korban is brought by a nazir who becomes tame). Rabi Meir says, nazir.  Chachamim say, not a nazir.", 
        "Behold I am a nazir from the (grape) seeds, from the (grape) skins, from shaving, and from tuma, behold this is a nazir, and all the details of nezirut are upon him.  Behold I am like Shimshon (a biblical figure who was a nazir from birth), like the son of Manoach, like the husband of Dlila, like the one who uprooted the doors of Aza, like the one who the Plishtim gouged out his eyes (all referring to Shimshon), behold this is a Shimshon nazir.  What is the difference between an eternal nazir and a Shimshon nazir?  An eternal nazir, if his hair became heavy he may lighten it with a razor and bring three animals (an olah, chatat, and shlamim), and if he became tame he brings a korban for tuma (two birds for a chatat and olah and a lamb as an asham).  A Shimshon nazir if his hair gets heavy, he may not lighten it, and if he became tame he does not bring a korban tuma.", 
        "Unspecified nezirut (a vow in which he did not specify a time) is thirty days.  If he said, behold I am a nazir for one large, a nazir for one small, even (if he declared himself a nazir) from now until the end of the world (none of which actually specify time), he is a nazir for thirty days.  Behold I am a nazir and one day, behold I am a nazir and one hour, behold I am a nazir one and a half, behold he is a nazir for two (thirty day periods).  Behold I am a nazir thirty days and one hour, he is a nazir thirty-one days, that they do not make nezirut for hours.", 
        "Behold I am a nazir like the hair on my head, like the dust of the earth, or like the sand of the sea, behold he is a nazir forever, and he shaves once every thirty days (to signify the beginning of a new period of nezirut).  Rabi says, this one does not shave once every thirty days.  And who is it that shaves once every thirty days?  One who says, behold nezirut is upon me like the hair on my heads, like the dust of the earth, or like the sand of the sea.", 
        "Behold I am a nazir a houseful, or a basketful, they check him, if he said, one large I made a nazir, he is a nazir for thirty days.  If he said I made a nazir unspecified, they see the basket as if it were filled with mustard seed, and he is a nazir all his days.", 
        "I am a nazir from here to such-and-such a place, they evaluate how many days (the journey is) from here to such-and-such a place.  If it is less than thirty days, he is a nazir fro thirty days.  If not, he is a nazir like the number of days.", 
        "Behold I am a nazir like the number of the days of the sun (one solar year) he counts his nezirut (thirty day periods) like the number of the days of the sun.  Rabi Yehuda said, there was a case, and when he completed (all of them) he died."
