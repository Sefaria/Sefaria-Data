        "Beit Shamay says, hekdesh made in error is hekdesh, and Beit Hillel says it isn’t hekdesh.  How?  He said, the black ox that comes out of my house first is hekdesh and a white one came out, Beit Shamay says it’s hekdesh, and Beit Hillel says it isn’t hekdesh.", 
        "The golden dinar that comes up to my hand first, behold it is hekdesh, and a silver one came up, Beit Shamay says it’s hekdesh and Beit Hillel says it isn’t hekdesh.  The barrel of wine that will come up to my hand first, behold it is hekdesh, and one of oil came up, Beit Shamay says, hekdesh, and beit Hillel says, it isn’t hekdesh.", 
        "One who vowed to be a nazir and asked a sage (to find an out) and (the sage) bound him, he counts (his term of nezirut) from the time he vowed.  If he asked as sage and he unbound him, if he had a separated animal, it goes out and grazes with the flock.  Beit Hillel said to Beit Shamay, don’t you agree with this that is hekdesh in error, that it goes out to graze with the flock (meaning it isn’t hekdesh)?  Beit Shamay said to them, don’t you admit (by ma’aser behema, where every tenth animal is made ma’aser) by one who erred and made the ninth (animal in line) the tenth (for the animals were counted by passing through a small gate and being marked every ten), the tenth the ninth, and eleventh the tenth, that it is hekdesh (even though it was the wring animal)?  Beit Hillel said to them, it was not the rod (used to designate the tenth which made them hekdesh.  And what if he erred and rested the rod on the eighth or on the twelfth, did he perhaps do something?  Rather the pasuk that made the tenth hekdesh made the ninth and the eleventh hekdesh (they are not hekdesh because they were made hekdesh in error, but rather because a pasuk comes to include them).", 
        "One who made a vow to be a nazir and went to bring his animal (as a korban) and found it was stolen, if before his animals were stolen he became a nazir, behold he is a nazir, but if after his animals were stolen he became a nazir, he isn’t a nazir.  And this is a mistake that Nachum Hamadi made, when nezirim came from outside Israel and found the Beit Hamikdash destroyed, Nachum Hamadi, if you knew the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed would you have become nezirim?  They said, no, and Nachum Hamadi unbound them.  And when the thing came to the Chachamim they said to him, all who became nezirim before the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed are nezirim, and (those who became nezirim) from when the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed, are not nezirim.", 
        "They (six people) were going on their way, and one came toward them.  One of them said, behold I am a nazir if this is so-and-so; one said, behold I am a nazir if this is not so-and-so; (one said,) behold I am a nazir that one of you (the first two) is a nazir; (behold I am a nazir) if not one of you (the first two) is a nazir; that both of you are nezirim; that you are nezirim.  Beit Shamay says, they are all nezirim (for he holds that this was a vow made with an erroneous condition is invalid).  Beit Hillel says, one is not a nazir unless his words were fulfilled.  Rabi Tarfon says, not one of them is a nazir (for none of their vows were sure at the time they were made).", 
        "If he (the person coming towards them) turned around, he (any of them) is not a nazir.  Rabi Shimon says, he should say, if it was like my words, behold I am an obligatory nazir, and if not, behold I am an optional nazir.", 
        "One (group of nine people) who saw a koy (an animal which has characteristics of both chayot and behemot) and said, behold I am a nazir that (if) this is a chaya (wild animal), (another one says) behold I am a nazir that this isn’t a chaya, behold I am a nazir that this is a behema (domesticated animal), behold I am a nazir that this isn’t a behema, behold I am a nazir tat this is a chaya and a behema, behold I am a nazir that this is neither a chaya nor a behema, behold I am a nazir that one of you is a nazir, behold I am a nazir that not one of you is a nazir, behold I am a nazir that you are all nezirim, behold they are all nezirim."
