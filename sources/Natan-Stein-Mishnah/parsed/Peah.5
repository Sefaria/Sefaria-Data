        "A heap that is on top of potential leket, whatever touches the ground is considered leket.  Wind that scattered the bundles, we evaluate how much leket there would normally be in that field and give that to the poor.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says he gives how much that amount would normally produce in leket.", 
        "A stalk still attached to the ground that is surrounded by harvested space, if it’s close enough to other unharvested stalks, it is the owners, if not, it is for the poor.  If some leket gets mixed in with harvested grain, he takes a stalk for ma’aser and gives it to the poor.  Rabi Eliezer said, how can this poor person exchange something which wasn’t yet his?  He temporarily gives the heap as a gift to the poor person, so he can take ma’aser from it.", 
        "One can not irrigate his field (before leket has been collected, as it will get ruined) according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say you can, because you can (preserve the leket).", 
        "An owner who was traveling and needed to take the gifts for the poor may take, and when he gets home, he’ll pay according to Rabi Eliezer.  Chachamim say, no, he was poor when he took it.", 
        "One who switches with poor people, what he gets is patur from ma’aser, but he has to take ma’aser on what he gives.  Two people who sharecrop can give each other ma’aser ani.  A surf may not take the gifts for the poor.  Rabi Yehuda said, when is this?  When he gets a portion of the crop.  But if he gets a portion of the produce (and has no ownership in the field) he may take.", 
        "One who sells his field may take the gifts, but the buyer may not.  One may not hire workers and have their children collect after them (and therefore give them a lower salary).  One may not prevent the poor from gathering, or prevent one and allow another, or help one of them, for this is stealing from the poor, which we have a pasuk against.", 
        "A bundle that either the owner or the workers, but not both, forgot, or the poor hid it, is not shichicha.", 
        "If a person collects stalks to put into special shaped bundles, and forgot a stalk, this is not shichicha (because it is not the final product).  But if it goes straight to the threshing floor, there is shichicha. If it’s just for a heap, he can have shichicha, but moving the heap to the threshing floor, there is no shichicha.  This is the when you collect for the place that is the final product, there is shichicha, and from there to the threshing floor, there is no shichicha.  When it’s to a place where it’s not the final product, there is no shichicha, and from the there to the threshing floor, there is shichicha."
