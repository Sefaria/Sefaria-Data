        "If one bends a vine into the ground (to make runners), if there are less than three tfachim of dirt on the covered part, he may not sow on it, even if he pressed it into a gourd or pipe (underground).  If he bends it into a rock, even though it doesn’t have three tfachim of soil, he may plant above it.  A vine that forms a “knee” when it emerges has its six tfachim measured from the top of the knee (for it might bend away from the stalk, and define a different area).", 
        "One who makes runners from three vines and their roots are visible, Rabi Elazar bar Tzadok says, if there are four to eight amot between them, they combine, and if not, they don’t.  A dried vine if forbidden to sow near, but doesn’t make kilayim.  Rabi Meir says, so too cotton can’t be sown next to but doesn’t make kilayim.  Rabi Elazar bar Tzadok says in the name of Rabi Meir, also above a vine is forbidden to sow, but it doesn’t make kilayim.", 
        "These things can’t be planted near, but don’t leftovers from a destroyed vineyard, the leftovers of the machol of a vineyard, the leftover of gaps in an aris, the remainder of a trellis.  But under a vine, the vine’s tillage space, and four amot in a vineyard, these do make kilayim.", 
        "One who causes his vine to grow over his neighbor’s grain, he made it kilayim and is liable for damages.  Rabi Yossi and Rabi Shimon say, one can not make something that isn’t his assur as kilayim.", 
        "Rabi Yossi said, once someone sowed in his vineyard during shmitta, and the case came before Rabi Akiva, who said, one cannot make something which isn’t his assur as kilayim.", 
        "An intruder who sowed a vineyard, and the owner got it back, he cuts down the grain even on chag.  Up to how much extra must he pay in order to find laborers to cut it?  Up to a third.  If they would want more than that, he cuts it down as he usually would, even after the chag.  From when is it considered a violent intruder?  From when the owner is forgotten, meaning the intruder had possession, made assur kilayim, and made it a necessity worth paying extra to remove.", 
        "A wind that blows vines on top of grain, he must immediately make a fence (so that the vines will no longer overhang).  If it was an unavoidable circumstance (ones) it’s mutar.  Grain that bent under vines, and so too with vegetables, he straightens it and it isn’t assur.  From when does grain become assur?  From when it strikes roots.  What about grapes?  When they grow to the size of white beans.  Fully dried grain or fully ripened grapes do not become assur.", 
        "A pot with a hole makes kilayim in a vineyard, and one that doesn’t have a hole doesn’t.  Rabi Shimon says, both of these can’t be planted near but don’t make assur.  If one carries a pot with a hole through a vineyard, if it increased in size by a two-hundredth, it’s assur."
