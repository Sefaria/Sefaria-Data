        "One who wounds his friend is chayav on it for five things, damage, pain, treatment, sitting (lost wages), and embarrassment.  For damage, how (do we assess it)?  If he blinded his eye, cut off his hand, or broke his foot, that see him a if he is a slave being sold in the shuk (market), and asses how much he was worth and how much he is worth (now with the wound). (How do we assess) pain?  If he burned him with a (hot) spit or nail, even on his fingernail in a place where he does not make a wound, we assess how much (money) a person like this would take to (agree to) be in that in pain like that.  Treatment?  If he hit him, he is obligated to treat him.  If growths came on it, if it is a result of the blow, he’s chayav, that which is not a result of the blow, he’s patur.  If it healed and then opened up, healed and then opened up, he is chayav to treat him.  Sitting?  We see him as if he is a guard of (a field of) squashes (and give him that wage) for he has already paid him for his hand and his foot (for that type of work can be done even by an amputee).  Embarrassment?  All is according to the one embarrassing and the one embarrassed.  If he embarrasses a naked person, embarrasses a blind person, or embarrasses on who is sleeping, he’s chayav, but a sleeping person who embarrassed is patur.  If he fell from the roof and damaged and embarrassed, he is chayav for the damage and patur for the embarrassment, as it says, “and she sent her hand and held on to is embarrassment,” he is not chayav for embarrassment until he intends for it.", 
        "This is a stringency by a person from an ox, that a person pays damage, pain, treatment, sitting, and embarrassment, and pays money for children if he causes a woman to miscarry), but an ox doesn’t pay except for damage and is patur from the money of children.", 
        "If one hits his father or his mother, and he did not wound them, or wounds his friend on Yom Hakippurim, he is chayav in all of them (the five payments).  One who wounds a Jewish slave is chayav in all of them except for sitting when he (the slave) is his (belongs to the damager, for the loss of work hurts the owner).  One who wounds a Cana’ani slave of others is chayav in all of them.  Rabi Yehuda says, slaves do not have embarrassment (for their status is too low).", 
        "A deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor, hurting them is bad, and one who wounds them is chayav, and those (a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor) who wounded others are patur.  A slave and a woman hurting them is bad, and one who wounds them is chayav, and those who wounded others are patur.  But they pay after time, if the woman got divorced or the slave got freed, they are chayav to pay.", 
        "One who hits his father or mother and wounded them or wounds his friend on Shabbat is patur from all of them since he is judged (punished) with his life (death). And one who wounds his own Cana’ani slave is patur in all of them.", 
        "One who hits his friend in the ear, gives him a sela (for embarrassment).  Rabi Yehuda says in the name of Rabi Yossi Hagelili a maneh.  If he struck him (with a flat hand), he gives him two hundred zuz.  With the back of his hand, he gives him four hundred zuz.  If he slit his ear, plucked his hear, spit and his spit got on him (the friend), removed his cloak from him, or uncovered the hair of a woman in the shuk, he gives four hundred zuz.  This is the general rule, all goes according to his honor.  Rabi Akiva said, even the poor people who are in yisra’el (Jews) we see them as if they are freedmen who went down from their property (impoverished noblemen) for they are the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya’akov.  And there was a case where one uncovered the head of a woman in the shuk, she came before Rabi Akiva, and he obligated him to pay her four hundred zuz.  He said to him, Rabi, give me time, and he gave him time.  He guarded (watched) her (when she was) standing at the opening of her courtyard, he broke a jug before her, and there was an issar’s worth of oil in it (a small amount), she uncovered her head, palmed it (got the oil on her hand), and rested her hand on her head (to oil her hair).  He stood (arranged) witnesses for (to testify about) her and came before Rabi Akiva.  He said, to this one I am giving four hundred zuz (she showed that she did not particularly care to have her head uncovered)?  He said to him, you have said nothing, (for) one who wounds himself, even though he has not right, he’s patur, but others who wounded him are chayav.  And one who cuts down his plants, even though he has no right, is patur, but others who cut down his plants are chayav.", 
        "Even though he (one who wounds his friend) give him (compensation) he is not forgiven by him until he asks from him, as it says, “and now return the wife of etc. (a case where Avimelech had repented, but Hashem told him to go to Avraham to get cured).”  And from where (do we learn) that the one forgiving should not be cruel?  As it says, “and Avraham prayed to God and God healed Avimelech etc.”  One who says, blind my eye, cut off my hand, or break my foot (if the person does it), he’s chayav.  (If the person adds,) on condition that you are patur, he’s chayav.  Rip my clothes, break my jug, he’s chayav.  On condition that you are patur, he’s patur.  Do so to such-and-such a person, on condition that you are patur, he’s chayav whether to his person or his money."
