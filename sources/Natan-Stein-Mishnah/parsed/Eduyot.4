        "These are things from the leniencies of Beit Shamay and the stringencies of Beit Hillel.  An egg which was laid on Yom Tov, Beit Shamay says it may be eaten, and Beit Hillel says it may not be eaten.  Beit Shamay says, leavening (the amount which is assur to be used on Pesach) is a kzayit and chametz by a drying date, and Beit Hillel says, both a kzayit.", 
        "An animal born on Yom Tov, all agree that it is mutar.  And a chick which hatched from an egg, all agree that it is assur.  One who slaughters an animal or fowl on Yom Tov, Beit Shamay says, he may dig with a shovel and cover (the blood), and Beit Hillel says, he shall not slaughter unless he has dirt ready from that day.  And they admit, that if he slaughtered he should dig with a shovel and cover, for ashes of a stove (he can use because) they are considered prepared.", 
        "Beit Shamay says if you make something hefker for the poor, it’s hefker.  Beit Hillel says it’s only hefker if you make it even for rich people, like shmitta.  If all of the bundles are a kav and one is four kabim and you forget it, Beit Shamay says it’s not shichicha, and Beit Hillel says it is.", 
        "A heap close to an uncemented wall, a pile of grain, cattle, vessels, and he forgot it, Beit Shamay says it isn’t shichicha and Beit Hillel says it is.", 
        "Kerem revai (a vineyard in its fourth year), Beit Shamay says, it has no chomesh (a fifth added to produce which needs to be eaten in Yerushalayim redeemed on money) and it has not biur (removal from the house in the shmitta year after the produce goes out of season).  Beit Hillel says, It has chomesh and it has biur.  Beit Shamay says, it has peret (grapes which fell from the vine go to the poor) and olelet (clusters which are not fully developed are left for the poor), and the poor redeem for themselves (what they collected on money) and Beit Hillel says, it all goes to the winepress.", 
        "A barrel of pickled olives, Beit Shamay says, he doesn’t have to make a hole (to let the brine flow out, showing its unimportance such that it will not make the olives tame) and Beit Hillel says, he needs to make a hole.  And they agree that if he made a hole and the dregs stopped it, it is tahor.  One who anoints (rubs his skin with) tahor oil and becomes tame, and went down and immersed, Beit Shamay says, even thought it (the oil) still drips off of him it is tahor and Beit Hillel says, (it is tahor only if there is only enough) to anoint a small limb (the pinky).  And if the oil was tame from the start, Beit Shamay says, enough to anoint a small limb, and Beit Hillel says, a moist liquid (if there is enough for a person’s hand to feel moist when that much is rubbed on it).  Rabi Yehuda says in the name of Beit Hillel it is moist and makes moist.", 
        "A woman can be engaged by a dinar or the value of a dinar, according to Beit Shamay and Beit Hillel say with a pruta or the value of a pruta.  And how much is a pruta?  One eighth of an Italian issar.  Beit Shamay says, he dismisses his wife with an old get, and Beit Hillel forbids it.  What is an old get?  All which he was alone with her after it (the get) was written for her.  One who divorces his wife and she stays with him in an in, Beit Shamay says, she does not need a second get from him, and Beit Hillel says, she needs a second get from him.  When?  When they divorced from marriage, but if the divorced from engagement she doesn’t need a second get from him for he is not haughty (presumptuous) with him.", 
        "Beit Shamay allows the rivals (of the prohibited women) to the brothers (for yibum or chalitza), and Beit Hillel prohibits.  If they did chalitza, Beit Shamay makes invalid for marrying kohanim (who may not marry a chalitza), and Beit Hillel makes valid (for their chalitza was invalid).  If they did yibum, Beit Shamay validates and Beit Hillel invalidates.  Even though these (Beit Hillel) prohibit (yibum to rivals) and these (Beit Shamay) allow, these (Beit Shamay) invalidate (for marriage after such a yibum) and these (Beit Hillel) validate, Beit Shamay did not refrain from marrying the women of Beit Hillel, and Beit Hillel did not refrain from marrying the women of Beit Shamay.  All (matters of) tahor and tame (by vessels) that these would make tahor and these would make tame they did not refrain from making teharot based on them (they would trust that the other group would only lend them vessels which the borrowers themselves would consider tahor, even though the lender might not agree with the other’s views).", 
        "Three brothers, two of them are married to two sisters, and the third is unmarried.  One of those married to the sisters died, and the unmarried one married her by a ma’amar (monetarily or by document without consummating the marriage) and then the other died, Beit Shamay says, his wife is with him and that one will be exempt because of (the fact that she is) the sister of his wife.  Beit Hillel says, he removes his wife with a get (because she is forbidden as the sister of a zkuka, one who needs yibum) and chalitza, and the sister of his brother with chalitza.  This is what they said, woe to him on his wife and woe to him on his brother’s wife.", 
        "One who vows (against) his wife (meaning) having sex (with her), Beit Shamay says, two weeks (after which the husband must divorce her and pay her ktuba).  Beit Hillel says one week.  One who miscarried the night of the eighty-first (day), Beit Shamay exempt from a korban and Beit Hillel require.  A linen cloak with tzitzit, Beit Shamay exempt and Beit Hillel require.  A large basket for Shabbat (which one wants to snack from before Shabbat), Beit Shamay holds it’s patur, and Beit Hillel hold it’s chayav.", 
        "One who vowed for an extended nezirut (a vow against certain impurities which he extended beyond the thirty day minimum) and he finished his nezirut, and afterwards came to Israel (the only place his vow can really be fulfilled), Beit Shamay says, he is a nazir for thirty days (the minimum) and Beit Hillel says he is a nazir from the start.  One who had two groups of witnesses testifying about him, one testifying that he vowed two (thirty day periods) and one testifying that he vowed five, Beit Shamay says, the testimony is divided and there is no nezirut, and Beit Hillel says, two are included in five, he should be a nazir two.", 
        "One who is lying under the crack (in a portico the ceiling of which is completely cracked, and on one side there is a dead body and on the other side there are vessels), Beit Shamay says, he does not bring the tuma (to the vessels, acting as a bridge for the gap) and Beit Hillel says a man is hollow, and the upper side (of the person acts as a tent) and brings the tuma."
