        "Even though they said that a virgin collects two hundred and a widow collects a maneh, if he wants to add even one hundred maneh, he may add.  If she was divorced whether from betrothal or marriage, she collects everything.  Rabi Elazar ben Azaria says, from marriage, she collects it all, from betrothal a virgin collects two hundred and a widow a maneh, for he only wrote it for her in order to marry her.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he wants (to write less) he writes a bill for two hundred and she writes, I received a maneh from you (even though he didn’t pay, she is forgoing one maneh), and for a widow, (we writes) a maneh and she writes, I received from you fifty zuz.  Rabi Meir says, anyone who reduces from two hundred for a virgin or a maneh for a widow, this is whorish intercourse.", 
        "They give a virgin twelve months from when her husband requested (engaged) her to provide (clothes and jewelry for the wedding) for herself.  And just as they give to the woman, so too they give for the man to provide (a wedding reception and the like) for himself.  And for a widow (for she already has clothes and jewelry) thirty days.  If the time came and they didn’t marry, she eats from his (e supports her) and from truma (if he is a kohen).  Rabi Tarfon says, he may give her all truma (though in marriage, when she is unclean he must give her chulin).  Rabi Akiva says, half chulin half truma (as in marriage).", 
        "A yavam (one who is doing yibum) does not feed (allow a woman to eat) truma (if he is a kohen).  If she did six months with her husband and six months with her yavam (if her husband died in the year from engagement to marriage), even all of them with her husband except one day with the yavam or all of them with the yavam except one day with the husband, she may not eat truma.  This (including the cases at the end of the previous mishna) is the first (early) mishna, a court after them said, a woman does not eat truma until she enters under the chupa (marriage canopy).", 
        "One who makes the work of his wife’s hands hekdesh, behold she makes and eats (from her profits, for it is not her husband’s right to make her work hekdesh).  The excess (for she owes him a certain quantity each year in exchange for maintenance, but if he doesn’t provide her with a living stipend, she keeps the surplus), Rabi Meir says (if the husband in this case makes the surplus hekdesh), it is hekdesh.  Rabi Yochanan the sandal maker says, it is chulin (for her use).", 
        "These are the works a woman does for her husband, she grind, bakes, launders, cooks, nurses her child, makes his bed, and works in wool.  If she brings in (to the marriage) one maidservant, she doesn’t grind, bake, or launder.  If two (maidservants), she doesn’t cook or nurse her son (in addition to the tasks she does not do if she brings in one).  Three, she does not make his bed or work in wool.  Four, she sits on a soft cushion (and is a woman of leisure).  Rabi Eliezer says, even if she brings in one hundred maidservants, he may force her to work in wool, for idleness leads to looseness.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, also one who vows against his wife doing work, he exits and gives her her ktuba, for idleness leads to insanity.", 
        "One who vows (against) his wife (meaning) having sex (with her), Beit Shamay says, two weeks (after which the husband must divorce her and pay her ktuba).  Beit Hillel says one week.  Students go out to learn torah without permission (of their wives) for thirty days.  Laborers, one week.  Conjugal rights (which a husband owes his wife) from the torah are, men of leisure every day, laborers twice a week, donkey drivers once a week, camel drivers once every thirty days, sailors once every six months, according to Rabi Eliezer.", 
        "One who rebel against her husband (by refusing to have sex with him), they reduce her ktuba seven dinars each week.  Rabi Yehuda says, seven tarpeiks (half a dinar) each week.  How much does her reduce?  Until according to her ktuba (the entire worth).  Rabi Yossi says, he may go and reduce forever, for perhaps an inheritance will fall to her from some other place, and he will collect from there.  And so to one who rebels against his wife, they add to his ktuba three dinars a week.  Rabi Yehuda says, three tarpeiks.", 
        "One who provide for his wife using a third party may not reduce for her from two kabin of wheat (a week) or four kabin of barley.  Rabi Yossi said, he doesn’t grant her (twice the amount of) barley, only Rabi Yishma’el, for he lived close to Edom (where the barley was of inferior quality).  And he (in addition)gives her half a kav of beans, half a log of oil, a kav of dried figs or (the weight of) a maneh or pressed figs, and if he doesn’t have, he provides her produce from another place (of another variety).  And he gives her abed, mattress, and a mat.  And he gives her a cap for he head, a belt for her waist, shoes from festival to festival, and clothes of (a worth of) fifty zuz a year.  And one does not give her new in the days of the sun  (summer) or worn out in the days of rain (winter), rather he gives her clothes of fifty zuz in the winter and she wears the worn out ones in the summer, and the worn out ones are hers (to keep even when she gets new ones).", 
        "He gives her a ma’ah of silver for her needs, and she eats with him (at least) from Shabbat night to Shabbat night.  And what does she produce for him?  The weight of five sela of warp (longitudinal threads she must weave) in Yehuda, which are ten sela in the Galil (where a sela weighs half as much).  Or a weight of ten sela of woof (latitudinal threads which are thicker) in Yehuda, which are twenty sela in the Galil.  But if she was nursing, they would reduce the work of her hands an add to her maintenance.  What is this talking about?  The poor of Yisra’el, but in those who are honored (rich) all of her work and stipends) go according to his honor (her status is increased as his is)."
