        "One put an onion into lentils, if it’s whole, it is mutar (even though one is truma).  If he cut it up, if it imparts flavor (it’s assur).  In any other cooked dish, whether cut or whole, it’s (assur) if it imparts flavor.  Rabi Yehuda allows (a whole union) in pickled fish, for it is simply used to remove odor (and not for flavor).", 
        "An apple (truma) which one grated into a dough (chulin) and he leavened it, this is assur.  Barley (truma) which fell into a pit of water, even though it tainted the water, it’s mutar.", 
        "One who takes hot bread (chulin) from the oven and puts it on the mouth of a jar of truma wine, Rabi Meir prohibits, and Rabi Yehuda permits.  Rabi Yossi allows by wheat bread, but prohibits by barley, for barley absorbs more.", 
        "An oven which one heated with truma cumin and he baked in it, the bread is allows, for there is not flavor of cumin, only the scent.", 
        "Fenugreek which fell into a vat of wine (chulin) and it was truma or ma’aser sheni, if there is in the seed enough to impart flavor, but not in the stalk (it’s assur).  If it was shvi’it, vineyard kilayim, or hekdesh, if there is in the seed and the stalk enough to impart flavor (it’s assur).", 
        "One who had bundles of fenugreek of vineyard kilayim, he must burn them.  If the fenugreek bundles were of tevel, he pounds them and calculates how much seed there is in them and separate the seed, but he needn’t separate the stalk.  If he did separate, he may not say, I will beat and take the stalks and give the seeds, he must give the stalks with the seeds.", 
        "Chulin olives which one pickled with truma olives, whether crushed chulin with crushed truma or whole truma, or in truma water, it’s assur.  But if it is whole chulin with crushed truma, it’s mutar.", 
        "A tame fish which one pickled with a tahor fish, any vessel which holds two se’ah, if it has a measure of ten zuz in Yehuda, which is five sela in the Galil, of tame fish, the brine is assur.  Rabi Yehuda says, a revi’it in two se’ah (1/192 of the total makes unclean), and Rabi Yossi says, one sixteenth of what is in it.", 
        "Tame locusts which were pickled with tahor locusts, they didn’t forbid the brine.  Rabi Tzadok testified that the brine of tame locusts is tahor.", 
        "All things pickled together are mutar, except leeks, chulin leeks with truma leeks or chulin vegetables with truma leeks are assur.  But chulin leeks with truma vegetables are mutar.", 
        "Rabi Yossi says, anything cooked with spinach is assur, for it imparts flavor.  Rabi Shimon says, (chulin) cabbage from irrigated soil with (truma) cabbage from rain-watered soil is assur, since it absorbs.  Rabi Yehuda says, anything cooked together is allows, except for things with meat.  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri says, live makes assur, but doesn’t become assur, because it exudes but does not absorb.", 
        "An egg cooked with forbidden spices is assur, even its yolk is assur, because it absorbs.  Stewing or pickling water of truma is forbidden to zarim."
