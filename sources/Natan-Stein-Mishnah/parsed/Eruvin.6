        "One who lives with a non-Jew in the (same) courtyard, or with one who doesn’t hold by eruv, this one forbids upon him (to carry into the other part of the courtyard) according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, he will never forbid, until two Jews forbid to each other.", 
        "Raban Gamliel said, there is a story about a Sadducee who lived with us within one mavoy in Yerushalayim, and father said to us, hurry, take all of the vessels out into the mavoy before he carries out and prohibits for you (if he takes out first he may restrict you).  Rabi Yehuda gives a different version (of what could have been said), hurry and fulfill your needs in the mavoy before he carries out and forbids for you.", 
        "People of a courtyard where one of them forgot and didn’t make an eruv, his house is assur from bringing in and out of to him and to them, and theirs are allowed (for bringing in and out ) for him and for them.  If they gave him (the rights to) their domains, it’s mutar for him and assur for them.  If they were two, they prohibit each other, for one can give or take (rights to) a domain, and two can give but not take a domain.", 
        "From when can they give over a domain?  Beit Shamay says, from that day, and Beit Hillel says, (even) from when it darkens.  One who gave over his domain and carried out, whether accidentally or intentionally, he prohibits (to the others, as if withdrawing his transfer of rights) according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, if intentionally he prohibits, but if accidentally, he doesn’t prohibit.", 
        "A homeowner who was a partner with his neighbors (on things in the mavoy), each with wine, they don’t need to make an eruv, if to one with wine and the other with oil, they need to make an eruv.  Rabi Shimon says, in this case or that, they don’t need to make an eruv.", 
        "Five parties which spent Shabbat in one divided hall (each with an entrance to the courtyard), Beit Shamay says, each party makes an eruv, and Beit Hillel says, one eruv (is good) for all of them.  And they (Beit Hillel) admit that when some of them lodge in rooms or different floors, they need to make an eruv for each party.", 
        "Brothers who were partners who ate at their father’s table and slept in their own houses, each one needs an eruv.  Therefore, if one of them forgot and didn’t make an eruv, he renounces his domain.  When?  When they carry their eruv to another place, but if the eruv came to them (was in their father’s house) or there are no other residents in the courtyard, they don’t need an eruv.", 
        "Five courtyards open to each other and a mavoy, if they made an eruv in the courtyards and didn’t participate in the mavoy, they are allowed (to carry) in the courtyards and not in the mavoy, but if they participated in the mavoy, they are allowed in both.  If they made an eruv in the courtyards and participated in the mavoy, and one of the people of the courtyards forgot and didn’t make an eruv, they’re allowed in both, if it was on of the mavoy and didn’t participate, they’re allowed in the courtyards and not the mavoy, for the mavoy to the courtyards is like the courtyard to the house.", 
        "Two courtyards one inside of the other, if he made an eruv for the inner but not the outer, the inner is mutar and the outer is assur.  If (he made an eruv for) the outside but not the inside, they are both assur.  If each one had an eruv for itself (they do not have a common eruv), each is ‘allowed for itself’.  Rabi Akiva prohibits the outer one, for the treading of the foot makes it assur (right of way the inner people have in the outer one), but Chachamim say the treading of the foot does not make assur.", 
        "If one of the outer forgot and didn’t make an eruv, the inner is mutar and the outer is assur.  (One forgot) from the inner and didn’t make an eruv, they are both assur.  They put their eruvin in one place and one forgot and didn’t make an eruv, whether from the inner or outer they are both assur, and if they were of individuals, they don’t need to make an eruv."
