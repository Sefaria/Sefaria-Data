        "The world was created with ten sayings.  What does this come to teach us, couldn’t (Hashem) have created with (only) one saying?  Rather, to punish the wicked, for they are destroying the world created with ten sayings, and to give reward to the righteous, for they uphold the world which was created with ten sayings.", 
        "There are ten generations from Adam to Noach, to show how long-suffering He is, for all the generations constantly angered until He brought upon them the waters of the flood.  There are ten generations from Noach to Avraham, to show how long-suffering He is, for all the generations constantly angered until Avraham came and accepted upon himself the reward for all of them.", 
        "Avraham our father, upon him may there come peace, was tested with ten tests, and he stood through all of them, to show how much was the love of Avraham our father, upon him may there come peace (for Hashem).", 
        "Ten miracles were done to our forefathers in Egypt and ten on the sea.  Hashem brought ten plagues on the Egyptians in Egypt and ten on the sea.  Our forefathers tested Hashem with ten tests in the desert, as it says, “for these tested me ten times and did not listen to my voice.”", 
        "Ten miracles were done for our forefathers in the Beit Hamikdash, that no woman miscarried from the smell of the holy meat, the holy meat never became putrid, a fly was never seen in the slaughterhouse, no happenstance (a nocturnal emission of semen) happened to the kohen gadol on (the night before) Yom Hakippurim, the rains never put out the fire of the woodpile, the wind never won over (moved) the pillar of smoke, a disqualification was never found in the omer, the two breads, or the showbreads (each of which could not have been replaced that day), (when praying) they would stand close together but bow with space, a snake or scorpion never damaged in Yerushalayim, and no man ever said to his fried, there is not enough place for me to sleep over in Yerushalayim.", 
        "Ten (miraculous) things were created one erev Shabbat at twilight (ben hashmashot), and these are they, the mouth of the earth (which swallowed korach), the mouth of the well (which supplied water in the desert), the mouth of (Bilam’s) donkey, the rainbow, the man, the staff (of Moshe), the shamir (a special worm used to cut stones for the mishkan), letters, writing, and the tablets.  And there are those who say, even the harmers (ghosts and demons), the grave of Moshe our Rabbi, and the ram of Avraham our father.  And there are those who say, even tongs made from tongs.", 
        "There are seven things about a boor and seven about a wise person.  A wise person does not speak before one who is greater than wisdom than him, he does not get involved in his friend’s business, he is not hasty to answer, he asks what is relevant and answers base on halacha, he says the first thing first and the last last, and on what he has not heard he says, I haven’t heard and he confesses to the truth, and the opposite for a boor.", 
        "Five types of punishment come to the world for seven bodies of transgression, whine some take ma’asrot and some do not take ma’asrot, famine of (due to) drought comes, some are hungry and some are satiated.  When they decide not to do ma’aser, famine of upheaval and drought comes.  And (they decide) not to take challa, famine of decimation comes.  Plague comes to the world for (as a punishment when people do actions deserving of) deaths said in the torah which were not given into the hand of the court, and for (ignoring the laws of) the fruits of shvi’it.  Sword (war) comes to the world for the delay of justice (ruling improperly) and the perversion of justice, and for those who teach the torah not like (in a different manner than) halacha.", 
        "Evil animals come to the world for idle oaths and for the desecration of (Hashem’s) reputation.  Exile comes to the world for the worshippers of avoda zara, for inappropriate relations, for murder, and for (neglecting) shmitta (release) of the land.  At four periods the plague increases (each of which is after a time money must be given to the poor), the fourth year (of the shmitta cycle), the seventh year (shvi’it), motzei shvi’it, and on motzei chag every year.  The fourth year, because of the ma’aser ani (ma’aser to the poor instead or ma’aser sheni) in the third, in shvi’it because of ma’aser ani in the sixth, an motzei shvi’it because of the produce of shvi’it, and on motzei chag every year, because of robbing of the gifts to the poor (leket, shichicha, and pe’ah).",

        "There are four types who sit before scholars, the sponge, the funnel, the strainer, and the sieve.  Sponge, for he absorbs everything, funnel for he enters from here and lets out with this (hears much but remembers little), the strainer which lest out the wine but retains the dregs (ignores the important points), and the sieve which lets out the flour and keeps the fine flour.", 
        "All love which depends on a thing, if the thing vanishes, the love vanishes.  And that which is not dependant on a thing never vanishes.  Which is a love dependant on a thing?  This is the love of Amnon and Tamar (as we see for Amnon stopped loving her).  Which is a lie that is not dependant on a thing?  This is the love of David and Yonatan (for we learned their souls were tied together).", 
        "Any dispute which is for the sake of heaven, its end will stand (as a productive decision).  And that which is not for the sake of heaven, its end will not stand.  Which is a dispute for the sake of heaven?  This is the dispute of Hillel and Shamay (whose disputes profoundly shaped halacha).  Which is no for the sake of heaven?  This is the dispute of Korach and his assembly (who rebelled against Moshe and Aaron to gain power and glory).", 
        "All who merit for the many (lead the masses to virtue), sin does not come to his hands, as all who causes the masses to sin, there is not enough in his hands to repent.  Moshe merited and merited for the masses, for the merit of the masses was dependant on him, as it says, “the righteousness of Hashem he (Moshe) did and his law was with Yisra’el.”  Yeravam sinned and he caused the masses to sin, the sin of the masses was dependant on him, as it says, “for the sins of Yeravam which he sinned and which ha cases Yisra’el to sin.”", 
        "Whoever has in his hand these three things are from the students of Avraham our forefather, but three other things, they are from the students of Bilam the evil.  (One who has) a good eye (looks at things positively), a low spirit (one who is humble), and a lowly soul (one who avoids focusing on the comforts of this world) is of the students of Avraham our forefather.  (One who has) a bad eye (a negative outlook), a high spirit (pride), and a wide soul (focuses on this world) is of the students of Bilam the evil.  What is (the difference) between the students of Avraham our forefather and the students of Bilam the evil?  The students of Avraham our forefather eat in this world and inheret in the world to come, as it says, “to have those who love me inherit, and I will fill their treasuries.”  But the students of Bilam the wicked inherit hell and descend to the well of destruction, as it says, “and you Hashem will bring them down to the well of destruction, people of blood and deception will not (live) half their days, but I will trust in You.”", 
        "Yehuda ben Teima says, be strong like a tiger, light as an eagle run like a deer, and proud like a lion to do the will of your Father in Heaven.  He would say, strong faced (shameless) are for hell, and those who are of embarrassed faces are for the Garden of Eden (heaven).  May it be the will before You Hashem our God that You shall build Your city quickly, in our days, and give us our portion in your torah.",
