        "A sukka which is taller than twenty amot is pasul, and Rabi Yehuda allows it.  And one which is not taller than ten tfachim, or does not have three walls, or has more sun than shade is pasul.  An old sukka, Beit Shamay invalidate and Beit Hillel holds valid.  What is an old sukka?  All (sukkot) which one made thirty (or more) days before the holiday.  But if he made it for the purpose of the holiday, even from the beginning of the year it is valid.", 
        "One who makes his sukka under a tree, it is as if he made it inside the house.  A sukka on top of a sukka, the top one is valid, and the bottom is invalid.  Rabi Yehuda says, if they don’t live in the upper one, the bottom is valid.", 
        "If he spread a sheet over it (the schach) because of the sun (to block it out) or under it because of leaves dropping (from the schach), or he spread it over the four posts of a bed (he brought into the sukka) it is invalid.  But he may spread it on the crossbar of a bed.", 
        "If he trained over it (the sukka) a (growing) grapevine, gourd, or ivy and he put schach over it, it’s invalid.  And if the schach is more than them, or he cut them, it’s valid.  This is the general rule, anything which can accept tuma and is not grown from the ground one does not make schach with it, and anything which does not accept tuma and is grown from the ground one does make schach with it.", 
        "Bundles of straw, bundles of wood, and bundles of brushwood, one does not use as schach.  And all which he untied are valid.  And they are all valid for the walls.", 
        "One may make schach with wooden planks according to Rabi Yehuda.  And Rabi Meir forbids.  If he put on them a board which is wider than four tfachim, it’s valid, as long as he doesn’t sleep under it.", 
        "A ceiling which has no plaster on it, Rabi Yehuda says, Beit Shamay says, one loosens and removes one from between (every) two (alternating planks), and Beit Hillel says he loosens or takes one from between every two.  Rabi Meir says, he takes one from between every two and he doesn’t loosen.", 
        "One who makes a ceiling for his sukka from spits or long (rods of) beds, it there is space between them like them (their width), it’s valid.  One who burrows in a pile of grain to make a sukka in it, it is not a sukka.", 
        "One who hangs walls from the top down, if it is above the ground by three tfachim, it is invalid.  From the bottom up, if it is above the ground by (up to) ten tfachim, it is valid.  Rabi Yossi says, just as from the bottom up is ten tfachim, so too from the top down is ten tfachim.  If he made the schach more than three tfachim away from the walls, it is invalid.", 
        "A house which was diminished (broke in the middle) and he put schach on it, If from the wall to the schach it is (at least) four amot, it’s invalid.  And so too with a courtyard which is surrounded by a roof structure (which only goes along the sides, next to the houses, but the middle is open).  A large sukka which they encircled with a thing which one may not make schach with, if there are under it (the invalid part) four amot, it is invalid.", 
        "One who makes his sukka like a teepee (a cone) or he leaned it against a wall, Rabi Meir invalidates since it has no roof, and Chachamim allow.  A large mat of reeds, if he made it to lie on, it accepts tuma and one may not make schach with it, (but) if he made it for schach, one may make schach with it and it does not accept tuma.  Rabi Eliezer says, whether small or big, if he made it for lying it accepts tuma and one does not make schach with it, and if (he made it) for schach, one makes schach with it and it does not accept tuma."
