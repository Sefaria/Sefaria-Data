        "Rabi says, what is the straight path that man should choose?  That which is honorable to the doer and brings honor from people.  And be careful in a light mitzvah just as in a grave one, for you don’t know the reward given for a mitzvah.  Consider the loss of doing a mitzvah against its reward, and the benefit from an avera against its loss.  And look at three things and you won’t do any avera, know what is above you, an eye sees and an ear hears, and all of your actions are written in a book.", 
        "Raban Gamliel the son of Rabi Yehuda Hanasi said, nicer is learning torah while doing a worldly job, for working in both causes sin to be forgotten.  And any torah which isn’t with work, in the end it is void and it causes sin.  And all those who work with the public, they should work with them in the name of Hashem, for the merit of their father helps them and their righteousness stands forever.  And you, I raise upon you a great reward, as if you did.", 
        "They were careful with the authorities, for a person doesn’t get close to another except for their own needs.  They seem to be like those who love in the hour or of their benefit, and they don’t stand for that person in the time of his distress.", 
        "He (Raban Gamliel) used to say, do His desire as if it were your desire, such that His desire will be your desire.  Void you desire because of His desire, such that He will void the desire of offers because of your desire.  Hillel says, do not separate from the public, don’t trust yourself (as virtuous) until the day of your death, don’t judge your friend until you are in his situation, don’t say something which may not be heard for in the end it will be heard, and don’t say,  when I become free I’ll study, for you may never become free.", 
        "He (Hillel) would say, a boor cannot fear sin, no ignorant person can be pious, a shy person cannot learn, no impatient person can teach, not everyone who does much business gets intelligent, and in a place where there are no people (to study with), strive t be a person (who one can study with).", 
        "He also saw a skull floating on the surface of the water.  He said to it, since you drowned someone, you were drowned, and in the end because you drowned, others will drown.", 
        "He used to say, the more flesh (fat) the more worms (after death), the more possessions the more worry, the more wives the more sorcery, the more maidservants the more looseness, the more slaves the more theft, the more torah the more life, the more sitting (learning) the more wisdom, the more advice the more understanding, the more charity the more peace.  If he acquired a good name, he acquired for himself.  If he acquired words of torah he acquired the world-to-come.", 
        "Raban Yochanan ben Zakai got (torah) from Hillel and Shamay.  He used to say, if you have learned torah a lot do not claim merit for yourself, because you were created for that.  Raban Yochanan ben Zakai had five students, and these are they, Rabi Eliezer ben Hurkanos, Rabi Yehoshua ben Chanania, Rabi Yossi the kohen, Rabi Shimon ben Netanel, and Rabi Elazar ben Arach.  He would recount their praises, Rabi Eliezer ben Hurkanos is a plastered cistern which doesn’t lose a drop.  Rabi Yehoshua (ben Chanania) fortunate is she who gave birth to him.  Rabi Yossi (the kohen) is pious.  Rabi Shimon ben Netanel fears sin.  And Rabi Elazar ben Arach is an overflowing spring.  He would say, if all the sages of Yisra’el were on one side of a scale and Rabi Eliezer ben Hurkanos was on the other, he would outweigh them all.  Abba Shaul used to say in his name, if all the sages of Yisra’el were on one side and Rabi Eliezer ben Hurkanos was with them, and Rabi Elazar was on the other side, he would outweigh them all.", 
        "He (Rabi Yochanan ben Zakai) said to them, go out and see what is the straight path to which man should stick to.  Rabi Eliezer says, a good eye (liking what one has).  Rabi Yehoshua says, a good friend.  Rabi Yossi says, a good neighbor.  Rabi Shimon says, one who foresees what will be.  Rabi Elazar says, a good heart.  He said to them, I agree with the words of Elazar ben Arach, for included in his words are all of yours.  He said to them, go out and find a bad way which man should distance himself from.  Rabi Eliezer says, a bad eye (liking what one has).  Rabi Yehoshua says, a bad friend.  Rabi Yossi says, a bad neighbor.  Rabi Shimon says, one who borrows and doesn’t pay back, whether he borrows from man or from God, as it says, “you shall lend to a wicked person and he will not pay, and the righteous forgive and pay.”  Rabi Elazar says, a bad heart.  He said to them, I agree with Rabi Eliezer ben Arach, for included in his words are all of yours.", 
        "They said three things.  Rabi Eliezer says, let the honor of your friend be cherished by you like your own, don’t anger easily, and repent one day before your death.  And warm up next to the lamp of Chachamim, , but beware of their burning coals lest they burn you, for their bite is the bite of a fox, their sting is the sting of a scorpion, their hiss is the hiss of a serpent, and all of their words are like coals of fire.", 
        "Yud Rabi Yehoshua says, a bad eye, a bad inclination, and hating the creations remove the man from the land.", 
        "Yud Rabi Yossi says, let the money of your friend be cherished by you as if it were yours, make yourself fit to learn torah, for it is not an inheritance for you, and all of your actions should be in the name of Heaven.", 
        "Yud Rabi Shimon says, be careful when reading shma and shmone esray, and when you pray, don’t make your prayer fixed, rather (make them) mercy and supplication before God, as it says, “for He is gracious and merciful, long suffering, great in kindness, and forgiving of bad (decree).”  And don’t be wicked in front of yourself.", 
        "Yud Rabi Elazar says, be diligent in learning torah, know what to answer an apikores, know before whom you labor, and believe in your employer that he will pay the reward of your work.", 
        "Tet Rabi Tarfon says, the day is short, the work is great, the workers are lazy, the reward is great, and the homeowner is pushing forward (referring to serving God).", 
        "Tet He used to say, the work is not upon you to finish, and you are not a free person to push it off.  If you learned a lot of torah, they give you a lot of reward, and believe your employer that he will pay the reward of your work.  And know, the giving of the reward for the righteous will come in the future."
