        "One who hires a worker to work with olives, if he eats one by one, he’s patur.  If he ate them together, he’s chayav.  If to weed out onions, he said to him, such that I may eat the green,” he may pluck leaf by leaf and eat.  If he eats them together, he’s chayav.", 
        "One found cut dried figs on the road, even a field of cut dried figs, or a fig tree overhanging a path (he found figs beneath it), they’re allowed from a theft perspective, and are patur by ma’asrot, by olives and carobs you’re chayav.  One found a dried fig, and most people have already pressed their fig, it’s chayav, if not, it’s patur.  He found slices of fig cake, it’s chayav, for it’s known that it is from a finished product.  Carobs, until they have been taken up to the rooftop, he may take down for animals and is patur, since he is returning something which was mutar.", 
        "What is a courtyard which makes you have to take ma’asrot?  Rabi Yishma’el says, a courtyard like in Tzur (Tyre), where the goods are guarded.

Rabi Nechemia says, any place where a person is not embarrassed to eat makes it chayav.  Rabi Yossi says, any place where one enters and nobody asks, what do you want here, is patur.  Rabi Yehuda says, two courtyards one inside the other, the inner is chayav and the outer is patur.", 
        "Roofs are patur, even if they are part of a chayav courtyard.  A doorway, patio, or balcony, these are like a courtyard, if they would make chayav, they’re chayav, if they would be patur, they’re patur.", 
        "A cone-shaped hut, a guard shack, and a summer hut are patur.  A hut in Gnisar (where people guarded their plentiful fruit) even though there is a hand-mill and poultry in it (signs of permanence) it’s patur.  A potter’s hut, the inner (a dwelling) is chayav and the outer (a workshop) is patur.  Rabi Yossi says, anything which isn’t lived in summer and winter s patur.  A sukka on Sukkot, Rabi Yehuda says is chayav and Chachamim say is patur.", 
        "A fig tree which is in a courtyard, one may eat one by one and be patur, but if together, he’s chayav.  Rabi Shimon says, he may have one in his right hand, one in his left hand, and one in his mouth.  If he climbed on top of the tree, ha may fill his lap and eat.", 
        "A grape vine which is planted in a courtyard, one may take the whole cluster.  And so too with a pomegranate and watermelon, according to Rabi Tarfon.  Rabi Akiva says, he may pluck from a cluster of grapes, pick seeds from a pomegranate, and cut slices from a watermelon.  Coriander that is sown in a courtyard one may pluck leaf by leaf and eat, but if together, it’s chayav.  Savory, hyssop, and thyme which are in a courtyard, if they are guarded, they are chayav.", 
        "A fig tree that is in a courtyard and overhangs a garden, or is in a garden and overhangs a courtyard, if he eats one by one he’s patur, and if together, he’s chayav.  If it’s in Israel and overhangs outside of Israel, or is outside of Israel and overhangs Israel, it all goes according to the root.  In a house in a walled city (where property doesn’t revert in yovel), it all goes according to the root.  In an ir miklat (defining the city line), it all goes according to the branches.  In Yerushalayim, it all goes according to the branches."
