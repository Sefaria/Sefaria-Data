        "Non-Jews do not have nezirut.  Women and slaves have nezirut.  There is a stringency by women over slaves, for one may force his slave (to violate his nezirut), and he may not force his wife.  There is a stringency by slaves over women, for he may annul the vows of his wife, but he may not annul the vows of his slave.  If he annulled his wife’s, he annulled it forever.  If he annulled his slave’s (not but annulling but by forcing him to break it), and he went free, he completes his nezirut (despite having broken it).  If he passed from before him (the slave ran away), Rabi Meir says, he may not drink (wine, even if his master made him break his vow), and Rabi Yossi says he may drink.", 
        "A nazir who shaved and he became aware that he was tame, if it is a know tuma (one which is clear to people) it blocks (his count, causing him to start his vow again), but if it is a tuma of the depths (an unknown grave was found after he became tame by it) it does not block.  If it is before he shaved, either way it blocks.  How?  He went down to immerse in a cave and (afterwards) found a corpse floating in the cave, (even if we are not sure if he touched it) he’s tame.  If it was found sunken into the floor of the cave and he went down to cool himself, (even though he is not careful while cooling himself, he is tahor.  If he went down (to the cave where a body was found sunken in) to become tahor from tumat met, he’s tame, for one who is assumed tame (stays) tame, and one who is assumed tahor is tahor, and the thing has what to stand on (it has logical basis).", 
        "One who finds a corpse for the first time (reveals a grave) and it is in its usual manner (the way Jews are generally buried) he may take (and place in a cemetery) it and its tvusa (the ground under it which absorbed all of its fluids), and if he found two he may take them and their tvusot.  If he found three (at which point we fear they may be a whole cemetery and not just isolated graves as before), if there is between them (the bodies) from four amot to eight (more shows that they were put near each other by chance and less shows that they were hastily buried together, not a formal graveyard) behold this is a graveyard, and he checks from here (the site of the corpses) and further twenty amot.  If he found one by the end of twenty amot, he checks there and twenty amot further.  And the thing has on what to stand (logical reason), for if he found it originally, he would take it and its tvusa (which we see would have been wrong).", 
        "All doubt by afflictions (tzara’at) is tahor until he is confirmed tame, once he is confirmed tame, his doubt (such as if there is a doubt about whether he has a new instance of tzara’at) is tame.  In seven ways they check a zav (to see if his emission was caused by something external) before he has confirmed ziva, food (certain foods or eating to much), drink, carrying (a heavy load), jumping, illness, sight (if he saw a woman), and thought (about women), once he is confirmed in his ziva they do not check him.  Things beyond his control, his doubt, and his seminal discharge, it has what to stand on (we judge based on precedent).  One who hits his friend and his (friend’s) state neared death, it (his health) became lighter (better) than what it was, and afterward it worsened and he died, he’s chayav (for killing his friend).  Rabi Nechemia says, patur, for it has what to stand on (he was getting better, so we can say it is not the hitting which killed the friend).", 
        "Shmu’el was a nazir, like the words of Rabi Nehoray, as it says, “and a ‘morah’ shall not come upon his head.”  It says by Shimshon, “and a ‘morah’,”  and it says by Shmu’el, “and a ‘morah.”  Just as morah is said by Shimshon, a nazir, so too the word is said by Shmu’el, a nazir.  Rabi Yossi said, and isn’t morah only (fear) of flesh and blood (people)?  Rabi Nehoray said to him, and isn’t it already said, “and Shmu’el said, how can I go, if Shaul hears he will kill me,” for there was already fear of flesh and blood upon him (so the pasuk must refer to a razor)."
