        "A woman, when she is in the house of her husband, and he husband slaughtered for her and he father slaughtered for her, she shall eat from he husband’s.  If she went the first days of Yom Tov to spend in her father’s house, and he father slaughtered for her and her husband slaughtered for her, she eats in whichever place she wants.  An orphan whose guardians slaughtered for him may eat wherever he wants.  A slave belonging to two partners may not eat from either of theirs.  One who is half a slave and half free may not eat from his master’s.", 
        "One who says to his slave, go out and slaughter for me this pesach, if he slaughtered a kid he may eat, if he slaughtered a lamb he may eat, if he slaughtered a kid and a lamb he eats the first one (that was slaughtered).  If he forgets what his master told him, what should he do?  He should slaughter a kid and a lamb and say, if my master said a kid, the kid is his and the lamb is mine, if my master said a lamb, the lamb is his and the kid is mine.  If his master forgot what he said to him, they are both burned and they are exempt from doing Pesach Sheni.", 
        "One who says to his sons, I am slaughtering the pesach for whichever of you get to Yerushalayim first (and the others will get through him), since (the time when) the first entered his head and most of his body, he merited for himself and all of his brothers merit through him.  People can group up forever (in any number) as long as there is a kzayit for each.  They may group up or withdraw (from a group) until it is slaughtered.  Shimon says, until they sprinkle the blood for it.", 
        "One who includes other people with him in his portion, the people of the group have a right to give him is part, and he eats with his (people and portion) and they eat with them.", 
        "A zav who saw two sightings (of seminal flux), they may slaughter for him on the seventh (on the night of which he can become clean).  If he saw three, they slaughter for him on the eighth of his (days of purity, at the night of which he may become fully clean).  A woman keeps a day against a day (of seeing blood) and they slaughter for her on the second.  If she saw two days, they slaughter for her on the third.  A zava, they slaughter for her on the eighth (when she becomes fully clean).", 
        "An onen (a person who has a relative who died that day, and is assur from eating sacrifices), one who removes a pile (of stones which fell on a person, and we do not know if the person is dead or alive), and so too one who was promised to be released from prison, and a sick person and an old person who can eat a kzayit one may slaughter for them.  On all of them one may not slaughter for them on only their behalf, for perhaps they will make the pesach tame.  Therefore, if they happen to be pasul, they are patur from Pesach Sheni except for one who removes a pile, for he is tame at the outset.", 
        "On may not slaughter the pesach for an individual according to Rabi Meir, and Rabi Yossi allows it.  Even a group of one hundred who cannot eat a kzayit, they do not slaughter for them.  And one may not make a group of women, slaves, and minors.", 
        "An onen immerses and eats his pesach at night, but not any other offerings (the pesach is a mitzvat ase and a lo ta’ase).  One who hears he has a dead (relative) and one who gathers bones for himself (to rebury in a permanent grave) immerses and may eat other sacrifices.  A convert who converted erev Pesach, Beit Shamay says, he immerses and eats his pesach at night, and Beit Hillel says, one who separates from a foreskin is (like) one who separates from a grave (he may not eat)."
