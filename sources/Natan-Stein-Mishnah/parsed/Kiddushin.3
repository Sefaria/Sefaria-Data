        "One who says to his friend, go and betroth me such-and-such a woman, and he went and betrothed her for himself, she is betrothed.  And so too one who says to a woman, behold you are betrothed to me after thirty days, and another one came and betrothed her within thirty days, she is betrothed to the second.  A bat yisra’el to a kohen (if he was the second), she may eat truma.  (If one betroths) from now until thirty days, and another came and betrothed her within thirty days, she is betrothed and not betrothed (it is a doubt).  A bat yisra’el to a kohen or a bat kohen to a yisra’el, she may not eat truma.", 
        "One who says to a woman, behold you are betrothed to me on condition that I give you two hundred zuz, she is engaged and he will give.  On condition that I will give you (two hundred zuz) from here until thirty days, if he gave her within thirty days, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  On condition that I have two hundred zuz, behold she is betrothed and he has.  On condition that that I will show you two hundred zuz, behold this on is engaged and he will show her.  And if he showed her on the table (if he is a moneychanger, it is the money of others), she is not betrothed.", 
        "(If one engages a woman) on condition that I have a bet kor (enough land to sow a kor, 30 se’ah, of seeds), behold this one is betrothed if this one has.  On condition that I have in such-and-such a place, if he has in that place, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  On condition that I will show you a beit kor of earth, behold she is betrothed if he shows.  And if he showed her in a valley (which is not his), she is not betrothed.", 
        "Rabi Meir says, all conditions which aren’t like the conditions of bnei gad and bnei reuven (when they wanted to settle across the Jordan), are not conditions, as it says, “and Moshe said to them, if bnei gad and bnei reuven cross (to help conquer Israel they will get the land they want),” and it is written, “and if they do not cross armed,” (showing that a condition needs to be made with both the positive and negative actions explained)  Rabi  Chanania ben Gamliel says, he had to say this (the second condition) for without this, there was reason (to believe that the consequence for not crossing would be losing all rights to land (whereas Moshe says they get land in Israel).", 
        "One who betrothed a woman and said, I thought she was a kohenet, and behold she is a levi’a, a levi’a and behold she is a kohenet, poor and behold she is rich, or rich and behold she is poor, behold she is betrothed because she did not deceive him.  One who says to a woman, behold you are betrothed to me after I convert, after you convert, after I am freed (from slavery), after you are freed, after your husband dies, after your sister dies (he was married to her sister and therefore forbidden to marry the woman), or after your yavam does chalitza for you, she is not betrothed.  And so too one who says to his friend, if your wife gives birth to a girl, behold she is betrothed to me, she is not betrothed.  If the wife of his friend was pregnant and the pregnancy was known, his words stand, and if she gives birth to a girl, she is betrothed.", 
        "One who says to a woman, behold you are betrothed to me on condition that I speak on your behalf to the governor, or I do for you like a laborer (work for you).  If he spoke about her to the governor or did for her like a laborer, she is betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  On condition that (my) father wants (us to be engaged), if the father wants, she’s betrothed, and if not, she is not betrothed.  If the father died, behold she is betrothed.  If the son died, they instruct the father to say that he doesn’t want.", 
        "(If a man says,) I betrothed my daughter but I don’t know who I betrothed her to, and one comes and says, I betrothed her, he is believed.  If one said, I betrothed her, and one said, I betrothed her, they both give a get, but if they want, one gives a get and one marries (her).", 
        "(If a man says,) I betrothed my daughter I betrothed her and divorced her while she was a minor, and behold she is a minor, he is believed.  I betrothed her and divorced her while she is a minor, and behold she is an adult, he is not believed.  She was taken captive (making her assur to a kohen) and I redeemed her, whether she was a minor or an adult, he is not believed.  One who said at the time of his death, I have sons (meaning his wife does not need yibum), he is believed.  (If a dying person said,) I have brothers (and it is clear that he had no sons, and therefore his wife needs yibum), he is not believed.  One who betroths his daughter without specifying (which daughter), the bogrot (adults) aren’t included (in the possible spouses).", 
        "One who has two sets of daughters from two wives and said, I betrothed my older daughter, and I do not know if it was the older of the older (daughters, the first born), the older of the younger (third born), or the younger of the older (second), for she is older than the older of younger (third), all of them are assur (to marry unless they get a get), except for the younger of the younger (fourth), according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, all of them are allowed, except for the older of the older (first).  (If the man says,) I betrothed my younger daughter, and I do not know if is the younger of the younger (fourth), the younger of the older (second), or the older of the younger (third), for she is younger than the younger of the older (second), all of them are assur except the older of the older (first), according to Rabi Meir.

        "One who says to a woman, I betrothed you, and she says, you didn’t betroth me, he is assur to her relatives and she is mutar to his relatives.  If she says, you betrothed me, and he says, I didn’t betroth you, he is mutar to her relatives, but she is assur to his relatives.  (If a man says,) I betrothed you, and she says, you didn’t betroth other than my daughter, he is assur to the relatives of the older (mother) and the older is mutar to his relatives, he is mutar to the relatives of the younger (the daughter) and the younger is mutar to his relatives.", 
        "(If a man says,) I betrothed your daughter, and she says, you didn’t betroth other than me, he is assur to the relatives of the younger and the younger is mutar to his relatives, he is mutar to the relatives of the older, and the older is assur to his relatives.  ", 
        "Any place there is kiddushin (betrothal) and no transgression (in the marriage), the children go after the male (the father’s lineage).  And which is it?  This is a kohenet, a levi’a, and a yisra’elit who married a kohen, to a levi, and to a yisra’el.  And every place where there is kiddushin and there is transgression (the marriage is invalid), the offspring go after the blemished (who makes the marriage invalid).  And which is it?  A widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee or a chalutza to a lay kohen, a mamzer or netina to a yisra’el, or the bat of a yisra’el to a mamzer or natin.  And all who do not have kiddushin for him (it is invalid), but she has kiddushin for others (she could get kiddushin, but there is something wrong with it being with this man), this is a mamzer.  And which is it?  This is one who has relations with any of the inappropriate relations which is in the torah.  And all who do not have kiddushin for him and does not have kiddushin for others (meaning they are forbidden to everyone), the offspring is like her.  And which is it?  This is the offspring of a maidservant and a non-Jew.", 
        "Rabi Tarfon says, mamzerim can become pure.  How?  A mamzer who married a maidservant, the offspring is a slave.  If he was freed, the son is found to be a freedman (and passes on pure lineage).  Rabi Eliezer says, behold, this is a mamzer slave."
