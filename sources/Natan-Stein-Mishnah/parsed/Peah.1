        "These things have no maximum limit – pe’ah, bikurim, the korban for a regel, acts of kindness, and learning torah.  These things a man gets benefit in this world, and the principal lasts until the next world – honoring one’s parents, chessed, making peace between people, and torah learning is matched to all of them.", 
        "Pe’ah is no lest than a sixtieth, even though it has no shiur.  It’s all based on the size of the field, the number of poor, and on humbleness.", 
        "You can leave pe’ah at the beginning of the field or in the middle.  Rabbi Shimon says give from wherever, as long as you give the proper amount.  Rabi Yehuda says, if you leave even one stalk, you’re yotze.  And if not, he only gives by making some of his produce hefker.", 
        "There’s a general rule about pe’ah – all food, that isn’t made hefker, is grown from the ground, is harvested at once, and can be stored is chayav on pe’ah.  And grains and legumes are included in this.", 
        "Lists several species of trees that are chayav in pe’ah.", 
        "One is always chayav in pe’ah and patur from ma’asrot until you neaten the pile.  And you can make it hefker and are patur from ma’asrot until you neaten the pile.  Animal feed is patur from ma’asrot until you neaten the pile.  Reusing seeds are patur from ma’asrot until you neaten the pile according to Rabi Akiva.  A kohen or levi who buy grain can keep the truma and ma’aser unless it was evened.  Something you make hekdesh and then redeem is chayav truma and ma’aser if the treasurer neatened it."
