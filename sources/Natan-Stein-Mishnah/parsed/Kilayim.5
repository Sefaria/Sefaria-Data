        "A destroyed vineyard, if ten vines can still be harvested in any bet se’ah, and they are planted properly, this is a reduced vineyard.  An irregularly planted vineyard, if there is any place where the regular patter is found, it is a vineyard, and if no, it’s not.  Rabi Meir says, since it has an appearance that is the form of a vineyard, it is a vineyard.", 
        "A vineyard that is less than four amot between rows, Rabi Shimon says it’s not a vineyard (they are too close for proper development),  Chachamim say it is, and we see the intervening rows as non-existent.", 
        "A ditch that passes through a vineyard that is deeper than ten tfachim and wider than four, Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, if it travels the length of the vineyard, it is like lying between two vineyards and can be planted in.  If not, it is seen as a winepress.  A winepress of that size in a vineyard, Rabi Eliezer says you can sow in it, but the Chachamim prohibit it.  A lookout mound in a vineyard taller than ten tfachim and wider than four can be sown in, but if branches intertwine above it, it’s assur.", 
        "A vine planted in a winepress or cleft in the field, you leave room to till it and you may plant.  Rabi Yossi says, if there aren’t four amot in the winepress or cleft, you may not plant in it.  One may sow in a (roofed) house in the middle of a vineyard.", 
        "If one plants vegetables or leaves planted vegetables in a vineyard, this makes forty-five vines (those within sixteen amot) forbidden.  When is this? When they are planted four or five amot apart.  If they are planted six or seven amot apart, it prohibits sixteen amot in each direction, in a circle (radius), not a square (half a side).", 
        "If one sees a (wild) vegetable in a vineyard and says, I will remove it when I get there, it is permitted.  If he reached it and said, I will remove it when I come back, if it has grown by one two-hundredth, it is kilayim.", 
        "One was passing through a vineyard and some seeds fell from him, or seeds were in manure or water he was using on the vineyard, or the wind blew them to an unacceptable place behind him without his knowledge, it’s mutar.  If the wind blew it in front of him, Rabi Akiva says if he sees blades growing, he must plow it, if it’s an underdeveloped stalk, he must beat it, and if it has produced grain, it must be burnt.", 
        "One who lets thorns stay in his vineyard, Rabi Eliezer says, it is forbidden.  Chachamim say it’s not unless that type of thorn is normally allowed to stay in that area (and is valued).  Iris, ivy, king’s-lily, and all seeds (except grains and vegetables) aren’t kilayim in a vineyard.  Hemp, Rabi Tarfon says isn’t kilayim, but Chachamim say it is.  And artichoke is kilayim."
