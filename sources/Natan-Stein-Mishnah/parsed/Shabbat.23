        "One may borrow from his friend jugs of wine and oil, as long as he doesn’t say, loan me, and so too with a woman (borrowing) from her friends loaves.  And if he doesn’t believe him, he leaves his cloak with him and they settle accounts after Shabbat.  And so too with Pesach which falls on erev Shabbat, he leaves his cloak by him and takes his pesach, and settles the accounts after Yom Tov.", 
        "A person may count his guests and his courses orally, but not from a written list.  One may have a lottery (to determine who gets which portion and the like) with his sons and the people of his household, as long as he doesn’t intend to have one large portion against a small one because of dice (which would make it like an exchange, assur on Shabbat).  And one may cast lots for sacrifices on Yom Tov, but not on portions.", 
        "One may not hire workers on Shabbat, and he may not tell his friend to rent workers for him.  One may not go to the limit (2,000 amot that one may walk outside a city) near nightfall (before motzei Shabbat) in order to hire workers or get produce (from a field).  But, he may (go out) by nightfall in order to guard (his field, for it would be allowed on Shabbat if within the walking limit, unlike the previous cases) and may bring produce with him.  Abba Shmu’el said a general rule, anything in which I am innocent for speaking about, I may wait at nightfall for it.", 
        "One may wait at nightfall at the limit to care for the matters of a bride and for the matters of the dead, to bring for him a coffin and shrouds.  A non-Jew who brought flutes on Shabbat, a Jew may not eulogize with them, unless they come from a nearby place.  If they made for him a coffin and dug for him a grave, a Jew may be buried in it, and if it was for a (made) Jew, one may never be buried there.", 
        "One may do all the needs of a dead person, one may anoint and wash him, as long as they do not move his limb (it is muktza).  One may take a pillow from beneath him and put him on the sand so that he will last.  One may tie the cheek (which naturally falls open), not so that it will close, but rather that it should no increase (in size).  So too a beam which broke, one may support it with a bench or bedposts, not that it will be raised up, just so that it will not increase.  One may not close the eyes of a corpse on Shabbat and not on a weekday with (near) the departure of the soul, and if he closes near the departure of the soul, behold he is killing (he may bring death faster)."
