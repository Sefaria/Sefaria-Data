        "One who was tame or far away and didn’t do the first (Pesach) shall do the second.  If he made a mistake or was forced and didn’t do the first, he does the second.  If so, why does it say one who was tame or far away?  For they are exempt from karet (if they don’t keep Pesach Sheni) and those are chayav karet.", 
        "What is far away?  From Modi’im and outward, and its measurement in every direction according to Rabi Akiva.  Rabi Eliezer says, from the threshold of the courtyard and outward (if he only made it there before chag).  Rabi Yossi says, therefore there is a dot on the hay to say (on the word ‘rechoka’ in the torah, making it farther than it), not because it is surely far, but rather because it’s the threshold of the courtyard and outward.", 
        "What is the difference between Pesach Rishon and Pesach Sheni?  The first is assur by, “it shall not be seen,” and, “it shall not be found.”  On the second, he can have matza and chametz in his house.  The first requires hallel while eating, and the second doesn’t need hallel while eating.  Both need hallel when they are done, and may be eaten roasted with matza and maror, and it pushed off Shabbat.", 
        "A pesach which was offered while tame, a zav, zava, nidda, and woman who just gave birth may not eat from it, and if they did, they are patur from karet.  Rabi Eliezer exempts even for one who enters the Beit Hamikdash (accidentally when in one of these states).", 
        "What is the difference between the pesach which was done in Egypt and the one for all other generations?  The pesach of Egypt they took on the tenth, it required sprinkling with a hyssop branch on the lintel and the two doorposts, it was eaten hastily, and in one night, and the Pesach of all other generations (the prohibition against chametz) is observed all seven (days).", 
        "Rabi Yehoshua said, I heard that a substitute for a pesach (if one designates an animal for the pesach but then switches, the original animal still retains some obligation and should be brought as a shlamim) is offered, and a substitute for a pesach isn’t offered, and I can’t explain it.  Rabi Akiva said, I’ll explain it.  The pesach (which got lost) was found before the slaughtering of the (second) pesach should be put out to pasture until it becomes blemished and then sold, and with that money the owner will buy a shlamim, and so too for its substitute.  After the slaughtering of the pesach the shlamim is brought, and so too with a substitute.", 
        "One who separates a ewe for his pesach, or a two-year-old mountain goat he puts it out to pasture until it becomes blemished and sells it, and the owner uses the money as a nedava (donation offering).  One who separates a pesach and dies, his son may not bring it as a pesach, but rather as a shlamim.", 
        "A pesach which got mixed up with other zvachim, they all go to pasture until they become blemished, and the owner sells them and buys animals (equal in number to the first) based on the best of this species (each animal for the highest price he received for one of that species) and he will lose the extra (of what he’s spending over what he got).  If it got mixed in with bechorot (firstborn animals), Rabi Shimon says, if there is a group of kohanim, they eat it.", 
        "A group which lost its pesach, and they said to one, go out, fins, and slaughter for us, and he went out, found, and slaughtered, and they bought and slaughtered, if his (the individual) was slaughtered first, he eats of his and they eat with him of his, and if theirs was slaughtered first, they eat their own and he eats his own.  And if it’s not known which one was slaughtered first, or if they were slaughtered together, he eats of his and they do not eat of his, and theirs goes out to be burnt, and they are patur from Pesach Sheni.  If he said to them, if I take too long, go and slaughter for me, and he went, found, and slaughtered and they bought and slaughtered.  If theirs was slaughtered first, they eat of theirs and he eats with them, if his was slaughtered first, he eats of his and they eat of theirs.  If it’s not known whose was slaughtered first or they were slaughtered together, they eat of theirs and he does not eat with them, and his goes to be burnt and he is patur from doing Pesach Sheni.  If he said to them, and they said to him, everyone eats of the first and if it’s not known which of them is first, they both go to be burnt.  If he didn’t say to them and they didn’t say to him, they are not responsible for each other.", 
        "Two groups whose pesachs became mixed up, each takes one, one from each group goes to the other, and they all say, if this is our pesach, you withdrew from yours and you subscribed to ours, and if this is yours, we have withdrawn from ours and subscribed to yours.  And so too five groups of five each or ten each, they take on from each of the groups and say like this.", 
        "Two whose pesachs got mixed up, each takes one, each subscribes to his one (person) from the shuk, they come to each other (the person who just joined the other group) and say, if this pesach is mine, you leave your group and come to mine, if this is the is yours, I leave mine and come to yours."
