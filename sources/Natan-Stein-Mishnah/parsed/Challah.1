        "Five things are chayav in challa, wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye.  These are liable for challa and combine (if kneaded together they combine towards the minimum measurement).  They are assur because of ‘chadash’ a month before Pesach, or if harvested before the omer.  If they took root before omer, the omer allows them, but if not, they are assur until the next omer.", 
        "One who eats a kzayit of matza made of them on Pesach he fulfilled his obligation.  A kzayit of chametz (leavened bread), he is chayav caret.  If (chametz of) one of these mixed up with something else, this is transgressing on Pesach.  One who makes a vow against bread and cereal grains (tvu’a) is prohibited from having them, according to Rabi Meir. Chachamim say, one who takes a vow against things stacked like grains (dagan) is only prohibited from having them.  And they (the grains) are chayav in challa and ma’asrot.", 
        "These are chayav in challa but patur from ma’aser.  Leket, shichicha, pe’ah, hefker, ma’aser rishon from which truma has been taken, redeemed ma’aser sheni and hekdesh, leftover from omer, and produce which hasn’t reached a third of its final growth.  Rabi Eliezer says, produce which hasn’t reached a third of its size is chayav by challa.", 
        "These are chayav in ma’aser but patur in challa.  Rice, millet, poppy seed, sesame, legumes, anything less than five rova of produce, doughnuts, cakes fried in honey, griddle cakes, pancakes and meduma cakes, these are patur from challa.", 
        "Dough that started as for doughnuts, and ends as doughnuts is patur from challa.  If it starts as dough and winds up doughnuts or the reverse, it is chayav by challa.  Kenuvka cakes (small cakes mad of bread crumbs) are also chayav.", 
        "Me’isa (flour mixed into boiling water), Beit Shamay says it’s patur and Beit Hillel says it’s chayav.  Chalita (boiling water poured over flour), Beit Shamay says it’s chayav and Beit Hillel say it’s patur.  Loaves for a (korban) toda and wafers of a (korban) nazir, if he made it for himself (for his korban) it’s patur, but if he made to sell in the shuk, he’s chayav.", 
        "A baker who made a leavened (dough) in order to divide it up (into loaves too small to need challa) he’s chayav in challa.  If women give a baker dough to make into leaven, if none of them is enough (to require challa) it’s patur from challa.", 
        "Dough for dogs (which contains bran), if shepherds (would) eat from it it’s chayav challa, and it may be used as part of an eruv (to allow carrying on Shabbat), for shituf (allowing carrying between courtyards), one makes a bracha on it, one makes a zimun on it, it may be made on Yom Tov, and one can fulfill his obligation on Pesach.  If shepherds don’t eat from it, it’s not chayav challa, and one doesn’t make an eruv on it, do shituf with it, make a bracha on it, make a zimun on it, make it on Yom Tov, or fulfill his obligation on Pesach.  Either way, it becomes tame with the tuma of food.", 
        "Challa and truma incur death penalties and require chomesh, are assur to zarim, are the property of a kohen, are nullified by one in a hundred, require washing of hands (before touching) and sunset (for a kohen who immersed that day), and may not be separated from the tahor on the tame, and only from nearby and finished products.  One who says, my entire threshing floor is truma, or, the whole dough is challa, didn’t say anything until he sets aside part."
