        "All holy writings one may save from a fire, whether or not they are read from.  And even if they are written in any language (other than Hebrew, and are burned) they must be buried.  And why don’t we read in them (ktuvim, referred to in the first line)?  Because of the neglect of the beit midrash (house of study, where sermons were given on Shabbat, but people might skip and read the ktuvim).  One may save the case of a book with a book and the bag of tfillin with the tfillin, even if they have money in them.  And to where does one save them?  Into an alley which isn’t open (a dead end alley which can easily be closed off).  Ben Bteira says, even if it’s open.", 
        "One may save food (from a fire) for the three meals, that which is fit for a person, (is saved) for a person, and that which is fit for an animal, (is saved) for an animal.  If a fire broke out on Shabbat evening, one saves food for three meals, if at shacharit (in the morning) one saves food for two, if at mincha time (the afternoon) one saves for one.  Rabi Yossi says, a person always saves for three meals.", 
        "One may save a basket full of loaves, and even though it has in it a hundred meals, a cake of pressed figs, or a barrel of wine.  And he says to others, come and save for yourselves.  And if they were prudent, they would settle accounts with him after Shabbat.  To where do they save them?  To a courtyard with an eruv.  Ben Bteira says, even if it doesn’t have an eruv.", 
        "And one may take all of his utensils out to there, and he may wear everything he can wear (fit on at once), and wraps in everything ha can wrap in.  Rabi Yossi says, eighteen garments and he returns and put on and takes out (more clothing, but only eighteen at a time) and he may tell others, come and save with me.", 
        "Rabi Shimon ben Nanas says, one may spread the hide of a kid on a dresser, a chest, and a cupboard (all wooden) in which the fire has caught, because it (the hide, only) is singed.  And they may make a divider with any vessel, whether they are filled or empty so that the fire doesn’t pass.  Rabi Yossi forbids with a new, earthenware vessel filled with water, for they cannot accept the fire, and will burst and put out the fire.", 
        "A non-Jew who comes to put it out, one does not say to him, put it out or, don’t put it out, for his resting of Shabbat is not on them (they aren’t accountable for him), but a minor who came to put out, they do not listen to him, for his resting on Shabbat is on them.", 
        "One may put a dish on top of a candle so it doesn’t catch on the (ceiling) beam, on the excrement of a minor, and on a scorpion so it won’t sting.  Rabi Yehuda said, a case (of a scorpion) came before Raban Yochanan ben Zakai in Arav, and he said, I fear (that he is chayav for) a chatat (for trapping).", 
        "A non-Jew who lit a candle, a Jew may use the light, but if he lit it for the Jew, it’s assur.  If he filled (a trough with) water to water his flock, a Jew may water after him, but if he filled it for the Jew, it’s assur.  If a non-Jew made a ramp to go down on, a Jew may go down on it, but if he made it for the Jew, it’s assur.  Once Raban Gamliel and the Zekenim were coming on a boat, and a non-Jew made a ramp on which to go down, and they went down on it."
