        "When it is still light on the fourteenth (nightfall) we check for chametz (leavened baked goods) by the light of a candle.  Anywhere one does not bring chametz one does not need to check.  Why did they say (one has to check) two rows (of barrels) in a cellar?  It’s a place one may go into with chametz.  Beit Shamay says, two rows over the whole cellar and Beit Hillel says, the two outer rows which are the uppermost (both of these statements are difficult and debated in the gemara).", 
        "One does not suspect that perhaps a rat dragged from house to house or place to place, for if so it (can be) from courtyard to courtyard and city to city, the thing has no end.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda says, one checks the evening of the fourteenth, and in the morning of the fourteenth and the time of burning, and the Chachamim say, if he didn’t check the evening of the fourteenth, he checks during the holiday.  If he didn’t check during the holiday, he checks after the holiday.  And whatever he leaves, he puts in a hidden place so that it doesn’t need another checking.", 
        "Rabi Meir says, one may eat all five (of the first hours of the day) and burns at the beginning of the sixth, and Rabi Yehuda says, one eats all four, suspends the fifth, and burns at the beginning of the sixth.", 
        "And furthermore said Rabi Yehuda, two loaves of a toda (offering) which are pasul are laid on the roof of the itzteva (a place in the Beit Hamikdash, as a signal).  Whenever they are placed there, the whole nation would eat.  If one is taken, they suspend, they don’t eat and don’t burn.  If they are both taken, the whole nation would start to burn.  Raban Gamliel says, chulin may be eaten the whole fourth, truma the whole fifth, and they burn at the beginning of the sixth.", 
        "Rabi Chanina a sgan (vice) of the kohanim says, from the days of the kohanim, they didn’t refrain from burning meat that became contaminated with an offshoot of the tuma with meat which became contaminated from the source of tuma, even though they are adding tuma on tuma.  Rabi Akiva added and said, from the days of the kohanim they didn’t refrain from lighting oil which became invalid from one who had immersed that day with a candle which became contaminated from a dead body, even though they are adding tuma to tuma.", 
        "Rabi Meir said, we learn from their words (in the previous mishna) that one may burn tahor truma with tame truma on Pesach.  Rabi Yossi said to him, that is not the right argument.  And Rabi Eliezer and Rabi Yehoshua admit that you burn this by itself and this by itself.  One what did they disagree?  On the suspended and the tame, for Rabi Eliezer says, let this be burnt by itself and this burnt by itself, and Rabi Yehoshua says, they are both like one."
