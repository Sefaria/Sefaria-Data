        "One who hires (a Jewish) worker to work with him on libation wine (for avoda zara), his wage is assur.  If he hired him to do some other work, even if he said to him, transfer for me this barrel of libation wine from place to place, his wage is mutar.  One who rents a donkey to bring libation wine on it, its rent is assur.  If he rented it to sit on it, even if the non-Jew rested his bottle (of wine) on it, its rent is mutar.", 
        "Libation wine which fell on grapes, he may wash them and they are mutar, but if they were split they are assur.  If it fell on figs or on dates, if there is enough to impart flavor, it is assur.  There was a case with Baytos ben Zonin who brought dried figs in a boat, a barrel of libation wine broke and fell on them, he asked the Chachamim and they allowed them.  This is the general rule, all which he benefits by it imparting flavor is assur, and anything which he does not benefit from it imparting flavor is mutar, for example vinegar which fell on barley.", 
        "A non-Jew who was moving barrels of wine from place to place with a Jew, if he was with a presumption of one who was supervised (so it is known that he will not try to touch the wine) it is mutar.  If he (the supervising Jew) informed him that he was leaving, (it is assur if he leaves) long enough to open (a barrel), seal, and wipe (away any trace of wine).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, long enough for him to open, stop up, and for it to dry.", 
        "One who leaves his wine in a wagon or ship (in the care of a non-Jew) and goes on a short cut, enters a region, and bathes, it (the wine) is mutar (for the non-Jew does not know how long he will be and will be afraid to touch the wine.  If he informed him that he was leaving, long enough for him to open, close, and wipe off.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, enough for him to open, stop up, and for it to dry.  One who leaves a non-Jew in a store (that sells wine), even if he (the owner merely) enters and exits, it is mutar.  If he informed him that he was leaving, long enough for him to open, close, and wipe off.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, enough for him to open, stop up, and for it to dry.", 
        "If he (a Jew) was eating with him (a non-Jew) on a table, and he (the Jew) put a bottle (of wine) on the table and a bottle on the serving stand, and left it and exited, what is on the table is assur (for the non-Jew would not fear to touch something on the table), but what is on the serving stand is mutar.  But if he (the Jew) said to him, pour and drink, even what is on the serving stand is assur.  Open barrels (left with a non-Jew in the house) are assur.  Closed ones, (are assur if left) long enough to open, stop up, and for them to dry off.", 
        "A troop of non-Jews (who came to search houses for provision they can take) which came into a town during peacetime, open barrels (in a house were they are) are assur, and closed ones are mutar.  In wartime, these and those (both) are mutar, for there is not time for libations.", 
        "Jewish artisans to whom a non-Jew sent a barrel of wine as his fee, they may say to him, give me its money (the worth), but if it is from the time it entered their possession, it is assur (because then it is his and he may not benefit from it).  One who sells his wine to a non-Jew, if he set (the price) for him before he measured (and the non-Jew touched it) his money is mutar, but if he measured and then set for hi, his money is assur.  If he took a funnel and measured into the bottle of the non-Jew (which had some win left in it), and then measured into the bottle of a Jew, fire there is on it (the funnel) the residue of wine, it is assur.  One who pours from vessel to vessel, that which is poured from is mutar (even if it is pouring into assur) and that which is poured into is assur.", 
        "Libation is assur and forbids by any amount at all.  Wine (which is assur mixed) with wine, or water (which was used for avoda zara) with water, (is assur) in any amount.  Wine with water or water with wine, with enough (assur) to impart flavor.  This is the general rule, a type in its type, with some (it becomes any assur from any at all) but with what is not its type, enough to impart flavor.", 
        "These are assur and forbid (other things) with any amount at all, libation wine, avoda zara, skins (leather) of the heart (for avoda zara they would take out the heart from the animal while killing it), a stoned ox, egla arufa (when the sages kill a calf in repentance for an unknown corpse found), the birds (brought as a korban by) a metzora, the hair of a nazir, the redeemed donkey (the firstborn which is redeemed with a sheep), meat and milk, the sent goat (on Yom Hakippurim sent into the wilderness), and chulin (non-holy meat) which was slaughtered in the courtyard (of the Beit Hamikdash), behold there are assur and forbid with any amount at all.", 
        "Libation wine which fell into a pit (of wine), it is all assur from benefit.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, he may sell it all to a non-Jew except (minus) the worth of the libation wine in it.", 
        "A stone winepress (or the barrel) which a non-Jew tarred, he may wipe it (wash it) and it is tahor (valid for use).  One (a barrel) of wood (which a non-Jew tarred), Rabi says, he may wipe it.  Chachamim say, he peels off the tar.  And one of earthenware, even if he peels off the tar, behold it is assur.", 
        "One who buys a vessel of use (for cooking) from a non-Jew, one which its way is to be immersed (used with cold liquids), he immerses, to be boiled (used with hot liquids), he boils.  To make white hot in fire (cook on), he makes white hot with fide.  A skewer and a grill, he must make white hot with fire, a knife, he sharpens and it is tahor."
