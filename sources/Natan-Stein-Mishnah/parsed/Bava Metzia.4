        "Gold (coinage) acquires silver (coinage, meaning trading gold for silver automatically acquires the silver), but silver does not acquire gold (an act of acquisition must be made on gold which is traded for with silver).  Copper acquires silver, but silver does not acquire copper.  Worse money (which is not as easily useable, such as gold or copper) acquire better money (silver, which is usable everywhere) but better money does not acquire worse money (since the worse money is seen as a commodity, and giving a commodity acquires by obligating the other party to pay for it, but the better money is seen as a purchase, which is not binding).  An unminted coin acquires a coin, but a coin does not acquire an unminted coin.  Objects acquire a coin, but a coin does not acquire objects.  This is the general rule, all objects acquire each other (bartering is acquisition, but selling is not).", 
        "How (can we say that objects acquire but money does not)?  If he (a person) took from him (a vendor) produce, but didn’t give him money, he cannot return it (for his taking was an act of acquisition).  If he gave him money but didn’t take produce from him, he can return it.  But they said, He who punished the generation of the flood and the generation of the separation (Tower of Babel) we will punish those who do not stand on their word (return things they have given money for).  Rabi Shimon says, whoever has the money in his hand, he has the upper hand (if money has been given only the vendor can cancel the deal).", 
        "Ona’ah (cheating) is four silver (ma’ah) out of the twenty-four (ma’ah which are) in a sela, one sixth of the purchase.  Until when is he allowed to return (if he feels he was cheated)?  Until he can show to a merchant or relative (so he can see if he was cheated, but after that it is unreasonably long).  Rabi Tarfon instructed in Lod, ona’ah is eight silver (ma’ah) to a sela, a third of the purchase, and the inhabitants of Lod were happy (for they were experts at trading and would now be able to make more money).  He said to them, the whole day one is allowed to return.  They said to him, let Rabi Tarfon leave us in our place, and they went back to the words of the Chachamim.", 
        "Whether the buyer or the seller, they have (a right to return) ona’ah.  Just as ona’ah is for a layperson, so too it is for a merchant.  Rabi Yehuda says, there is no ona’ah for a merchant (he may not claim he was cheated, for he is an expert).  The one who was taken from (cheated), he has the upper hand.  If he wants he can say, give me the money, or, give me what you cheated me.", 
        "Hoe much may a sela be missing (in value due to wear) and it will not have ona’ah.  Rabi Meir says, four issar, an issar per dinar (a sela if four dinar).  Rabi Yehuda says, for pundyon (two issar), a pundyon per dinar.  Rabi Shimon says, eight pundyon, two pundyon per dinar.", 
        "Until when is he allowed to return?  In cities, until (he has enough time to) show to a moneychanger, and in villages, until the (upcoming) erev Shabbat.  If he (the one who gave the sela) recognizes it, even after twelve months he gets it (back) from him, and he (the one taking back) has nothing on him (is owed nothing) except resentment.  And he can give it for ma’aser sheni and not worry (about punishment) for there is only on him that he is a bad person.", 
        "Ona’ah is four silver (for every sela), claiming is two silver (this is the minimum considered denying a claim, making one a modeh bemiktzat who must swear that he doesn’t owe the full amount), and admission (the part he admits) is (alteast) with a pruta (the smallest coin, on thirty-second of a ma’ah).  There are five (things which are contingent on the value of) prutot, (and) they are, admission is to the value of a pruta, a woman is betrothed with the value of a pruta, if one benefits from the value of a pruta of holy property it is me’ila, one who finds (something of) the value of a pruta must return it, and one who steals the value of a pruta and swears to him (the one he stole from) must go after him (to return it) even to Maday.", 
        "There are five (instances of one who must pay) chomesh (an extra fifth on the principal), (and) they are, one who eats truma (a portion removed for the kohanim), trumat ma’aser (a part remove by the levi’im for the kohanim) of dmai (food which we a doubtful of the tithing), challa (a part removed from doughs for kohanim), and bikurim (first fruits which must be brought to the Beit Hamikdash and then eaten), he adds chomesh; one who redeems his neta revai (the fourth year of produce since planting which must be brought to Yerushalayim) and his ma’aser sheni (a tithe which must be eaten in Yerushalayim, both of these may be redeemed such that the produce may be eaten and one spends the money in Yerushalayim), he adds chomesh; one who redeems from his hekdesh (if he decides he wants to use property he consecrated for holy use) he adds chomesh; and one who steals the value of a pruta from his friend but swears to him (that he did not steal), he adds chomesh (when he repays).", 
        "These things do not have ona’ah, slaves, documents (which function as bonds), lands, and consecrated property.  They do not have the restitution of kefel (if they are stolen), and not the restitution of four or five.  An unpaid guardian doesn’t swear (that he was negligent if they were ruined or lost in his care) and one who takes a salary (as a guardian) does not pay (if these were ruined or lost in his care).  Rabi Shimon says, holy things which he is obligated in their responsibility (if they cannot be brought he must provide a replacement) have ona’ah, and those which he is not obligated in their responsibility, they don’t have ona’ah.  Rabi Yehuda says, also one who sells a torah, animal, or pearls, they do not have ona’ah.  They said to him, they didn’t say (that there is no ona’ah) other than these (which were stated at the beginning of the mishna).", 
        "Just as ona’ah is in buying and selling, so too there is ona’ah in words.  One may not say to him (another person), how much is this object, if he does not want to buy.  If he (the one being talked to) was a person of repentance (who had repented from prior evil ways), one may not say to him remember your previous deeds.  If he is the child of converts, one may not say to him, remember the deeds of your forefathers, as it says, “and a convert you shall not wrong and you shall not pressure him.”", 
        "One may not mix fruits (of one field) with fruits (of another field if he markets them as coming from one field), even new (grain which cannot be eaten until Pesach passes) with new, and there is no need to say new with old.  In truth, by wine they allowed to mix hard (strong wine) with soft, because it improves it.  One may not mix the sediment from wine with (other) wine, but he gives him its sediment (with the wine it was part of).  One who mixed water with his wine, he may not sell it in a store unless he informs him (the customer), and not a merchant, even if he informs him, for it is nothing other than a way to cheat with it. (But) a place where they had a custom to put water in the wine, they may put (water in the wine).", 
        "A merchant may take (grain) from five threshing floors and put into one storeroom, or from give winepresses and put into one barrel, as long as he does not intend to mix (poor quality with better quality to mask it).  Rabi Yehuda says, a storekeeper may not give out toasted grain or nuts to children such that they will be accustomed to come to him, but the Chachamim allow.  And he may not lower the price (so people will come to him and then raise it), but the Chachamim remember him favorably.  One may not sort barley (to remove impurities when selling it) according to Abba Shaul, and Chachamim allow.  But they admit that he may not sort (only) what is at the top of the storeroom (which is seen by customers) for it nothing but stealing the eye (deceiving the customer into thinking all the barley is sorted).  One may not give a deceiving appearance to a person, animal, or vessels (to try to get a higher price when selling them)."
