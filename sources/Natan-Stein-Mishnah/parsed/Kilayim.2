        "Any se’ah worth of seeds that has a rova or more of a second type of seeds, he has to reduce it.  Rabi Yossi says, he must get rid of it.  Whether it’s one kind or two.  Rabi Shimon says it’s only one species.  Chachamim say if all the kilayim adds up to a rova.", 
        "What is this talking about?  Any mixture of grain and legumes.  What they really meant was seeds that aren’t eaten which make up 1/24 of the amount sown in a beit se’ah.  Rabi Shimon says, just as they were stringent by those seed, the are lenient by others, like flax (for three se’ah of flax is sown in a beit se’ah, so we need three rova for kilayim).", 
        "One’s field was sown with wheat and he decided to sow barley, he’ll wait until it becomes wormy, he’ll turn the soil, and he’ll plant.  If the wheat already sprouted, he can’t say I’ll plant and then plow, he has to plow first.  How much must he plow?  As the furrows are after the rain.  Abba Shual says, such that there won’t remain unplowed area greater than a rova in a se’ah.", 
        "He had sown and he decided to plant (with vines), he may not say, I’ll plant then plow, rather he plows first.  If it was planted and he decided to sow (with grain) he may not say, I’ll sow and then uproot, but rather he must uproot first.  If he wants, he can cut less than a tefach, sow, and then uproot.", 
        "If his field was planted with caraway or arum, he may not sow on top of them, because they don’t produce for three years.  Grain that had on it weeds of isatis, and so too if various weeds grew on the threshing floor, and so too if fenugreek grew weeds, he doesn’t have to weed them.  If he weeded or cut them, they say to him, uproot everything except for the one (desirable) kind.", 
        "One who wants to plant his field with beds of different species, Beit Shamay says, keep a distance of three open furrows, and Beit Hillel says the size of a yoke in the Sharon.  And what they say is similar.", 
        "If the head of a row of wheat entered into a row of barley, it is permitted, because it is recognized as the end of the field.  If his is wheat and his neighbor’s is a different species, he may plant the species that his neighbor has.  If they both have wheat, he may plant flax between them (because such little flax isn’t profitable, and isn’t for sale) but not any other species.  Rabi Shimon says, it can be linseed or any species.  Rabi Yossi says, even in the middle of his field he can test it with a bed of flax (to see if flax can be grown).", 
        "One may not plant mustard or safflower next to a grain field, but you can by a field of vegetables.  One may plant a different seed close to a fallow field, a plowed field, a stone fence, a road, a fence at least ten tfachim tall, a ditch ten tfachim deep and four wide, a tree that droops close to the ground, and a rock that is taller than ten tfachim and wider than four,", 
        "One who wants to lay out his field in beds of different species makes 24 patches in a beit se’ah, each a beit rova, and you can plant whatever you want.  If there are one or two sections, he can plant mustard.  If it’s three, he can’t, because it looks like a mustard field, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, nine patches are allowed (enough to segregate the mustards), ten are not.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, even if his field is a kor (30 se’ah) he may not make more than one patch.", 
        "Everything that is in a beit rova is calculated as part of the rova.  The spaces of grapes, graves, and rocks are also included.  Grain and grain must be separated by a beit rova, two vegetables, six tfachim.  A grain and a vegetable, beit rova.  Rabi Eliezer says, vegetable from grin is six tfachim.", 
        "Grain overhanging grain, vegetables overhanging vegetables, or one on the other is all allowed, except for Egyptian gourd.  Rabi Meir says, also the squash and the Egyptian bean, but I like tana kama’s opinion more."
