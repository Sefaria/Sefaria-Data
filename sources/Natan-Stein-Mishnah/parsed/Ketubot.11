        "A widow is maintained (given a stipend) from the (inherited) property of the orphans, the work of her hands if theirs, and they are not chayav to bury her.  Her heirs, who inherit her ktuba, are chayav to bury her.", 
        "A widow, whether from engagement (her husband died when they were engaged) or marriage, may sell (things from her husband’s estate to fund her maintenance or ktuba) without the (approval of the) court.  Rabi Shimon says, from marriage, she sells without the court, from engagement, she may not sell except with the court, because she does not get maintenance, and all who don’t have maintenance may not sell except with the court.", 
        "If she sold her ktuba or part of it, pledged her ktuba or part of it, or gave to someone else her ktuba or a part of it, she may not sell (property of her husband’s to finance) the rest except with the court.  And Chachamim say, she may sell even four or five times (and collect her ktuba in pieces), and sell for maintenance without the court and write (in the bill of sale), I sold for maintenance.  And a divorcee may only sell with the court.", 
        "A widow whose ktuba was worth two hundred (zuz), and she sold (property from her husband’s estate) worth a maneh for two hundred or worth two hundred for a maneh, she has received her ktuba (for in the first case she earned the full amount, and in the second case she took the full amount from the orphans).  If her ktuba was worth a maneh and she sold worth a maneh and a dinar for a maneh, her sale is invalid (for the orphans may claim she took one dinar too much from them), even if she says, I will return a dinar to them, it is invalid (for she would not be getting her full ktuba, the heirs can object).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, her sale always stands, until (her loss is so great that she doesn’t) leave there a field the size of nine kabim and a garden the size of half a kav, and according to Rabi Akiva a quarter (of a kav).  If her ktuba was four hundred zuz, and she sold to this one for a maneh, this one for a maneh, and the last one worth a maneh and a dinar, the (sale to) the last is invalid, and of all of them (the first three), their sale stands.", 
        "An assessment of judges who diminished by a sixth or increased by a sixth (a concept called ona’ah of selling for an unfair price), their sale is invalid.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, their sale is valid.  If so, why is the power of the court greater (that they can sell despite ona’ah)?  But if they made a letter of inspection (publicly declared the sale) even if they sold (property) worth a maneh for two hundred or worth two hundred for a maneh, their sale is valid.", 
        "One who refuses (an orphan girl who refuses a contracted marriage when she becomes an adult), a secondary (women who are assur due to a secondary, derabanan issur), and an aylonit (barren woman), she has no ktuba, no fruits (payment for what the husband gained from her nichsei tzon barzel), no maintenance, and no depreciation (payment for wear to nichsel melog).  And if from the outset he married her (knowing) she was an aylonit, she has a ktuba.  A widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee or chalutza to a lay kohen, a mamzeret or netina to a yisra’el, or a bat yisra’el to a natin or a mamzer, she has a ktuba."
