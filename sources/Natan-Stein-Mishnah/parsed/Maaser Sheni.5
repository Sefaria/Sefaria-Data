        "A vineyard in its fourth year is marked off with clods of earth, an orla (young tree) is marked off with clay, and graves with lime which one dissolves and pours out.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, what is this talking about?  In shvi’it.  The scrupulous put down money and say, whatever will be gathered from this (vineyard, in its fourth year) is redeemed on this money.", 
        "Kerem revai (a fourth year vineyard) must be brought to Yerushalayim from a day’s journey in every direction.  And what were it limits?  Eilat from the south, Akrevat in the north, Lod from the west, and the Jordan in the east.  When produce (in Yerushalayim) became abundant, they instituted that the produce would be redeemed close to the wall.  And there was a condition in the matter, that whenever they want, they could return the matter to the way it was.  Rabi Yossi says, since the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed we had this condition, and the condition was that when the Beit Hamikdash is rebuilt, it will return to as it were.", 
        "Kerem revai, Beit Shamay says, it doesn’t have chomesh or biur.  And Beit Hillel says it does.  Beit Shamay says, it has peret and olelet, and the poor redeem for themselves.  Beit Hillel says, it may all go to the winepress.", 
        "How does one redeem neta revai?  He puts down a basket in from of three (judges) and says, how much does a person want for a sela one the condition that he would pay all the expenses (that are involved in getting to the fruit).  And he puts the money down in front of them and says, anything taken from this (fruit) is redeemed on this money, so and so baskets for a sela.", 
        "On shvi’it, he redeems for its value.  And if everything is hefker, he only has the costs of harvesting.  One who redeems his leket revai adds a fifth whether it’s his or it was given to him as a gift.", 
        "Erev Pesach (the first day) of the fourth year and shvi’it there was biur.  What was biur?  We give truma and trumat ma’aser to their owners (kohanim), ma’aser rishon to its owners (levi’im), and ma’aser ani to its owners (the poor), and ma’aser sheni and bikurim are removed everywhere.  Rabi Shimon says the bikurim are given to the kohanim as with ma’aser.  A cooked dish, Beit Shamay says, you must do biur, but Beit Hillel says, it is as if removed.", 
        "One who has produce at this time (after the destruction of the Beit Hamikdash) and the time of biur comes, Beit Shamay says, one must redeem it for money.  Beit Hillel says, whether money or produce (he sets it aside and doesn’t use it).", 
        "Rabi Yehuda said, they used to send people to field owners in the country to tell them, hurry up and tithe your produce before the time of biur comes.  (This happened) until Rabbi Akiva came and taught, any produce which didn’t come into the season of ma’aser is patur from biur.", 
        "One whose produce is far from him (such that he did not give over the tithes he separated), he must specify them.  Once Raban Gamliel and the Zekenim were traveling in a ship and Raban Gamliel said, a tithe which I will measure is for Yehoshua, and the space is rented to him (so he acquires on it), another tithe which I will measure is for Akiva ben Yosef, who will take it on behalf of the poor, and its place is rented to him.  Rabi Yehoshua said, ma’aser which I will measure is given to Elazar ben Azariah, and they took rent from one another.", 
        "At mincha of the last day of Yom Tov (of Pesach) they would confess.  How would they confess?  (They would say) “I have removed the kodesh from my house,” this is ma’aser sheni and neta revai.  “And I gave it to a levi,” this is ma’aser for a levi.  “And I have given it,” this is truma and trumat ma’aser.  “For the convert, orphan, and widow,” this is ma’aser ani, the leket, shichicha, and the pe’ah even though one doesn’t impede a confession.  “From the house,” this is challa.", 
        "“According to all of the mitzvot you commanded us,” for if he did ma’aser sheni before ma’aser rishon, he cannot confess.  “I didn’t transgress your mitzvot,” I didn’t take from one species on account of another, not from the disconnected on what is connected to the ground or vice versa, or from the new for the old or vice versa.  “And I didn’t forget,” I didn’t forget to bless You and mention Your name about it.", 
        "“I didn’t eat in grieving from it,” behold, if he ate from it in grieving, he cannot confess.  “And I didn’t remove from it while tame,” behold, if he removed from it while tame, he cannot confess.  “And I didn’t give from it to the dead,” I didn’t take from it a coffin or shrouds for the dead, and I didn’t give to others who were grieving.  “I listened to the voice of Hashem my God,” I brought to the Beit Hamikdash.  “I did all which He commanded me,” I was happy and helped others be happy through it.", 
        "“Look from Your holy house, from heaven,” we did what You ruled upon us, so You do what you promised us, “look from Your holy house, from heaven and bless your nation Yisra’el,” our sons and daughters.  “And the land which You have given us,” with dew and rain and with the kids of animals.  “Just as You promised our forefathers a land flowing with milk and honey,” such that You might give flavor in the produce.", 
        "From here they said, a yisra’el and a mamzer confess, but converts and freedmen don’t, for they hold no part in the land.  Rabi Meir says, also not kohanim and levi’im, for they don’t hold a part of the land.  Rabi Yossi said, they have cities with lots.", 
        "Yochanan the kohen gadol abolished the confession over ma’aser.  He also nullified the awakeners (a line in one of the daily songs about Hashem sleeping) and the strikers (of a korban between its eyes to daze before slaughter).  And until his days the striking of the hammer (on chol hamo’ed) was (heard) in Yerushalayim.  And in his days, nobody had to ask about dmai (when buying, because only trumat ma’aser and ma’aser sheni had to be taken, the others could be eaten unless a levi or ani could prove that it was tevel)."
