        "A widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee or chalitza to a lay kohen, and she brought in for him (to the marriage) (nichsei) melog slaves and tzon barzel slaves the melog slaves (who are not at all the husband’s property) may not eat truma, and the tzon barzel slaves (who the husband is responsible for) may.  And these are melog slaves, if they died, they died for her (she loses the value) and if they increased (in number) they increased for her (she benefits).  Even though he is responsible for their food, they may not eat truma.  And these are tzon barzel slaves, if they died, they died for him, and if they increased, they increased for him.  Since he is chayav in their responsibilities, behold these eat truma.", 
        "The daughter of a yisra’el who married a kohen and she brought in slaves for him whether melog slaves or tzon barzel slaves, they may eat truma.  And the daughter of a kohen who married a yisra’el and brought in for him slaves whether melog slaves or tzon barzel slaves, behold these will not eat truma.", 
        "The daughter of a yisra’el who married a kohen and he died and left her pregnant, the slaves do not eat truma because of the part of the baby (for he is an heir) for the baby makes pasul and does not (allow to) feed (slaves with truma, since he is unborn, so it is as if the mother has no children and therefore reverts to being a bat yisra’el), according to Rabi Yossi.  They said to him, after you testified to us about the daughter of a yisra’el to a kohen, even a bat kohen to a kohen, and he died and left her pregnant, the slaves may not eat truma, because of the part of the baby.", 
        "The (unborn) baby, yavam, fiancée, deaf-dumb, and one nine years and one day old (after which sex is legally valid), invalidate and don’t allow to eat.  (Other cases with this ruling are) if it’s a doubt whether he is nine years and one day old or not, or a doubt whether two hairs have issued forth (two pubic hairs are a sign of puberty) or not.  If the house fell on him and on the daughter of his brother (who was his wife) and it isn’t known who died first, her rival gets chalitza but not yibum (because there is a doubt if it is allowed or not).", 
        "A rapist, a seducer, and a mentally infirm person, they don’t invalidate and they don’t feed.  And if they are not fit to come into yisra’el (i.e. a mamzer) behold these invalidate.  How?  A yisra’el who has sex with the daughter of a kohen, she may eat truma.  If she got pregnant, she may not eat truma (of the unborn baby invalidates).  If she had an abortion, she may eat.  A kohen who has sex with the daughter of a yisra’el may not eat truma.  If she got pregnant, she may not eat.  If she gave birth, she may eat.  It is found that the strength of the son is greater than the strength of the father.  A slave invalidates (the daughter of a kohen from eating truma) by having sex, but does not invalidate based on children.  How so?  The daughter of a yisra’el to a kohen, the daughter of a kohen to a yisra’el, she gave birth to a son from him, the son went and had sex with a maidservant, and she had a son from him, behold he is a slave.  If the mother of her father was a (case of a) bat yisra’el to a kohen, she may not eat truma, a bat kohen to a yisra’el, she may eat truma.  A mamzer invalidates and feeds.  How?  A bat yisra’el to a kohen, and a bat kohen to a yisra’el, a daughter was born to her, and the daughter went and married a slave or a non-Jew, behold it is a mamzer.  If the mother of her mother was a bat yisra’el to a kohen, she may eat truma, a bat kohen to a yisra’el, she may not eat truma.", 
        "A kohen gadol, there are times he invalidates.  How?  A bat kohen to a yisra’el, a daughter was born to her, the daughter went and married a kohen, and a son was born to her, behold this one is fit to be a kohen gadol standing and serving on the mizbe’ach, he feeds his mother and invalidates his mother’s mother (even if his mother died, for she could return to her family if not for him, the son), and this (the grandmother) says, (let there) not (be many) like my son (grandson) the kohen gadol, for he invalidates me from truma."
