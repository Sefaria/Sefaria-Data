        "A deaf-dumb who married a woman of sound senses and a man of sound senses who married a deaf-dumb, if he wants, he exits, and if he wants, he keeps, for just as he (the deaf-dumb) marries with signs, so too he can remove with signs.  A man of sound senses who married a woman of sound senses and she became a deaf dumb, if he wants he may exit, and if he wants he may keep.  If she became mentally infirm, he may not exit.  If he became a deaf-dumb or mentally infirm, he may never send her away.  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri said, why can a woman who became a deaf-dumb be removed, but a man who became deaf-dumb may not remove?  They said to him, a man divorcing is not the same as a woman divorcing, for she is removed willingly or unwillingly, and he only sends away willingly.",
