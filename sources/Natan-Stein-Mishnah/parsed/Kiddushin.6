        "How is the foot mu’ad to break while walking?  An animal is mu’ad to walk in its normal manner and break, (but) if it kicked or bits sprayed from under its foot and broke vessels, he pays half the damage.  If it stepped on the vessel and broke it, and it fell onto another vessel and broke that, one the first he pays the full damage and on the last he pays half damage.  Chickens are mu’ad to go in their normal manner and to break.  If a cord was tied on its foot, or it was scratching and breaking vessels (because it made them hit something hard and break) he pays half the damage.", 
        "How is the tooth mu’ad to eat that which is fit for it?  An animal is mu’ad to eat fruits and vegetables.  If it ate clothes or vessels, he pays half damage.  What is this talking about?  On the property of the damaged, but in the public domain, he is exempt, but if it benefited, he pays what it benefited.  How does he pay what it benefited?  If it ate from the open square, he pays what is benefited (the money he saved by not having to feed the animal), from the sides of the open square, he pays what it damaged, from the storefront, he pays what it benefited, from inside the store, he pays what it damaged.", 
        "The dog and the kid that jumped from the top of the roof (where animals would sometimes be kept) and broke vessels, he pays the full damage, since they are mu’ad (they are known to jump off sometimes).  A dog who took a cake, went to a pile of grain, ate the cake, and lit the pile of grain, for the cake he pays the full damage, and on the pile of grain he pays half the damage.", 
        "Which is a tam and which is a mu’ad (by goring)?  Mu’ad (is) all who they testified about it (goring on) three days, and tam is when he returns from it (goring) for three days, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Meir says, mu’ad, that they testified about it three times, and tam, any which the children pet it and it does not gore.", 
        "An ox which damages in the domain of the damaged (which is considered mu’ad), how?  It gored, pushed, bit, lay down, or kicked in the public domain, he (the owner) pays half the damage, (if it damaged) in the domain of the damaged, Rabi Tarfon says, he pays the full damage, and Chachamim say half the damage.  Rabi Tarfon said to them, just as in the place it (the torah) made lenient by tooth and foot (eating or walking on something) when in the public domain and he is patur, and it made strict in the domain of the damaged where he pays the full damage, isn’t it logical that we are strict on it (the types of damage he pays half damage for in the public domain) in the domain of the damaged that he should pay the full damage?  They said to him, it is sufficient for what we infer to be like (in terms of payment) what we inferred from, just as in the public domain he pays half the damage, so too in the domain of the damaged he pays half the damage.  He said to them, I will not infer (laws of) horn (goring) from horn, I will infer horn from foot (walking on something).  Just as a place where it was lenient on tooth and foot in the public domain (for the owner is exempt) it was strict about horn (he pays half damage), a place where it was stringent by tooth and foot in the domain of the damaged, isn’t is logical that we should be strict by horn?  They said to him, it is enough for what we infer to be like what we inferred from, just as in the public domain he pays half the damage, so too in the domain of the damaged he pays half the damage.", 
        "A person is always mu’ad, whether (he damaged) accidentally or intentionally, whether awake or asleep.  If he blinded the eye of his friend (unintentionally) or broke his vessels, he pays full damage (even for unintentional bodily damage, which generally incurs other payments)."
