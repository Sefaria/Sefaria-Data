        "One who sows truma (seed), if by accident, he must plow it under, if intentionally, he must let it grow (and it is truma).  If it reached a third of its growth, whether he planted it unintentionally or intentionally,  he must let it grow. And flax, even intentionally he must plow it under.", 
        "And (planted truma) is chayav in leket, shichicha, and pe’ah, and the poor yisra’elim and kohanim ay glean, and the poor yisra’elim sell theirs to kohanim for the price of truma and the money is for them.  Rabi Tarfon says, only the poor kohanim may take, lest the yisra’elim forget and eat it.  Rabi Akiva said to him, if so, only tahor kohanim may take.", 
        "And it (the sown truma) is chayav in ma’asrot and ma’aser ani, and poor yisra’elim and kohanim take, and the poor yisra’elim sell to kohanim for the price of truma, and the money is for them.  One who flails the truma plants by hand is praiseworthy (because the animals may not eat it, so he must muzzle them, which is assur).  How does he thresh them (with animals)?  He hangs baskets around the necks of the animals, and puts into them from the same type of food, so he doesn’t muzzle the animal and he doesn’t feed it truma.", 
        "The growth of truma is truma, but the growth of that growth is chulin.  But tevel, ma’aser rishon, weeds from shvi’it, truma from outside Israel, meduma, and bikurim, their growth is chulin.  The growth of hekdesh and ma’aser sheni is chulin, and he redeems them when he plants it.", 
        "If there are one hundred beds of truma and one of chulin, all of them are allowed of a species that the seed disintegrates, but where the seed does not disintegrate, even if it is one hundred chulin and one truma, they are all assur.", 
        "Tevel, it’s growth is allowed in a species where the seed disintegrates, but in a species where the seed doesn’t disintegrate, its growth is assur.  What is a species where the seed does not disintegrate?  For example, luf, garlic, and onions.  Rabi Yehuda says, garlic is like barley (the seed disintegrates).", 
        "One who weeds with a non-Jew in alliums, even though the product is tevel (despite the fact that the non-Jew owns it), he may eat randomly.  Truma seedlings which became tame, if they were replanted, they become tahor and do not make tame.  They are assur to be eaten until the edible part had been cut out (and then will subsequently regrow).  Rabi Yehuda says, until he cuts out and repeats (a second time)."
