        "He would take her mincha from the Egyptian basket, put it into a service vessel, and put it in her hands.  And the kohen would place his hand under hers and wave it.", 
        "He waved and brought it, took a handful and burned it and the rest is fed to the kohanim.  He would have her drink, and afterwards offer the mincha.  Rabi Shimon says, he would bring her mincha and they have her drink, as it says, “and after he has the woman drink the water.”  If he had her drink and then brought the mincha, it’s valid.", 
        "If before the scroll was erased she said, I will not drink, he scroll is hidden (for it is holy), her mincha is scattered on the ashes (which were in a heap from korbanot), and her scroll is not valid to have any other sota drink with it.  If after the scroll was erased, she said, I am tame, the water is spilled out and her mincha is spread on the ashes.  If the scroll was erased and she said, I will not drink, they force her and make her drink against her will.", 
        "If she doesn’t manage to drink (much water) and her face becomes yellow, her eyes bulge, and she fills with veins (they are seen through her skin because of the swelling) they say, take her out, take her out, so that she does not make the courtyard tame.  If she had merit, it would suspend (the disfigurement) for her.  There is merit which suspends for one year, there is merit which lasts for two years, and there is merit which lasts for three years.  From here ben Azay says, a man is chayav to teach his daughter torah, so if she drinks, she will know her merit suspends for her.  Rabi Eliezer says, one who teaches his daughter torah, it is as if he taught her triviality.  Rabi Yehoshua says, a woman prefers on kav (as a standard of living) and cohabiting (with her husband) than nine kavim and abstinence (a woman prefers a lower standard of living and being married, for as the gemara in Mesechet Kiddushin teaches, women long for marriage).  He would say, a mentally unsound righteous person, a cunning wicked person, an abstinent woman, and the lashes of the Pharisees (those Pharisees who are false in their religion and inflict torture), these ruin the world.", 
        "Rabi Shimon says, merit does not suspend the bitter waters (those of the sota).  And if you say, merit suspends for the cursing waters, you weaken (the gravity of) the water before all women who drink and slander all the tahor women who drank, for people say, they are tame, rather it (their punishment) was suspended for them because of merit.  Rabi says, merit suspends the cursing waters, but she does not give birth and does not improve, rather she wastes away and goes on, and in the end she dies in that death.", 
        "If he mincha became tame before it was made kodesh in a (service) vessel, behold it is like all the menachot and it shall be redeemed.  And if from when it became kodesh in the vessel, behold it is like all of the menachot and shall be burnt.  And these are (those) that their menachot are burnt, one who says, I am tame to you; if witnesses come on her that she is tame, one who says, I will not drink; and one whose husband does not want to make her drink; and that her husband had sex with her on the way.  And all those married to kohanim, their mincha’ot are burnt.", 
        "A bat yisra’el who married a kohen, her mincha is burnt.  And a kohenet who married a yisra’el, he mincha is eaten.  What is the difference between a kohen and a kohenet?  The mincha of a kohenet is eaten, and the mincha of a kohen is (never) eaten.  A kohenet may become a chalal (if she has sex with one forbidden to her, she loses her status) and a kohen can never become a chalal (unless he is born one).  A kohenet can become tame for the dead, and a kohen cannot become tame for the dead.  A kohen eats the holy of holies (korbanot which are of the highest level) and a kohenet does not eat the holy of holies.", 
        "What is the difference between a man and a woman?  A man loosens his hair and tears his clothes (when he is a metzora) and a woman does not loosen her hair or tear her clothes.  A man may vow his son a nazir, and a woman may not vow her daughter a nezira.  A man can shave on account of his father’s nezirut, and a woman may not shave on account of her father’s nezirut.  A man may sell his daughter, and a woman does not sell her daughter.  A man may marry (off) his daughter, but a woman cannot marry her daughter.  A man is stoned naked, and a woman is not stoned naked,  A man is hung (after stoning) and a woman is not hung.  A man is sold for his theft, and a woman is not sold for her theft."
