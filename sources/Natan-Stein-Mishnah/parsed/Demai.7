        "One who is invited to the house of a person he doesn’t trust by ma’asrot says erev Shabbat, what I will separate tomorrow is ma’aser, and the adjoining will be the rest of the ma’aser, that which I took ma’aser from I did trumat ma’aser on it, and ma’aser sheni is in such and such a part, and I redeem it with money.", 
        "When they pour him wine, he says, what I am going to leave in the bottom of the cup is ma’aser, and the rest of the ma’aser is touching it, what I took ma’aser on has trumat ma’aser taken,  and ma’aser sheni I drank and I redeem it with money.", 
        "A laborer who doesn’t trust his boss, takes a dried fig an says, this and the next nine I will take are ma’aser on the 90 I will eat, this is trumat ma’aser on them,, and ma’aser sheni is at the end, and is redeemed for money.  So he saves one fig.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, he shouldn’t save, because he’s lessening the work for the owner.  Rabi Yossi says, he shouldn’t save, because the beit din said so.", 
        "One who buys wine from a kuti says, two lug which I am going to separate, that is the truma, and a tenth of that is ma’aser, and nine are ma’aser sheni.  He redeems, and then he can drink it.", 
        "One had tevel figs in his house, and he’s in the beit midrash or the field.  He says, two figs that I will separate are truma, and ten are ma’aser rishon, and nine are ma’aser sheni.  If they are dmai he says, what I will separate tomorrow is ma’aser, and the rest of the ma’aser is next to it, what I did ma’aser on it has trumat ma’aser done on it, and the ma’aser sheni is in such and such a place, and is redeemed for money.", 
        "There were two baskets of tevel in front of him, and he said, the ma’asrot of this basket are in that basket, the first is me’usar.  If he said the ma’aser of this one is in that and of that is in that, only the first (this) is me’usar, if he says the ma’aser of each is in the other, he has only said that the ma’aser has to come from those baskets.", 
        "One hundred tevel mixed with one hundred chulin, he removes 101 ( to make sure he’s taking trumat ma’aser from the tevel).  If it’s ma’aser instead of chulin, he takes out 101.  One hundred of fully me’usar chulin, and one hundred ma’aser, he takes 110.  One hundred tevel and ninety ma’aser, ninety tevel and eighty ma’aser, he didn’t lose anything.  This is the general rule, as long as the tevel is greater, he loses nothing.", 
        "One who has ten rows of ten jugs of wine and said, one exterior row is ma’aser, and we don’t know which row, he takes two jars from opposite corners.  If he said, half of one of the external rows is ma’aser, and we don’t know which side, he takes a barrel from each corner.  If he says one row is ma’aser, and we don’t know which row, he takes one diagonal.  If he says half of one row is ma’aser, and we don’t know which one, you take both diagonals.  If he says one barrel is ma’aser, and we don’t know which barrel, he takes from each barrel."
