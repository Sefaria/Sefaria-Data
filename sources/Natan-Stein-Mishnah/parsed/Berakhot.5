        "When saying shmone esrey, be in the right mindset.  Chasidim would prepare an hour.  Even if a king said hello or a snake was on him, he shouldn’t stop.", 
        "Geshem is in tchiyat hameitim, ask for it in mevarech hashanim, and ata chonantanu is in chonen hada’at.  Rabi Akiva makes it its own bracha.  Rabi Eliezer says in modim.", 
        "Certain tfilot aren’t ok.  If the shatz made a mistake, one takes his place and doesn’t refuse.  You start with the bracha where he faltered.", 
        "The shatz doesn’t say amen after duchening, so he doesn’t get confused.  If he’s the only kohen, he doesn’t raise his hands unless he knows he won’t get confused.", 
        "It’s a bad sign to make a mistake in tfilah.  If it’s the shatz, it’s bad for the tzibur.  Rabi Chanina ben Dosa would pray for the sick and knew who would live based on whether the tfilah went smoothly or not."
