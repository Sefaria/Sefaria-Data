        "There are two oaths which are four, the oath, I will eat, and, I will not eat and, I ate, and, I didn’t eat.  If he swore he didn’t eat, if he ate at all, he’s chayav, according to Rabi Akiva.  They said to Rabi Akiva, where (else) have we found that one who eats at all is chayav, such that this one is chayav?  Rabi Akiva said to them, where (else) do we found where one speaks and brings a korban, for this one speaks and gives a korban?  If he swore he didn’t eat and he ate and drank, he is only chayav one.  If he swore he won’t eat and he won’t drink, and he ate and drank, he’s chayav two.", 
        "If he swore he didn’t eat, and he ate wheat bread, barley bread, and spelt bread, he is only chayav one.  If he swore he wouldn’t eat wheat bread, barley bread, and spelt bread, and he ate, he is chayav on each.", 
        "If he swore he won’t drink, and he drank many different drinks, he is only chayav one.  If he swore he wouldn’t drink wine, oil, and honey and he drank, he is chayav on each one.", 
        "If he swore her won’t eat, and he ate foods which aren’t fit to be eaten and he drank drinks which aren’t fit to be drunk, he’s patur.  If he swore he didn’t eat, and he ate animals which died naturally or were torn, sheketz and remes, he’s chayav, and Rabi Shimon exempts.  One said, konam (a form of oath) that my wife will not benefit from me if I have eaten today and he ate animals which died naturally or were torn, sheketz and remes, he is assur to his wife.", 
        "(It is the same) whether his things, others’ things, things which have substance, or things which have no substance.  How?  If he said, a swear that I will give so-and-so (a person) and that I won’t give, that I gave and that I didn’t give, that I will sleep and that I won’t sleep, that I slept and that I didn’t sleep, that I will throw a pebble into the sea and that I won’t throw, and that I threw and that I didn’t throw.  Rabi Yishma’el says, he isn’t chayav unless it is on the future, as it says, “to make evil or to make good (both future).”  Rabi Akiva said to him, if so, it should only be for things which have to do with evil and good, things which don’t have in them evil or good, from where do we get them?  He said to him, from an inclusion in the text.  He said (back) to him, if there is an inclusion for that (all things) there should also be an inclusion for that (the past).", 
        "He swore to neglect a mitzva, and he didn’t neglect, he’s patur.  To fulfill and he didn’t fulfill, he’s patur.  There was (a thought) in the law that he should be chayav, according to the words of Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira, for Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira said, just as he is liable for something which he isn’t sworn to hold from Har Sinai, a mitzva which he is sworn to hold from Har Sinai, isn’t it logical that he should be chayav for it?  They said to him, no, if you spoke about optional oaths, for here he made a negative commandment like a positive, but you can say in the oath of a mitzva, where you didn’t make a negative commandment like a positive, for if he swore to neglect and he didn’t neglect, he’s patur.", 
        "(If one says), an oath that I won’t eat this loaf, an oath that I won’t eat it, an oath that I won’t eat it, he is only chayav one.  This is a spoken oath which one is chayav lashes on if he transgressed intentionally and a graded offering if he transgressed accidentally.  A vain oath, one is chayav Makot if he intentionally (transgressed) and if accidental, he’s patur.", 
        "What is a vain oath?  He swore changing something that is known to people, he said about a stone pillar that it is gold, on a man that he is a woman, and on a woman that she is a man.  He swore of something that isn’t possible, if I didn’t see a camel floating in the air or, I have not seen a snake like the beam of an olive press.  He said to witnesses, come and testify, (and they said we made) an oath that we will not give testimony for you.  He swore to nullify a mitzva, not to make a sukka, not to take lulav, and not to wear tfillin, this is a vain oath, and one is chayav on it if intentionally lashes and if accidentally he’s patur.", 
        "An oath that he will eat this loaf and then that he won’t eat it, the first is a spoken oath, and the second is a vain oath.  If he ate it, he transgressed a vain oath, if he didn’t he transgressed on a spoken oath.", 
        "A spoken oath applies to men and women, with non-relatives and relatives, with valid (witnesses) or invalid, before a court or not, based on itself.  One is chayav upon it (transgressing) intentionally lashes, and accidentally a graded korban.", 
        "Yud A vain oath applies to men and women, with non-relatives and relatives, with valid (witnesses) or invalid, before a court or not, and based on itself, and one is chayav for (transgressing) intentionally Makot, and if accidentally, he’s patur.  Whether this or that (kind of oath), one who is sworn by other people is chayav.  How?  HE said, I didn’t eat today and I didn’t put on tfillin today, if I make an oath on him and he says amen he’s chayav."
