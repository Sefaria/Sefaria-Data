        "The holy of holies which were slaughtered on top of the mizbe’ach, Rabi Yossi says, it is as if they were slaughtered in the north.  Rabi Yossi bar Yehuda says, from half the mizbe’ach and north is like the north, from half the mizbe’ach and south is like the south (which is invalid).  The menachot had handfuls (taken from them) anywhere in the courtyard, were eaten within the curtains, by male kohanim, with any preparation, for one day and one night until midnight.", 
        "The chatat of fowl was made (valid with melika by squeezing its blood) on the southwestern corner (of the mizbe’ach), it is valid in any place, but this was its (designated) place.  And for three things that corner was used on the bottom, and for three things on top.  On the bottom, the chatat of fowl, bringing near (a mincha before taking a handful), and (spilling of) the leftovers of the blood.  On top, the libation of water, (the libation) of wine, and the olah of fowl when it is much (too many) in the east (its usual place).", 
        "All who go up on the mizbe’ach go up on the right (part of the ramp), circle, and go down on the left, except those who go up for these three things (water libation, wine libation, and olah of fowl), for they would go up and return on their heels (turn around).", 
        "A chatat of fowl, how was it done?  He (a kohen) would do melika (kill the bird by making a slit) on its head near the back of its head, but not separating (tearing it apart).  He would sprinkle from its blood on the wall of the mizbe’ach.  The leftovers of the boll were drained at the base, and the mizbe’ach got nothing but its blood, it is all for the kohanim.", 
        "An olah of fowl, how was it done?  He would go up on the ramp, turn to circle (the mizbe’ach), come to the southeastern corner, and do melika on its head next to the back of its neck and separate.  He would drain its blood on the wall of the mizbe’ach.  He would take the head, circled the place of melika on the mizbe’ach, rubbed it (the head) with salt, and threw it in the fire.  The body came to him, he removed its crop, feathers, and entrails which came out with it (the crop), and threw it on the place of the ashes.  He would slit (the body) but did not separate, but if he separated, it’s valid.  He would rub it with salt and throw it in the fire.", 
        "If he did not remove the crop, the feathers, or the entrails which came out with it, did not rub it with salt, or did anything different after he drained its blood, it is valid.  If he separated (the head) with a chatat or did not separate with an olah, he invalidated it.  If he drained the blood of the head but didn’t drain the blood of the body, it is invalid.  If he drained the blood of the body but didn’t drain the blood of the head, it is valid.", 
        "A chatat of fowl which he did melika on not (with an intention) for its sake, drained its blood not for its sake, for its sake and (then) not for its sake, not for its sake and for its sake, it is invalid.  With an olah of fowl, it is valid, only it did not go up for the owners (fulfill their obligation).  Whether a chatat of fowl or an olah of fowl which he did melika on or drained their blood (with an intention) to eat a thing the way of which it is to be eaten or to burn a thing which its way is to be burnt outside of its place, it is invalid and there is not karet.  (If he intention) was outside of its time, it is pigul and on is chayav karet on it, as long as he offered the permitted in its way (it has no other invalidation).  How does he offer the permitted in its way?  If he did melika in silence (with no intention) and drained the blood (with an intention for) outside of its time, he did melika out of its time and drained the blood in silence, of he did melika and drained the blood outside of its time, this is one who offered the permitted in its way.  How did he not offer the permitted in its way?  If he did melika outside its place and drained the blood outside its time, he did melika outside its time and drained its blood outside its place, he did melika and drained the blood outside its place, a chatat of fowl which he did melika on not for its sake and drained its blood outside its time, (a chatat that) he did melika outside its time and drained its blood not for its sake, or he did melika and drained its blood not for its sake, this is one who did not offer the permitted in its way.  (If he intended) to eat a kzayit outside and a (then) kzayit tomorrow, a kzayit tomorrow and a kzayit outside, like half an olive outside and like half an olive tomorrow, or like half an olive tomorrow and like half an olive outside, it is pasul but there is not karet in it.  Rabi Yehuda said, this is the general rule, if he thought about time came before his thought of the place, it is pigul and one is chayav karet from (eating) it, but id the thought of the place came before the thought of the time, it is pasul but there is no karet.  Chachamim say, this and that are pasul and there is no karet.  (If one intends) to eat like half an olive and to burn like half an olive, it is kasher, for eating and burning do not combine."
