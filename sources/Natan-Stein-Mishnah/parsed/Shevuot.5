        "The oath of a deposit applies to men and women, non-relatives and relatives, kosher and pasul (witnesses), in court and out of court, and from his mouth and from another’s mouth, and he is only chayav when he denies it in court according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, whether from his moth or from others’ mouths, since he denied it, he’s chayav.  He is chayav on intentionally swearing and on it accidentally but intentionally (denied) the deposit, but he’s not chayav on doing it accidentally.  And what is he chayav if on doing it intentionally?  A asham of (the value of) two shekels of silver.", 
        "How is the oath of a deposit (formulated)?  He said to him, give me the deposit which you have, he swears that it is not in his possession.  Or he said to him, I have nothing of yours, I (the second person) make him swear and he says amen, this is chayav,  If he made him swear five times, whether in court or not and he denied, he is chayav on each.  Rabi Shimon said, why?  Since he can repent and admit.", 
        "Five people were claiming from him, they said to him, give us the deposit that that we have (given into) your hand.  He swear that I don’t have in my hand, he is only chayav one.  If he swears that I don’t have in my hand, and not for you, and not for you etc. he is chayav on each of them.  Rabi Eliezer says, only if he says the oath at the end.  Rabi Shimon says, until he gives an oath for each one.  (If he says) give the deposit, loan, stolen item, and lost item that I have in your hand, if he swears that I don’t have of yours in my hand, he’s only chayav on.  If he swears that that I don’t have a deposit, loan, a stolen object, and a lost object, he is chayav on each one.  (If he says) give me the wheat, barley, and spelt of mine that you have un your hand.  If he swears, I don’t have for you in my hand, he is chayav one.  If he swears, you don’t have in my hand wheat, barley, and spelt, he is chayav on each.  Rabi Meir says, even if he says, wheat, barley, and spelt, his is chayav on each.", 
        "(If he says,) you raped and seduced my daughter, and he says, I didn’t rape and I didn’t seduce, if I make you swear, and he says amen, he’s chayav.  Rabbi Shimon exempts, for one does not pay a fine based on his own admission.  They said to him, even though he doesn’t pay a fine based on his own admission, he pays embarrassment and stigma based on his own admission.", 
        "(If he says) you stole my ox, and he says, I didn’t steal, I make him swear and he says amen, he’s chayav.  I stole but didn’t slaughter or sell, I swear and he says amen, he’s patur.  You killed his ox or my ox, and he says, I didn’t kill, I swear and he said amen, he’s chayav.  Your ox killed my slave and he said, it didn’t kill, I swear and he says amen, he’s patur.  You wounded me and made a wound in me and he says, I didn’t wound and make a wound, I swear and he says amen, he’s chayav.  His slave said to him, you knocked out my tooth and blinded my eye, and he says I didn’t knock out or blind, I swear and he says amen, he’s patur.  This is the general rule, anyone who would pay base on his own admission is chayav, and one who does not pay on his own admission is patur."
