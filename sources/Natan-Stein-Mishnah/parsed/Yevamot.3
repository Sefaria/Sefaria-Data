        "Four brothers, two of them married two sisters, and those married to the sisters died, behold these (women) get chalitza and not yibum, and if they went ahead and married, they exit (the marriage).  Rabi Eliezer says, Beit Shamay says, they stand (married), and Beit Hillel says, they exit (from the marriage).", 
        "If one of them was assur to one from an issur erva (inappropriate relations), he is assur to her and mutar to her sister, and the other one (brother) is assur to both of them (but he does chalitza).  (If the erva is) an issur of mitzva or an issur of kdusha, she gets chalitza but not yibum.", 
        "If one of them was assur to this (brother) an issur erva, and the other was assur to this (the other brother) an issur erva, the one who is assur to this one (of the brothers) is mutar to that one (the other brother), and the one who is assur to this (the other brother) is mutar to that.  And this is what they said, her sister who is her sister-in-law, either gets chalitza or yibum.", 
        "Three brothers, two are married to two sisters, a women and her daughter, a woman and her daughter’s daughter, or a woman and her son’s daughter, behold these get chalitza and not yibum, and Rabi Shimon exempts (from even chalitza).  If one of them was assur to him (the living brother) from an issur erva, he is assur with her but mutar with her sister.  If it’s an issur mitzva or an issur kdusha, she gets chalitza but not yibum.", 
        "Three brothers, two of them are married to two sisters, and the third is unmarried.  One of those married to the sisters died, and the unmarried one married her by a ma’amar (monetarily or by document without consummating the marriage) and then the other died, Beit Shamay says, his wife is with him and that one will be exempt because of (the fact that she is) the sister of his wife.  Beit Hillel says, he removes his wife with a get (because she is forbidden as the sister of a zkuka, one who needs yibum) and chalitza, and the sister of his brother with chalitza.  This is what they said, woe to him on his wife and woe to him on his brother’s wife.", 
        "Three brothers, two of them are married to two sisters, and one of them is married to an unrelated woman.  One of those married to the sisters died, and the one married to an unrelated woman married his wife (of the dead brother), and died.  This first is exempt (from yibum with the third brother) because of the sister of his wife, and the second because of her rival.  If he made her a contractual marriage and died, the unrelated wife gets chalitza but not yibum.  Three brothers, two of them married two sisters, and one of them is married to an unrelated woman, the one married to an unrelated woman died, and one of the others married his wife and died.  The first is exempt because of the sister of his wife, and the second is exempt because of her rival.  If he made her a contractual marriage and died, the unrelated wife gets chalitza but not yibum.", 
        "There are three brothers, two are married to two sisters and the third is married to an unrelated woman.  One of those married to the sisters died, the one married to an unrelated woman married his (the dead brother’s) wife, the wife of the second died (where the wife is the other sister), and then the one married to the unrelated woman died, behold this one (the living sister) is assur to him (the only living brother) forever, since she was assur to him for one hour (when the first brother died, she was assur as the sister of his wife).  Three brothers, two are married to two sister and the third is married to an unrelated woman.  One of those married to the sisters divorced his wife, the one married to an unrelated woman died, the divorcer married her, and died, this is what they said, and all who died or were divorced their rivals are mutar (she was never a rival of the living brother’s sister).", 
        "And all who had marriage or divorce in doubt, behold these are rivals who get chalitza but not yibum.  How is there a doubtful marriage?  If he threw her the marriage contract (while eight amot from her) and it’s a doubt if it is closer to him or closer to her, this is a doubtful marriage.  How is there a doubtful divorce?  He wrote it in his handwriting and does not have witnesses, there are witnesses but no date on it, or it has a date but there is only one witness, this is a doubtful divorce.", 
        "Three brothers married to three unrelated women, one of them died and the second made her a ma’amar (contractual marriage), and he died, she gets chalitza but not yibum, as it says, “and one of them died… her yevama (husband’s brother, who has to do yibum for her) will come upon her.”  For upon her is the necessity of one brother, and not that upon her is the necessity of two brothers (since both brothers had at least contractual marriages with her but not children, she would need yibum for each of the other brothers, which we learn is not necessary, and therefore her rival is exempt as well).  Rabi Shimon says, he marries whichever one he wants and does chalitza for the other.  Two brothers married two sisters, and one of them died, and after that the wife of the second died, behold this one is assur to him forever, since she was assur to him for an hour.", 
        "Two who married two women, and at the time they brought them into the chupa (a canopy used for performing marriage) they switched (the wife) of that for of that, they are chayav because of the wife of a man.  If they were brothers, (they are assur as) the wife of brothers.  And if they were sisters, the wife to her sister.  And if they were nidda (impure due to menstruation), because of nidda (for nidda women may not be able to be married).  And they separate for three months lest they are pregnant, and if they were minors not fit to give birth, they return them immediately.  And if they were kohanim, they are pasul from truma."
