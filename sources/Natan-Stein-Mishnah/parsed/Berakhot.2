        "You’re reading in the torah and come upon kriyat shma. You’re yotze if you have kavana.  Rav Meir and Rabi Yehuda discuss when you can greet people during shma.", 
        "Discusses the breaks in kriyat shma.  Why are the paragraphs of shma in the order they are?  Shma first because ol malchut shamayim before ol mitzvot.  Vehaya before vayomer because vehaya is day and night, and vayomer is only during the day.", 
        "If you don’t hear what you say, you’re yotze on kriyat shma.  Rav Yossi disagrees.  Rav Yossi – if you slur letters, yotze.  Rabi Yehuda disagrees.  Read sentences out of order, not yotze.  Made a mistake, go back to that place.", 
        "Artisans can read kriyat shma in high places, even though shmone esrey isn’t allowed.", 
        "A chatan is patur on kriyat shma until motzey Shabbat, until he consummates. Raban Gamliel read the first night of his marriage.  His student’s said, he’s patur, and he said, he didn’t want to miss a mitzvah even for an hour.", 
        "Raban Gamliel bathed the night his wife died.  His students said, avelim can’t bathe.  He said, I’m different, I’m sensitive (in my cleanliness).", 
        "Raban Gamliel sat shiva for his slave.  His students said, don’t you not?  He said, he’s different, he was worthy.", 
        "A chatan can read kriyat shma the first night.  Raban Gamliel said only righteous people."
