        "These are the appointed who were in the Beit Hamikdash, Yochanan ben Pinchas over the seals, Achiya over the libations, Matitya ben Shmu’el over the lots (for which kohanim have which duties), Patachia over the bird korbanot.  Patachia is Mordechai, so why was he called Patachia?  For he could open matters (patach) and explain them (though they had seemed unfathomable) and spoke seventy languages (referring to all languages).  Ben Achiya over one those with stomach illnesses (for the kohanim got sick often due to their diet and work), Nechunya digger of pits (to ensure sufficient water for Jerusalem), Gviri the herald, Ben Gever over the locking of gates, Ben Bevi over the wicks, Ben Arza over the cymbals, Hugras ben Levi over the singing, the house of Garmu over making the showbreads, the house of Avtinas over the making of the incense, Elazar over the curtains, and Pinchas over the garments.", 
        "They do not have less than three treasurers and seven supervisors (of the treasurers), and they do not make an authority (to collect money) over the community by money with less than two except for Ben Achiya who is over those with stomach illnesses and Elazar who is over the curtains, for those the majority of the public accepted upon themselves.", 
        "There were four seals in the Beit Hamikdash, and it was written on them, calf, ram, kid, (and) sinner.  Ben Azay says, they were five, and in Aramaic they said on them, calf, ram, kid, poor sinner, (and) rich sinner.  ‘Calf’ was used with libations of large and small cattle, male and female; ‘kid’ was used with the libations of large and small flocks, male and female, except for those of rams; ‘ram’ was used only with rams; and ‘sinner’ was used with the libations of the three animals of those with tzara’at.", 
        "One who needed libations (for a sacrifice) went to Yochanan who was in charge of the seals, gave him money, and got a seal from him.  He would go to Achiya who was in charge of the libations, give him the seal, and get a libation.  And at night, they would come to each other, Achiya would take out the seals and get money according to them.  If there was leftover, it was for the Beit Hamikdash, and if there was a deficit, Yochanan would pay from his house, for the Beit Hamikdash has the upper hand.", 
        "One who lost his seal, they would have him wait until evening and if (Yochanan) found extra (money) corresponding to his seal, they would give him, and if not, he wouldn’t have.  And they would write them name of the day on them (the seals) because of defrauders.", 
        "There were two chambers in the Beit Hamikdash, one the chamber of secrets and on the chamber of vessels.  The chamber of secrets, those who fear sin would put (charity) in it secretly, and the poor of good people would get money from it in secret.  The chamber of the vessels, anyone who donates a vessel throws it in, and once every thirty days the treasurers open it and anything they find a use for in the upkeep of the house the leave, and the rest they sell for their value and (the money) falls in with the chamber (fund) for the upkeep of the house."
