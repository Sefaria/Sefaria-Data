        "There is nothing between one who is vowed against benefit from his friend and one who is vowed against food from him other than the treading of the foot (entering his property) and vessels in which food is not made.  One who is vowed against the food of his friend, may not borrow from him a fine sieve, a coarse sieve, a millstone, and an oven, but he may lend him a robe, ring, cloak, earrings, and anything with which they do not make food.  A place where they rent things like that (non-food vessels), it’s assur (for him to borrow them).", 
        "One who is vows against benefiting from his friend may pay his shekel (for the census), repay his debt, and return him a lost item.  In a place where they take money for such an act, the benefit (money he would normally get) shall fall to hekdesh.", 
        "And he may separate his truma and ma’asrot with his knowledge, and may offer for him the birds of zavin, the birds of zavot, the birds of a woman who gave birth, chata’ot, and ashamot, may teach him midrash, halachot, and agadot, but may not teach him the text, but he may teach his sons and daughters text.  He may maintain his wife and children, even though he (the one he vowed again) is chayav in their maintenance.  But he may not maintain his animals, whether tame or tahor (species).  Rabi Eliezer says, he may maintain the tame, but he may not maintain the tahor.  They said to him, what is the difference between tame and tahor?  He said to them, for the tahor, its soul if for heaven and its body is his, and the tam, its soul and its body is for heaven.  They said to him, even the tame its soul is for heaven and its body is his, for if he wants, he can sell it to non-Jews or feed it to dogs.", 
        "One who vowed against benefiting from his friend and comes in to visit him, he stands but does not sit.  And he may heal him a healing for his life (he may save his life) but not a healing for (the man to benefit by getting) money (when he is healed from a non life-threatening condition).  He may bathe with him in a large pool but not a small one (or his entering would cause the water to rise).  He may sleep with him in a bed.  Rabi Yehuda says, during the summer, but not in the winter, because he makes him benefit (by warming him).  And he may recline with him on a bed and eat with him on the table, but not from a serving tray (for he may leave the best portion), but he may eat with him from the serving plate which goes back (where the leftover food after all have eaten as much as they want goes back to the host).  He may not eat with him from the food bowl which is before the workers (for if he eats less, the other will get more), and he may not make a furrow together (connected, for he will be loosening the earth at the ends) according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, he may make it far from the other (not next to each other while working).", 
        "One who vowed against benefiting from his friend before shvi’it does not go down into his field and may not eat from the overhanging (outside of the field’s limits), but on shvi’it, he does not go down into his field, but he may eat from the overhanging.  If he vowed against food from him before shvi’it, he may go down into his field, but not eat the produce, and on shvi’it, he goes down and eats.", 
        "One who vowed against benefiting from his friend may not lend him and may not borrow from him, may not loan him and may not borrow from him, and may not sell to him and may not buy from him.  He said to him, lend me your cow, he said back, she isn’t free.  He said, konam my field that if I will ever plow with it, if his way was to plow, he’s assur, and all people are mutar (to plow his field with that cow), and if it isn’t his way to blow, he and all people are assur.", 
        "One who vowed against benefiting from his friend and he has nothing to eat, he goes to the storekeeper and says, so-and-so is prevented by vow by benefiting me, and I don’t know what to do.  He (the shopkeeper) give him and comes and takes (money) from that one (the friend).  If he had to build his house, to put up his wall, to harvest his field, he goes to the workers and says, so-and-so is prevented by vow from me benefiting, and I don’t know what to do. They do with him, and they come and take money from the other.", 
        "They were walking on the road and he has nothing to eat, he may give the other as a gift, and that one is mutar in it.  If there is no other with them, he leaves it on a rock or on a fence and says, behold I relinquish this to anyone who wants it, and that one takes and eats, and Rabi Yossi forbids (this)."
