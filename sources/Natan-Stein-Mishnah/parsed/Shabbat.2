        "With what do we light, and with what do we not light?  One doesn’t light with cedar cambium (material between bark and heartwood), uncarded flax, silk waste product, a wick of willow cambium, a wick if the desert (a certain desert grass), or algae which is on the water (which grows off of boats).  Not with (liquid) tar, (liquid) wax, castor oil, oil which must be burnt (for ritual reasons), fat-tail (of an animal), or forbidden fats (chelev).  Nachum of Mede says, one may light with cooked chelev.  Chachamim say, whether cooked or not, one may not light with it.", 
        "One may not light with oil which must be burnt on Yom Tov.  Rabi Yishma’el says, one may not light with waste matter from pitch out of respect for Shabbat, and the Chachamim allow with all oils, sesame oil, nut oil, radish seed oil, fish oil, oil from the seeds of a (specific but unidentifiable) wild vine, waste matter from pitch, and gasoline.  Rabi Tarfon says, we don’t light except with olive oil.", 
        "Whatever comes from a tree (plant) one does not light with except flax.  Whatever comes from a tree (plant) does not become tame as a tent except flax.  A wick made of clothing, which was folded (and braided) but not singed (as a starter) Rabi Eliezer says, it’s tame and may not be lit.  Rabi Akiva says, it’s tahor and may be lit.", 
        "One may not make a hole in the shell of an egg, fill it with oil, and put it above the candle such that it will drip in, even if it is an earthenware (vessel), and Rabi Yehuda allows it.  But if the potter joined it, originally it’s mutar, since it is one vessel.  One may not fill a bowl with oil, put it beside the candle, and put the wick inside the bowl such that it will absorb.  And Rabi Yehuda allows it.", 
        "One who puts out a candle out of fear of goyim, bandits, evil spirit, or for a sick person who is sleeping is patur.  If he wants to spare the candle, the oil, or the wick, he’s chayav.  And Rabi Yehuda exempts all except the wick since it makes soot.", 
        "For three sins women die when they give birth, for not being careful with nidda, challa, and lighting candles.", 
        "There are three things a person must say on erev Shabbat when it gets dark (and they are), have you taken ma’aser?, have you made an eruv?, and light the candle!  If it is a doubt whether or not it’s (already) dark, one may not take ma’aser from certain (tevel), immerse vessels, or light the candles, but one may take ma’aser from dmai, make an eruv, and insulate hot food."
