        "Two women who made two kabim and they touched each other, even if they are one type (of flour) they’re patur.  When they belong to one woman, one type with the same type is chayav, but not of its type is patur.", 
        "What is a type with the same type?  Wheat doesn’t combine with any (different type) other than spelt.  Barley combines with all but wheat.  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri says, the rest of the types combine with each other.", 
        "Two kabim and a kav of rice or a kav of truma between them, they do not combine.  Something which its challa has been taken from it is in the middle, they combine, since it was already chayav by challa.", 
        "A kav of new and a kav of old which stuck together, Rabi Yishma’el says, he should take from the middle, and Chachamim say it’s assur, One who takes challa from a kav, Rabi Akiva says, it’s challa, and Chachamim say, it’s not challa.", 
        "Two kabim, each had challa taken from it, he returned and made them into one dough, Rabi Akiva makes patur, and Chachamim make chayav.  It’s stringency becomes its leniency (according to Rabi Akiva the challa was challa, so it makes this case lenient).", 
        "One takes the amount for challa from a dough which hasn’t had challa taken to make it tahor, to be separating (challa) on it, and he goes (on) with a dough of dmai until it rots, for challa of dmai is taken from the tahor on the tame and from that which isn’t nearby (this mishna on the whole is poorly understood).", 
        "A Jew who was a tenant for non-Jews in Syria, Rabi Eliezer makes their produce chayav in ma’asrot and shvi’it, and Raban Gamliel makes it patur.  Raban Gamliel says, there are two chalot in Syria (one to be burnt and one for the kohen) and Rabi Eliezer says one.  They adopted the leniency of Raban Gamliel and the one of Rabi Eliezer.  Then they returned to using the opinion of Raban Gamliel in both cases.", 
        "Raban Gamliel says, there are three lands for challa, from Israel until Kziv there is one challa.  From Kziv to the great river there are two chalot, one to be burnt and one for the kohen, the one to be burnt has a measurement, and the one for the kohen has no measurement.  From the river until and from Amana inward there are two chalot, one to be burnt and one for the kohen, to be burnt has no measurement, and for the kohen has a measure, and one who immersed that day may eat it.  Rabi Yossi says, he doesn’t even need to immerse.  It’s assur for a zav, zava, nidda, or woman who has just given birth.  And it may be eaten on the table with a zar and can be given to any kohen.", 
        "And these may be given to any kohen, devoted things, firstborn (kosher animals), redemption of a firstborn son, the redemption of the firstborn of a donkey, the shank bone, the cheeks, the maw (these three are given to the kohanim even from chulin), the first of the fleece (shorn), oil which must be burnt, holy things from the Beit Hamikdash, and the first fruits.  Rabi Yehuda prohibits by first fruits.  Truma vetches, Rabi Akiva allows but Chachamim prohibit.", 
        "Nitai of Tkoa brought chalot from Betar, and they didn’t accept from him.  The people of Alexandria brought their chalot from Alexandria and they didn’t accept from them.  The people of Har Tzvo’im brought their first fruits before Shavuot and they did not accept from them, because of the pasuk in the torah, and the holiday of harvest the first fruits of what you make, that which you sow in your field.", 
        "Ben Antinos brought first fruits from Bavel, and they did not accept from him.  Yosef the kohen brought the first fruits of wine and oil and they did not accept from him.  He even brought his sons and his household to make Pesach Katan (Sheni, a month later for those who were tame), but he returned them, lest if become an obligation.  Ariston brought first fruit from Apamiah, and they accepted from him, since they said, one who acquires in Syria is like one who acquires in a suburb of Yerushalayim."
