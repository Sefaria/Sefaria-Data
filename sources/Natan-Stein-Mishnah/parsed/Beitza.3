        "One may not trap fish from a vivarium on Yom Tov, and one may not put food before them, but one may trap an animal or fowl from a vivarium, and one may put food before them.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, not all vivariums are equal.  This is the general rule, all which need to be hunted (which requires effort) their trapping is assur, and all which does not need hunting, its trapping is mutar.", 
        "Trappings of animals, fowl, and fish which he prepared from erev Yom Tov, he may not take from the on Yom Tov, unless he knows that they were caught on erev Yom Tov.  And there was a story with one non-Jew who brought fish to Raban Gamliel and he said, they are allowed, it is just that I don’t want to take them.", 
        "An animal in danger of dying may not be slaughtered (on Yom Tov) unless there is enough time in the day to eat from it a kzayit roasted.  Rabi Akiva says, even a kzayit raw from the place of slaughter.  If he slaughtered it in a field, he may not bring it (from the field) with a staff or pole (which publicizes what he is doing), but he brings it in his hands part by part.", 
        "A bechor which fell into a pit, Rabi Yehuda says, an expert goes down and sees, if it has a blemish it will be brought up and slaughtered, and if not, it will not be slaughtered.  Rabi Shimon says, all which its blemish isn’t recognized that day, it is not considered prepared (to be slaughtered, for such is only done when the animal develops a blemish).", 
        "An animal that died, he may not move it from its place.  And once they asked Rabi Tarfon about it and about challa which became tame.  He entered the beit midrash and asked, and they told him, he may not be move them from their place.", 
        "One may not separate rights to an animal from the outset on Yom Tov, but they may separate rights to it from erev Yom Tov and slaughter and divide amongst themselves.  Rabi Yehuda says, one may weigh meat against a vessel or cleaver.  Chachamim say, on may not go to scales at all.", 
        "One may not sharpen a knife on Yom Tov, but one may pass it over its friend.  A person may not say to the butcher, weigh out for me a dinar of meat, but he slaughters and they separate it amongst themselves (the meat).", 
        "A person may say to his friend (a storekeeper), fill me this vessel, but not (tell) a size.  Rabi Yehuda says, if it was a vessel of a certain measurement, he may not fill it.  There was a story of Abba Shaul ben Batnit, who would fill his measures from erev Yom Tov and would give them to customers on Yom Tov.  Abba Shaul says, even on mo’ed he does like this, so the measures will be clear.  Chachamim say, even on a weekday he would do like that, because of the exactness of measures.  One may go before a shopkeeper with whom he is regular and say to him, give me eggs and nuts in their number, for this is the way of the homeowner to be counted in his house (so mentioning a number is not trading)."
