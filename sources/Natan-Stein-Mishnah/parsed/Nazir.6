        "Three types are assur to a nazir, tuma, shaving, and that which comes from the vine.  All that comes from the vine (juice, seeds, flesh, etc.) combines together, he isn’t chayav until he eats a kzayit from the grapes, and the first mishna (taught) until he drinks a revi’it of wine.  Rabi Akiva says, even if he soaked his bread in wine and there is enough in it to combine to a kzayit he’s chayav.", 
        "He is chayav on wine by itself (if he has a kzayit of only wine), on grapes by themselves, on chartzanim by themselves, and on zagim by themselves.  Rabi Elazar ben Azarya says, he isn’t chayav until he eats two chartzanim and their zagim.  Which are chartzanim and which are zagim?  The chartzanim are the external (skins) and the zagim are the internal (seeds) according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Yossi says, so that you don’t mistake (them), like the zug (bell) of the behema, the outer (skin) is a zug, and the inner (part of a bell)is an inbal.", 
        "Unspecified nezirut is thirty days.  If he shaved or bandits shaved him, it blocks thirty days (make them not count).  A nazir who shaved whether with scissors or a razor or plucked out anything, he’s chayav.  A nazir may rub or scratch (his hair), but he may not comb.  Rabi Yishma’el says, he may not rub with earth, because it  (causes) the hair (to) fall out.", 
        "A nazir who was drinking wine the whole day is only chayav one.  If they said to him, don’t drink, don’t drink, and he drinks, he is chayav on each one (warning).  If he was shaving the whole day, he is only chayav one.  If they said to him, don’t shave, don’t shave, and he shaves, he is chayav on each one.  If he was becoming tame for the dead all day, he is only chayav one.  If they said to him, do not become tame, do not become tame, and he became tame, he is chayav on each one.", 
        "Three types are assur to a nazir, tuma, shaving, and that which comes from the vine.  There is stringency by tuma and shaving from (compared to) what comes from the vine, for tuma and shaving block (make days already kept not count) and what comes from the vine does not block.  There is stringency by what comes from the vine from tuma and shaving, for what comes from the vine isn’t unbound from its general rule, and tuma and shaving are unbound from their general rules in shaving for a mitzva (if one got tzara’at he shaves after he is healed) and in a met mitzva (an abandoned corpse).  And there is a stringency of tuma over shaving, for tuma blocks all (of the time he has had as a nazir) and requires a korban, and shaving only blocks thirty days and one is not chayav a korban on it.", 
        "Tiglachat of tuma (a nazir must shave if he becomes tame), how?  He would sprinkle (waters of the red heifer) on the third and seventh (days of his uncleanliness), shaves on the seventh, and brings his korbanot on the eighth.  If he shaves on the eighth, he brings his korbanot that day, according to Rabi Akiva.  Rabi Tarfon said to him, what is the difference between this and a metzora (who would bring the korbanot on the ninth day if he shaved on the eighth)?  He said to him, this, his tahara is dependant on his days, and a metzora his tahara is dependant on his shaving, and he doesn’t bring a korban unless it was after sunset.", 
        "Tiglachat of tahara (a nazir shaves when he completes his period of nezirut), how?  He would bring three animals, a chatat, an olah, and a shlamim, and he slaughters the shlamim and (after) shaves for them (for the brining of korbanot), according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Eliezer says, he wouldn’t shave except for (after) the chatat, for the chatat always comes first.  And if he shaved for (any) one of the three, he’s yotze.", 
        "Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, if he brought three animals and didn’t specify (which animal was for which korban), that which is fir for a chatat will be brought as a chatat, (the one fit) for an olah will be brought as an olah, and for a shlamim will be brought as a shlamim.  He would take the hair of his head (he had grown as a) nazir, and through it under the pot (which the shlamim was being cooked in).  And if he shaved in the country (meaning outside the Beit Hamikdash), he would (bring) his hair (and throw it) under the pot.  What is this talking about?  By tiglachat of tahara, bit on tiglachat of tuma, he would not throw it under the pot.  Rabi Meir says, all throw under the pit, except for the tame who is only in the country.", 
        "If he was cooking the shlamim or over-boiling it, the kohen takes the cooked forearm from the ram, one loaf of matza from the basket (part of the shlamim), one wafer of matza, and puts on the hands of the nazir and waves them, and afterward the nazir is allowed to drink wine and become tame for the dead.  Rabi Shimon says, since on of the bloods was thrown on him he is allowed to drink wine and become tame for the dead.", 
        "If he shaved (based) on the zevach (offering) and it was found to be invalid, his tiglachat is invalid, and his zvachim do not count for him (for his time was blocked by his shaving).  If he shaved on a chatat which was not for its (the chatat’s) sake, and afterwards he brought the other korbanot for their sake, his tiglachat is invalid and his zvachim didn’t count.  If he shaved on the olah or shlamim which weren’t for their sakes, and afterwards brought his korbanot for their sakes, his tiglachat is invalid and his zvachim don’t count.  Rabi Shimon says, that zevach (offered for the wrong sake) does not count for him, but his other zvachim count for him.  And if he shaved on the three of them and one of them was found kosher, his shaving is kosher and he must bring the rest of the zvachim.", 
        "One who one of the bloods was thrown on him and he became tame, Rabi Eliezer says, it blocks everything.  Chachamim say, he brings the rest of the korbanot and becomes tahor.  They said to him, there was a case with Miriam Hatarmodit who one of the bloods was thrown on her, and they came and told her about her daughter who was in danger, and she went and found (her daughter) was dead, and the Chachamim said, she must bring the rest of her korbanot and become tahor."
