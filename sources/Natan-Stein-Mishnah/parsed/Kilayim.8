        "Kilayim in a vineyard may not be planted, maintained, or benefited from.  Kilayim by grain may not be planted or maintained, but may be eaten, and of course be benefited from.  Kilayim by clothes are allowed for all things except to wear.  Kilayim by animals may be raised and maintained, and it is only assur to breed them.  Kilayim by animals may not be paired with one another (for breeding or working).", 
        "A domesticated animal (behema) with a behema, a wild animal (chaya) with a chaya, behema with a chaya, chaya with a behema, non-kosher with non-kosher, kosher with kosher, non-kosher with kosher, and kosher with non-kosher may not plow together, pull together, or be harnessed together.", 
        "One who harnesses together receives lashes and one who sits on a (jointly pulled) wagon gets lashes.  Rabi Meir allows this.  And the third which is tied into the straps (and is of a different species than the other two) is forbidden.", 
        "A horse may not be tied beside or behind a wagon (drawn by oxen) and Libyan camels cannot be tied to camels.  Rabi Yehuda says, all animals born of a horse, even if their father is a donkey, may draw with one another.  And likewise with the offspring of a donkey, even though their father was a horse.  But, those who had a mother of a donkey are forbidden with those with a mother of a horse.", 
        "Mules with parents of unknown genders are forbidden (to be mixed in breeding or harnessing) but a mule with a horse mother may be.  Some man-like ape is considered a chaya.  Rabi Yossi says their corpses render a tent tame (unlike an animal).  The hedgehog and the bush weasel are chayot.  A bush weasel, Rabi Yossi says that Beit Shamay says it makes tame by carrying a kzayit or touching a lentil sized piece.", 
        "A wild ox is a behema.  Rabi Yossi says it is a chaya.  A dog is a chaya.  Rabi Meir says itâ€™s a behema.  A pig is a behema.  The wild donkey is a chaya.  The elephant and the monkey are chayot.  Man is allowed with all of them to pull, to plow, and to harness."
