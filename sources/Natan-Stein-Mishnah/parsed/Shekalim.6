        "Thirteen chests, thirteen tables, (and) thirteen (places for) prostrations were in the Beit Hamikdash.  People of the house of Raban Gamliel and of the house of Rabi Chanina sgan to the kohanim would bow fourteen times.  Where was the extra?  Opposite the wood pen, for they had a tradition in their hands from their forefathers that the ark was hidden there.", 
        "Once there was a kohen who was occupied (chopping wood) and he saw that the floor was different than the others.  He went and told his friend, and he didn’t manage to finish the thing (telling them) and his soul departed and it is known with certainty that the ark was hidden there.", 
        "And where would they bow?  Four in the north, four in the south, three in the east, and two in the west according to the thirteen gates.  The southern gates near the west (were) the upper gate, the fuel gate, the bechorot gate, and the water gate.  And why is it called the water gate?  Because there they would bring in the dish of water for the libation on Sukkot.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, because water trickles through it and in the future they will be under the threshold of the Beit Hamikdash.  Opposite them in the north near the west, the Yechonya gate, the korban gate, the women’s gate, and the song gate.  And why is it called the Yechonya gate?  For there Yechonya went out in hi exile.  In the east, the Nikanor gate, and it had two small gates, one on its right and one on its left, and the two in the west they didn’t have a name.", 
        "There were thirteen tables in the Beit Hamikdash, eight of marble in the slaughterhouse upon which they would rinse the viscera, and two to the west of the ramp, one of marble one of silver, on the marble they would put the limbs and on the silver they would put the service vessels.  Two in the hall on the inside near the entrance of the Beit Hamikdash, one of marble and on of gold, on the marble they would put the (new) showbreads on their way in (to the Beit Hamikdash) and on they gold (they would put the old showbreads) on their way out, for one goes up in holiness and does not go down.  And there was on of gold on the inside, and upon it there were always the showbreads.", 
        "There were thirteen chests in the Beit Hamikdash and it was written on them, (in Aramaic) new shekels, old shekels, nests, young birds for an olah, wood, frankincense, gold for the kaporet, and six for donations.  New shekels, (a chest) for each year, old (shekels), one who did not give for the previous year gives the next year.  Nests, they are turtledoves.  Young birds for olot, they are pigeons, and they are all olot according to Rabi Yehuda.  Chachamim say, nests, for both chatat and olah, and young birds for olot are all for olot.", 
        "One who says, wood is upon me (to donate) shall not (give) less than two logs.  Frankincense, shall not (give) less than a handful.  And six for donations.  Donations, what would they do with them?  They would buy olot with it and meat for its sake (to offer) and hides for the kohanim.  This interpretation was expounded by Yehoyada the kohen gadol, “it is an asham, for he is certainly guilty before Hashem.”  This is the general rule, anything which comes because of sin or guilt, it will be used to buy olot, the meat is for its sake and the hides are for the kohanim.  There were two psukim found to be meaningful, asham for Hashem and asham for the kohanim, and it says, “the money of the asham and the money of the chatat will not be brought to the Beit Hamikdash, they will be for the kohanim.”"
