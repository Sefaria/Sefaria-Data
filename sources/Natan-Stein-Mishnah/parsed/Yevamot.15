        "A woman who went overseas with her husband and there is peace between him and her and peace in the world, and she comes and says, my husband died, she’ll marry.  (If she says,) my husband died (and had no children) she gets yibum.  If there is peace between him and her but war in the world, or there is discord between him and her but peace in the world, and she comes and says, my husband died, she is not believed.  Rabi Yehuda says, she is never believed unless she comes crying and with torn clothing.  They said to him, either way she may marry.", 
        "Beit Hillel says, we did not hear (a ruling that we trust the woman) except when she comes from the harvest in that country (so it is verifiable) and it is like a case which happened (something plausible).  Beit Shamay said to them, whether she comes from the harvest, the olives, the grapes, or another country, the Chachamim did not speak of harvest, but rather a happening (which happened while he was out harvesting, but is not necessarily a direct consequence thereof).  Beit Hillel returned and taught like Beit Shamay.", 
        "Beit Shamay says, she may get married and takes her ktuba.  Beit Hillel says, she may marry but not take her ktuba.  Beit Shamay said to them, you allowed the strict (risk of an) inappropriate relationship, but you won’t allow the lenient money?  Beit Hillel said to them, we found that the brothers do not enter the inheritance (divide up her husband’s inheritance) based on her words.  Beit Shamay said to them, and don’t we learn from the scroll of her ktuba that he wrote for her, that if she marries another she takes what is written for her.  And Beit Hillel returned and taught like Beit Shamay.", 
        "All are believed to testify for her (that her husband died) except for her mother-in-law, her mother-in-law’s daughter, her rival, her sister in law, and the daughter of her husband.  What is the difference between get and death (for these may testify that he gave her a get)?  For the writing (the document) proves (that they are telling the truth.  One witness says, he died, and she married, and (then) one witness said, he didn’t die, behold she doesn’t exit.  One witness says, he died, and two witnesses said, she didn’t die, even though she married, she exits.  Two said, he died, and one says, he didn’t die, even if she didn’t marry, she may marry.", 
        "One woman said, he died, and one woman said, he didn’t die (and they were both married to him).  The one who said, he died marries and takes her ktuba, and the one who said, he didn’t die doesn’t marry and doesn’t take her ktuba.  One says, he died, and one said he was killed, Rabi Meir says, since they are denying each other, they do not marry.  Rabi Yehuda and Rabi Shimon say, since they agree that he is no longer alive, they may marry.  A witness says, he died, and a witness said, he didn’t die, a wife says he died, and a wife says, he didn’t die, behold she may not marry.", 
        "A woman who went with her husband overseas and came back and says, my husband died, she marries and takes her ktuba, and her rival is assur (to marry, for her testimony is not valid for her rival).  If she (the rival) was a bat yisra’el (married) to a kohen, she may eat truma according to Rabi Tarfon.  Rabi Akiva says, this is not a way to remove her from transgression until she is assur to marry and assur to eat truma.", 
        "She said, my husband died and then my father-in-law died, she marries and takes her ktuba, but her mother-in-law is assur (to marry).  If she was a bat yisra’el to a kohen, she may eat truma.  Rabi Akiva says, this is not a way to remove her from transgression until she is assur to marry and assur to eat truma.  He betrothed one of five women, he does not know which one he betrothed, and each one says, he betrothed me.  He gives a get to each and puts a ktuba between them (to split) and goes away, according to Rabi Tarfon.  Rabi Akiva says, this is not the way to remove her from transgression until he gives a get and a ktuba to each.  He stole from one of five, doesn’t know which one he stole from, and each one says, he stole from me.  He puts the stolen object between them and goes away, according to Rabi Tarfon.  Rabi Akiva says, this is not the way to remove him from transgression until he pays what he stole to each of them.", 
        "A woman who went with her husband overseas and her son with them, and she came and said, my husband died and then my son, she is believed (since she remained as she was when she left, having no need for yibum).  (If she says,) my son died and them my husband, she is not believed (because she made herself a need for yibum).  But they are suspicious of her words, and she does chalitza and not yibum.", 
        "(A woman went overseas with her husband, came back, and said,) it was given to me (I gave birth to) a son overseas, and she said, my son died and then my husband died, she is believed.  (She said,) my husband died and then my son died, she isn’t believed.  And they are suspicious of her words, and she does chalitza bit not yibum.", 
        "(A woman went overseas with her husband, came back, and said,) it was given to me a yavam (brother-in-law on the husband’s side) overseas, my husband died and then my yavam died, (or) my yavam (died) and then my husband, she is believed.  If she, her husband, and her yavam went overseas, and she said, my husband died and then my yavam, my yavam and then my husband, she is not believed, for a woman is not believed to say, my yavam died such that she will get married, and (we do) not (believe her when she says) my sister died such that she will enter into his(her sister’s husband’s) house.  And a man is not believed to say, my brother died, such that he will do yibum for his wife, and not (if he says), my wife died, such that he may marry her sister."
