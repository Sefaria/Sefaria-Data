        "Monetary matters are judged by three judges.  Theft and injury by three.  Property damage, a shor tam, kefel, and four or five times repayment by three.  Rape, seduction, and denial of spousal virginity by three, all according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say denial of spousal virginity is by twenty-three, because a life hangs in the balance.", 
        "Lashes by three.  Based on Rabi Yishma’el it was said twenty-three.  Declaring the month by three.  Declaring the year by three, according to Rabi Meir.  Raban Shimon Ben Gamliel says, you start with three, discuss with five, and finish declaring with seven, but if it was only three it’s valid.", 
        "Smicha by the Sanhedrin when they accidentally caused the tzibur to sin and egla arufa (which the sages read when they kill a calf in repentance for an unknown corpse found), by three according to Rabi Shimon.  Rabi Yehuda says by five.  Chalitza and refusal of non-paternal contracted marriage by three.  Redeeming the fruit of the fourth year of a tree and ma’aser sheni which has no set value by three.  Assessing the value of hekdesh by three.  Evaluating things by three, and Rabi Yehuda says one of them must be a kohen.  Evaluating lands and people, by nine and a kohen.", 
        "Capital cases by twenty-three.  Bestiality by twenty-three, because a pasuk has them killed.  An ox that will be stoned by twenty-three, because a pasuk says to kill the owner too.  A wolf, lion, bear, tiger, panther, or snake that killed a man by twenty-three  Rabi Eliezer says whoever kills them quickly gets merit.  Rabi Akiva says they (except a snake) die only by twenty-three.", 
        "These are judged by seventy-a full tribe, a false prophet, a kohen gadol, going to an optional war, adding to Yerushalayim or the Beit Mikdash, appointing a Sanhedrin (of twenty-three) for the tribes, and declaring a wayward city.  But, you can’t declare a wayward city on the border (it will be a break in the border), and you can’t make three, but you can make one or two far from each other.", 
        "A large Sanhedrin was of seventy-one, and a small one was of twenty-three.  The large gets its number from the zekenim plus Moshe, and the small from two times “edah” is twenty, which we see from ten spies being called edah.  The three come from a pasuk that says not to follow the many to bad, but then why achare rabim lahatot?  So, we can follow one to good, but two to bad, meaning two extra are needed to condemn (only a twelve-ten would condemn, and one of the edot is to condemn), but we can’t have an even number, so we have twenty-three.  How many people have to be in a city for there to be a Sanhedrin?  One hundred twenty.  Rabi Nechemia says two hundred thirty, according to sarei asarot."
