        "Produce from outside of Israel which was brought into Israel is chayav in challa.  They left here (Israel) to there, Rabi Eliezer says chayav and Rabi Akiva says patur.", 
        "Dirt from outside of Israel which came to Israel on a boat is chayav in trumot and ma’asrot.  Rabi Yehuda says, when?  When the ship beaches.  Dough which was kneaded with fruit juice is chayav in challa and may be eaten with unclean hands (juice doesn’t take on tuma).", 
        "A woman may sit and cut off challa while naked, because she can cover herself (by crossing her legs), but a man cannot.  One who can’t make his dough while tahor should make kav (sized doughs, not chayav challa) and not make it (a large dough) while tame.  Rabi Akiva says, let him make it while tame and not make it into kabim (he will do challa and simply burn it) and just as he designates while tahor, he will designate while tame, for this he will designate challa and for that he will designate challa, for there is no challa in kabim.", 
        "One who makes doughs of kabim and they touch each other, they are patur from challa until they stick together.  Rabi Eliezer says, even one who takes down (from the oven) and puts them in a basket, the basket combines them for challa.", 
        "One who takes his challa from flour, it’s not challa, and it’s stolen in the hand of a kohen.  The dough itself is chayav by challa.  And flour, if it has enough to be the full measurement, it’s chayav for challa and assur to zarim, according to Rabi Yehoshua.  They said to him, once an elder, who was a zar, took it (the challa flour).  He said to them, he ruined for himself (is punishable) but fixed for others (who will do such based on his example and be innocent).", 
        "Five rova of flour is chayav in challa.  They, their leaven, fine bran, and coarse bran are five rova, they’re chayav.  If the coarse bran was removed (and it wasn’t enough) but then added back, it’s patur.", 
        "The measure of challa is one in twenty-four.  One who makes dough for himself and one who makes dough for his son’s wedding, one in twenty-four.  A baker who makes to sell in the shuk, and so too a woman who made to sell in the shuk, one in forty-eight.  If her dough became tame by accident or for reasons beyond her control, it’s one in forty-eight.  If she intentionally made it tame, one in twenty-four, such that a sinner would not get a reward (from the sin).", 
        "Rabi Eliezer says, it may be taken from the tahor on the tame.  How?  A tahor dough and a tame dough, he takes enough for challa from the dough which hasn’t had challa taken, and puts less then a kzayit of dough between them (not enough to transfer tuma) in order that he should be taking from what is nearby, but the Chachamim prohibit this."
