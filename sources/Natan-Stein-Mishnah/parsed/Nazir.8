        "Two nezirim to whom one said, I saw one of you became tame, and I don’t know which of you it was, they shave and bring a korban tuma and a korban tahara, and say, if I am the tame, the korban tuma is mine and the korban tahara is yours, and if I am the tahor, the korban tahara is mine and the korban tuma is yours.  And they count thirty days and bring a korban tahara and say, if I am the tame, the korban tuma is mine, the korban tahara is yours, and this korban is my tahara, and if I am the tahor, the korban tahara is mine, the korban tuma is yours, and this is your tahara.  If one of them died, Rabi Yehoshua said, he asks one from the shuk (a random person) that she shall vow opposite him as a nazir and says, if I was tame, behold you are immediately a nazir (so you can use the korban we bring in thirty days), and if I was tahor, behold you are a nazir after thirty days (for I will use the korban we bring in thirty days).  They count thirty days and bring a korban of tuma and a korban of tahara and say, if I am the one who became tame, the korban of tuma is mine and the korban of tahara is yours, and if I am he who is tahor, the korban tahara is mine and the korban tuma is doubtful.  And they count thirty days and bring a korban tahara and say, if I am the tame, the korban tuma is mine, the korban tahara is yours, and this korban is my tahara, and if I am the tahor, the korban tahara is mine, the korban tuma is yours, and this is your tahara.  Ben Zoma said to him, and who would listen to him that she he vow opposite him to be a nazir?  Rather, he brings a chatat of the fowl and an olah of the animal and says, if I was tame, the chatat is obligatory and the olah is optional, and if I was tahor, the olah is obligatory and the chatat was is a doubt.  And they count thirty days, and he brings a korban of tahara and says, if I was tame, the first olah was optional and this one is obligatory, and if I was tahor, the first olah was obligatory and this one is one is optional, and this is the rest of my korban.  Rabi Yehoshua said, we find this one brings korbanot in halves (piecemeal).  But the Chachamim agreed with Ben Zoma.", 
        "A nazir who was doubtfully tame and doubtfully a metzora muchlat (declared nazir), he eats of the holies after sixty days, and drinks wine and becomes tame for the dead after one hundred and twenty days, for shaving for the nega (affliction, meaning tzara’at) pushes off the shaving of the nazir when it is certain, but when it is a doubt it does not push off (and to resolve all the possibilities, we must have the nezirim shave several times, hence the longer periods until the nezirim return to normal)."
