        "Money found between (the chest of) shkalim and (the chest of) donations what is close to shkalim falls in with shkalim, (close to) the donations for the donations, midway falls in with the donations.  Between the wood and the frankincense, close to the wood for wood, to the frankincense for frankincense, and midway for frankincense.  Between the nests and the young birds for an olah, close to the nests for nests, to the young birds for an olah for the young birds for an olah, and midway for the young birds for an olah.  Between chulin and ma’aser sheni, close to the chulin for chulin, to the ma’aser sheni for ma’aser sheni, and midway for ma’aser sheni.  This is the general rule, we go according to the closer to the lenient, and midway according strict.", 
        "Money found before the sellers or animals, is made into ma’aser.  If it’s on the temple mount, it’s chulin.  If in Yerushalayim during a holiday, it’s ma’aser.  On all other days of the year, it’s chulin.", 
        "Meat found in the sanctuary, limbs are olot, slices, chatat.  In Yerushalayim, shlamim.  In either case, it must lose its shape and go to be burned.  If it is found in the borders, limbs are nevelot (not allowed), slices are allowed.  And in the time of a holiday when meat is abundant even limbs are allowed.", 
        "An animal found from Yerushalayim to Migdal Ever and that distance in every direction, rams, are olot, ibex, shlamim.  Rabi Yehuda says, what is fit to be a pesach is psachim if it is (at most) thirty days before the holiday.", 
        "At first they used to take collateral from the finder until he would bring its libations.  When they started to let it down and flee, the court established that its libations would be from the public (funds).", 
        "Rabi Shimon said, the court established seven things, and this is one of them.  A non-Jew who sent olot from the island nations and sent their libations with them, they offer from his and if not (he didn’t send) they offer from the public.  And so too with a convert who died and set aside offerings, if he has libations, they bring from his and if not, from the public.  And it was a condition of the court on a kohen gadol who died that his mincha (which he normally brought every day of his own money) would be brought from the public.  Rabi Yehuda says, fro his heirs.  And it was offered whole.", 
        "On salt and wood that the kohanim would enjoy of them, on the (red) cow that one could not commit misappropriation with its ashes, and on invalid nests that they should come from the public.  Rabi Yossi says, one who supplies the bird offerings supplies (replacements) for the invalid ones."
