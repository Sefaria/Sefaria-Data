        "A garment that was dies with the peels of orla must be burnt.  If it was mixed with others, they must all be burnt, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, it is nullified by one in two hundred.", 
        "One who dyes (thread) the length of a sit (a measurement) with orla peels and he wove it into a garment, and it’s not know which it is, Rabi Meir says, the garment is burnt.  Chachamim say, it is nullified by one in two hundred.", 
        "One who weaves the length of a sit of wool from a firstborn in a garment, the garment must be burnt.  And from the hair of a nazir or the first born of a donkey (either of which) made into a sack, the sack must be burnt.  And with holy things, it makes the whole thing holy.", 
        "A dish which one cooked with peels of orla must be burnt.  If it mixed with other (food) it is nullified by one in two hundred.", 
        "An oven which one heated with orla peels, and he baked in it bread, the bread must be burn.  If it was mixed with others, it is nullified by one in two hundred.", 
        "One who had bundles of fenugreek of vineyard kilayim, they must be burnt.  If they mixed in others, they must all be burnt according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, they are nullified by one in two hundred.", 
        "For Rabi Meir used to say, whatever is customary to count (while selling), makes holy (causes everything to be burnt, for things sold individually always have a significant value).  Chachamim say, only six things (are important enough to) make anything holy.  Rabi Akiva says, seven.  And these are they, perech nuts, Badan pomegranates, sealed barrels (of wine), spinach shoots, heads of cabbage, and Greek gourd.  Rabi Akiva says, even loaves of a homeowner (superior to bakers’).  Whichever of these is liable to orla, is (makes the mixture) orla, and (whatever) is vineyard kilayim (the mixture) is vineyard kilayim.", 
        "How (do the things in the previous mishna sanctify in any quality)?  (If whole, but) if the nuts split, the pomegranates burst open, the barrels opened,  the gourds were cut, or the loaves were sliced, they are nullified by one in two hundred.", 
        "Something which we’re not sure if it’s orla, in Israel is assur, is Syria is mutar, and outside of Israel, he may go and buy, as long as he doesn’t see the person gather (the orla fruit).  A vineyard planted with vegetables, and the vegetables are sold outside of it, in Israel it is assur, in Syria it’s mutar, and outside of Israel he may go and buy it, as long as he doesn’t gather it in his (own) hand.  New cereals (before omer) is assur from the torah everywhere, orla (outside of Israel) is by halacha (to Moshe at Sinai), and kilayim is by Rabbinic law."
