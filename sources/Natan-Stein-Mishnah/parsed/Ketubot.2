        "A woman who became a widow or divorced she says, I married as a virgin (though she does not have the ktuba to prove it), and he (the husband who divorced her) says, not so, I married you as a widow.  If there are witnesses that she went out with a hinuma (a type of veil) and with an uncovered head (a certain hairdo, both of which are characteristics of virgins getting married) her ktuba is two hundred.  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka says, even if they handed out parched grain (a custom in his community at the wedding of a virgin).", 
        "And Rabi Yehoshua admits (to Raban Gamliel, despite rulings in cases in the previous perek) by one who says to his friend, this field was your father’s and I bought it from him, that he is believed for the mouth that made it assur (by saying it was originally his father’s) was the mouth that made it mutar (by saying I bought it, if he were lying, he could have made a better lie).  And if there are witnesses that it is his (the other man’s) father’s, and (then) he says, I bought it from him, he is not believed.", 
        "Witnesses (called to testify about a document they signed) who said, this is our handwriting, but we were forced, we were minors we were pasul, behold they are believed.  And if there are witnesses that it is their handwriting, or they handwriting came out (was verified) from another place, they are not believed.", 
        "One says, this is my handwriting and this is my friend’s handwriting and one says, this is my handwriting and this is my friend’s handwriting, they are believed.  One says, this is my handwriting and one says, this is my handwriting, another needs to combine with them according to Rabi.  Chachamim say, they do not need another to combine with them, rather one is believed to say, this is my handwriting.", 
        "A woman who said, I was the wife of a man and I am divorced, she is believed, for the mouth with made assur is the mouth which made patur.  And if there are witnesses that she was the wife of a man, and she says, I am divorced, we do not believe her.  If she said, I was taken captive and I am pure (was not raped in captivity), she is believed.  If there are witnesses that she was taken captive and she says, I am pure, she is not believed.  And if after she married the witnesses come, behold she does not exit.", 
        "Two women who were taken captive, one says, I was taken captive and am pure, and one says, I was taken captive and a pure, they are not believed (for each woman is also in effect testifying that the other was taken captive).  When they testify about each other, behold they are believed.", 
        "And so too two men, one says, I am a kohen, and one says, I am a kohen, they are not believed (for they testify only about themselves, so there is only one witness).  When they testify about each other, they are believed.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda says, they do not elevate to kehuna based on one (witness).  Rabi Elazar said, when?  In a place where there are objectors (to his kehuna we need two witnesses), but in a place where there are no objectors, we raise hit to kehuna based on one witness.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says in the name of Rabi Shimon the son of the sgan, we raise to kehuna based on one witness.", 
        "A woman who was imprisoned by non-Jews, if (she was imprisoned) because of money, she is mutar to her husband, for capital (cases), she is assur to her husband (for she might sleep with someone who promises to save her).  A city conquered by siege, any kohenet who was in it (the city) is pasul.  And if they have witnesses (that she was not raped), even a slave, even a maidservant, behold these are believed.  And a person is not believed about himself.  Rabi Zecharia the son of the butcher says, (if a man swears) by the Beit Hamikdash, her (my wife’s) hand did not move from my hand from when the non-Jews entered Yerushalayim until they left.  They said to him, a person does not testify about himself.", 
        "And these are believed to testify when they are adults about something they saw while minors.  A person is trusted to sat, this is my father’s handwriting, this is the handwriting of my Rabbi, this is the handwriting of my brother, I remember when so-and-so went out with a hinuma and her head bare (signs she was a virgin when married), so-and-so left the house of learning to immerse (in order) to eat truma (and therefore is a kohen), he would take a share (of truma) with us from the threshing floor, this place is a Beit Hapras (a tame area where a grave was ploughed over), and up until here we would come on Shabbat.  But a person is not believed to say, so-and-so had a path (through another’s field) here, or so-and-so had a ma’amad and a misped (standing and bemoaning, two parts of a funeral procession) here."
