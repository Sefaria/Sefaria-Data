        "Shvi’it does shmitta (cancellation of loans) for a loan whether or not there is a written agreement.  Credit from a shop isn’t cancelled, but if it was made into a loan, it is cancelled.  Rabi Yehuda says, the first (converts and is) cancelled.  A worker’s wages aren’t cancelled, but if he converted it to a loan, it is cancelled.  Rabi Yossi says, (wages for) any work that must stop on shvi’it are cancelled, and for work which doesn’t stop on shvi’it aren’t cancelled.", 
        "One who shechted a cow and distributed it (among various buyers) on Rosh Hashana, if the new month was declared, it’s cancelled, if not (they calculated for the purpose of making Rosh Hashana) it’s not cancelled.  One who rapes, seduces, or denies spousal virginity, or any act of the court, isn’t cancelled.  One who lends with collateral or gives over his loans to beit din it’s not cancelled.", 
        "A prozbul isn’t cancelled.  This is one of the things Hillel Hazaken instituted.  When he saw that people refrained from giving loans to each other, and were transgressing on what is written in the torah, “guard yourself, lest there be a thing with your heart which is base etc.” Hillel Hazaken instituted prozbul.", 
        "This is the body of a prozbul, I give over to you, person so-and-so the judges in such-and-such a place, that anything which is owed to me I may collect whenever I wish, and the judges sign below, or the witnesses (sign).", 
        "A predated prozbul is valid, but a postdated one is invalid.  Predated documents of debt are invalid, but postdated ones are valid.  One who borrows from five writes a prozbul for each.  If five borrow from one, he only need write one prozbul for all.", 
        "A prozbul is only written on land.  If the debtor has no land, the lender gives him a tiny piece of land and writes on that.  If he has land in the city that is already collateral, he may write a prozbul on it.  Rabi Chutzpit says, one may write for a man on his wife’s property, and for orphans on the property of his guardians.", 
        "A beehive, Rabi Eliezer says, it is like land, you may write a prozbul on it, it doesn’t take on tuma when it’s in its place, and one who takes (honey) from it on Shabbat is chayav.  Chachamim say, it isn’t land, one cannot write a prozbul on it, it gets tuma even in its place, and one who takes from it on Shabbat is patur.", 
        "One who repays a debt in shvi’it, the lender must say, it is forgiven.  If the debtor says, even so, he may take the money, as it says, “and this is the word of shmitta.”  Similarly, a murderer who was exiled to an ir miklat and the residents of the city want to honor him, he must say, I am a murderer.  If they say, even so, he may accept, for it says, “and this is the word of the murderer.”", 
        "One who repays debt during shvi’it, the Chachamim are pleased with them.  One who borrows from a convert whose sons converted with him need not pay back the sons, but if he did, the Chachamim are pleased with him.  All things are acquired by way of pulling, and whoever keeps his word (to keep a deal where the bought item hasn’t been acquired yet) the Chachamim are pleased with him."
