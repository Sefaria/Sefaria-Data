        "The way of chalitza is with three judges, even if the three of them are lay people.  If she did chalitza on his (leather) shoe (which is done by loosening the shoe) if on a cloth shoe, her chalitza is pasul.  A sandal with a leather backing, it’s kosher, if it doesn’t have a leather backing it’s pasul.  (If the straps on the sandal were all) below the knee, her chalitza is kosher, if above the knee her chalitza is pasul.", 
        "If she did chalitza on a sandal which isn’t his, or a wooden sandal, or the left sandal on the right (foot) her chalitza is valid.  If she did chalitza on a (shoe which is too) big which he can walk with or a small (shoe) which covers most of his foot, her chalitza is valid.  If she did chalitza at night, her chalitza is valid, and Rabi Eliezer makes it pasul.  On the left (foot) her chalitza is pasul, and Rabi Eliezer makes it valid.", 
        "If she loosened and spat (she must spit before him) but didn’t declare (certain psukim) her chalitza is valid.  If she declared and spat but didn’t loosen her chalitza is pasul.  If she loosened and declared but didn’t spit, Rabi Eliezer says her chalitza is pasul.  Rabi Akiva says, her chalitza is valid.  Rabi Eliezer says, “like this it shall be done,” every thing which is an act hinders (the proper performance).  Rabi Akiva said to him, from there you bring a proof?  “Like this it shall be done to the man,” anything which is done to the man (loosening, but spitting is not done to him).", 
        "A deaf-dumb (man) who got chalitza or a deaf-dumb (woman) who did chalitza, and one who does chalitza to a minor, her chalitza is pasul.  A minor who did chalitza should do chalitza when she grows up, and if she didn’t do chalitza, her chalitza is pasul (and she must do it again).", 
        "If she did chalitza before two or three (people as a court) and one of them was found to be a relative or pasul, her chalitza is pasul.  Rabi Shimon and Rabi Yochanan the sandalmaker validate.  And once one did chalitza between him and her (with no court) in prison and the matter came before Rabbi Akiva and he validated it.", 
        "The way of chalitza, he and his yevama come to the court and they give advice logical for him as it says, “and the elders of the town call to him and speak to him.” And she says, “my yavam refuses to establish for his brother a name in Yisra’el, he did not agree to do yibum for me.”  And he says, “I didn’t want to take her.”  And they would say it in the holy words (the original text).  “And he yevama came before him in sight of the elders and she loosened his shoe from on his foot and spat before him,” the spit is seen to the judges.  “And she will answer and say, like this will be done to a man who will not build the house of his brother.”  They would read until there.  And when Rabi Hurkanos rehearsed under the terebinth (a tree) in Kfar Etam and finished the whole section, the adopted to finish the whole section.  “And his name will be called in Yisra’el the house of the loosened shoe,” it is the way for the judges (to call this out) but not for the students.  Rabi Yehuda says, it is the way for all of those who are standing there to say, the shoe is loosened, the shoe is loosened, the shoe is loosened."
