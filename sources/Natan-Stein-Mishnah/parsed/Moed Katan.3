        "And these may shave on Chol Hamo’ed, one who comes from overseas (and could not shave before the festival), from captivity, from prison, from excommunication and the Chachamim released, and so too one who was examined for excommunication and was released, a nazir (whose vow ended on Chol Hamo’ed), and a metzora coming up from his tuma to his tahara.", 
        "And these may do laundry on Chol Hamo’ed, one who comes from overseas, from captivity, from prison, from excommunication and the Chachamim released, and so too one who was examined for excommunication and was released, hand towels, barber’s wraps, bath towels, zavin, zavot, niddot, women who just gave birth, and all who go up from tuma to tahara, behold these are mutar, and all other people are assur.", 
        "And these may be written on Chol Hamo’ed, marriages for women, divorce documents, receipts, wills (for a person who is dying), gifts, pruzbolin (which prevent loans from being forgiven in shvi’it), assessments, documents of sustenance (to give sold property to family), bills of chalitza (refusal of a levirate marriage), refusals (of pre-arranged marriages by orphaned girls), arbitration documents, court decrees, and letters of authority.", 
        "One does not write promissory notes on Chol Hamo’ed, and if he doesn’t believe (the borrower without a document) or if he (the scribe) has nothing to eat (and needs the wages), for this he may write.  One may not write books, tfillin, or mezuzot on Chol Hamo’ed, and they may not correct (even) one letter, even if it is the torah of sanctuary.  Rabi Yehuda says, one may write tfillin and mezuzot for himself, and he may spin on his thigh (a different way than normal) tchelet for tzitzit.", 
        "One who buries his dead three days before the festival, the decree of seven (days of mourning) is cancelled for him.  If eight, the decree of thirty days (of lesser mourning) are cancelled for him, for they said, Shabbat is counted (in the days) and does not stop (the days), festivals interrupt and are not counted.", 
        "Rabi Eliezer says, since the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed, Shavuot is like Shabbat (with regard to mourning).  Raban Gamliel says, Rosh Hashana and Yom Hakippurim are like festivals.  Chachamim say, not like this one and not like this one, rather Shavuot is like a festival and Rosh Hashana and Yom Hakippurim are like Shabbat.", 
        "One does not tear (clothing, as a sign of mourning), lay bare (the shoulder), or have the meal for the mourner, except those who bury the dead (immediate relatives), and they have the meal for the mourner only on an upright couch (for lowering the couch as a sign of mourning is not done on Chol Hamo’ed).  And they do not bring (the meal) to the house of the mourner a tavla (an ornate plate), an iskulta (a silver or glass bowl) or a kanon (a special basket), only in baskets.", 
        "One does not set down the coffin in the street (on Chol Hamo’ed) so as not to make eulogy regular, and never (do they set down the coffin) of women out of respect.  Women on Chol Hamo’ed may wail, but they may not beat (hands).  Rabi Yishma’el says, those next to the coffin may beat.", 
        "On Rosh Chodesh, Chanuka, and Purim they wail and beat, and on this (chol Hamo’ed) and that (list) they may not lament.  (After) the dead is buried, they do not wail or beat.  What is wailing?  When all wail together (a dirge).  Lamenting?  When one speaks and all the others answer after her, as it says, “and teach your daughters wailing, and all of them their neighbor lamentation.”  But for the future is says, “death will be swallowed up forever, and Hashem wipe tears from all faces etc.”"
