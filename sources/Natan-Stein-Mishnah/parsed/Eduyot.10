        "One may not stand an animal at an inn of non-Jews because they are suspected about bestiality.  And a woman may not be alone with them (non-Jews) because they are suspected about inappropriate relations.  And a man may not be alone with them, because they are suspected about murder.  A bat yisra’el may not deliver (be a midwife) for a non-Jewess, for she is delivering a child for avoda zara, but a non-Jewess may deliver for a bat yisra’el.  A bat yisra’el may not wean the child of a non-Jewess, but a non-Jewess may wean the child of a yisra’elit with her permission.", 
        "One may be healed by them (non-Jews) a healing of money (non life-threatening illness), but not a healing of souls (life-threatening illness).  And one may not get a haircut from them anywhere (even in public, for he might slit the Jew’s throat) according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, in a public domain it is allowed, but not when it is between him and him (when they are alone).", 
        "These things of non-Jews are forbidden, and their prohibition is a prohibition against (deriving any) benefit (from them) wine, the vinegar of non-Jews which started as wine, Hadriani earthenware (made with wine so that they can be soaked to release the wine), and skins (leather) of the (area of) the heart (for avoda zara they would take out the heart from the animal while killing it).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, where its tear is round (meaning the heart was removed) is it assur, but pulled (a long cut, meaning that is simply where they flayed it) it’s mutar.  Meat brought into (a place of) avoda zara (and taken out by a Jew) is mutar, but what is brought out (by a non-Jew) is assur, because it is like the sacrifices of the dead (which are assur), according to Rabi Akiva.  Those who are going to a place of avoda zara, it is assur to buy and sell with them, but those who are coming (back from the place) are mutar (to do business with).", 
        "The skins (for carrying liquids) of non-Jews and their jars with the wine of a Jew contained in it are assur, and their issur is a prohibition of (against) benefit, according to Rabi Meir.  The Chachamim say, their issur is not a prohibition of benefit.  The grape skins and grape seeds of non-Jews are assur, and their issur is a prohibition of benefit, according to Rabi Meir.  The Chachamim say, moist ones are assur, but dry ones are mutar.  Fish brine and Beit Unyaki (a place with a lot of avoda zara) cheeses of non-Jews are assur, and their issur is a prohibition of benefit, according to Rabi Meir.  The Chachamim say, their issur is not a prohibition of benefit.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda said, Rabi Yishma’el asked Rabi Yehoshua (a question when) they were walking on their way, he said to him, because of what are the cheeses of non-Jews assur?  He said to him, because they stand it (curdle it) with the rennet of a nevela (animal which died naturally).  He said to him, and isn’t (use of) the rennet of an olah (which is completely burnt), and they said, a kohen whose knowledge is good (who can stand it) may consume (milk) from it (the stomach of an olah) raw (before it is burnt).  And they did not admit to him (that a kohen can drink from the stomach of an olah raw), and they said, one does not benefit (from the olah) but there is no me’ila (if he does we do not consider it misappropriation of holy property).  He (Rabi Yehoshua) returned and said to him, because they let it stand in the rennet of calves of avoda zara.  He said to him, if so, why did they not prohibit benefit (gotten from the cheese)?  He (Rabi Yehoshua) brought him to a different subject, he said to him, Yishma’el my son, how do you read (the pasuk), “for your love (in the masculine) is better than wine?” or, “for your love (in the feminine) is better?”  He said to him, “for your love (in the feminine) is better.”  He said to him, the thing is not so, for behold his friend (the next pasuk) teaches about it, “for the smell of your (in the masculine) oils is good.”", 
        "These things of non-Jews are assur, but their issur is not a prohibition of (against) benefit, milk which a non-Jew milked and a Jew was not watching him, bread, oil, though Rabi and his court allowed oil, cooked dishes, pickled foods which it is the way to put in wine and vinegar, chopped tarit (a type of prepared fish), fish brine which does not have kilbit fish swimming in it (for that fish would grow only with kosher fishes), bits of asafetida (a spicy plant which would be finely chopped to use as a spice), or lumpy salt (which was used by bakers and could be made with lard mixed in).  Behold, these are assur, but their issur is not a prohibition of benefit.", 
        "These are mutar by eating, milk which a non-Jew milked with a Jew watching, honey, clusters of grapes, even if they are dripping and they do not have (a problem of) validity of drinks (though wine can become tame, if they drip on something, it does not make the object able to become tame), pickled things which their way is not to put in wine and vinegar, tarit which is not chopped, fish brine which has fish in it (so you can be sure that it was only kosher fish), the leaf of asafetida, and olives in round loaves (brines in round containers).  Rabi Yossi says, very soft olives are assur.  Locusts which come from a basket are assur, but from the storeroom (where they are sealed in barrels), they are mutar, and so too with truma (we fear one selling in baskets may mix in truma, but not into the sealed barrels)."
