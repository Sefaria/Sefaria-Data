        "Truma and trumat ma’aser of dmai, challa, and bikurim are nullified by one in a hundred, mix with one another, and must be taken off (an equivalent value of the mixture to the kohen).  Orla and vineyard kilayim are nullified by one in two hundred, combine, and does not need to be taken off.  Rabi Shimon says, they do not combine.  Rabi Eliezer says, they combine if it imparts flavor (as in with liquid products), but not to make assur.", 
        "Truma nullifies orla and orla to truma.  How?  A se’ah of truma which fell into a hundred (se’ah), and then three kabim of orla fell in, of three kabim of vineyard kilayim, this is hoe truma nullifies orla and orla to truma.", 
        "Oral nullifies kilayim, kilayim to orla, and orla to orla.  How?  A se’ah of orla which fell into two hundred, and afterwards a se’ah plus of orla fell in, or a se’ah plus of vineyard kilayim, this is how orla nullifies kilayim, kilayim to orla, and orla to orla.", 
        "Anything which causes fermentation, seasons, or makes meduma with truma, orla, or vineyard kilayim is assur (if mixed in).  Beit Shamay says, it even makes tame.  Beit Hillel says, nothing ever makes tame unless it is a kbeitza.", 
        "Dostai, a person from Kfar Yitma, was of the students of Beit Shamay and said, I heard from Shamay the elder, for he said, nothing ever makes tame unless it is a kbeitza.", 
        "And for what did they say, anything which causes to ferment, spices, or makes meduma is stringent?  For a kind with its own kind.  (For what did they say it) is stringent and lax?  A kind with not its own kind.  How?  Leaven of wheat which fell into a wheat dough, if it has enough to leaven, whether it is outweighed by one hundred to one or not, it’s assur.  If it doesn’t have enough to be outweighed a hundred to one, whether there’s enough to ferment or not, it’s assur.", 
        "(The previous mishna taught) to be stringent and lax by a kind in another kind, how (do we do this)?  Like crushed beans (truma) cooked with lentils (chulin) and there is enough to impart flavor, whether there is enough to nullify by one in a hundred or not, it’s assur.  If it doesn’t have enough to impart flavor, whether there is enough to nullify by one in a hundred or not, it’s mutar.", 
        "Chulin leaven which fell into dough, and there is enough to ferment, and then truma leaven fell in, or leaven of vineyard kilayim and there is enough to ferment, it’s assur (even though the leavening may have been caused by only the chulin).", 
        "Chulin leaven which fell into dough and leavened it, and then truma leaven fell in, or leaven of vineyard kilayim and there is enough to ferment it’s assur even though we know it was only the chulin leaven).  Rabi Shimon allows it.", 
        "Spices, two or three categories (of issur, i.e. truma, orla, etc.) of one species or of three, is assur, and they combine.  Rabi Shimon says, two or three categories of one species or two species of one category don’t combine.", 
        "Chulin leaven and truma leaven which fell into a dough, and neither has enough to ferment, but the combined and fermented, Rabi Eliezer says, I go by the last one (to fall in).  Chachamim say, whether the assur one fell first or last, it never prohi8bits unless there’s enough to ferment.", 
        "Yoezer of the Birah was one of the students of Beit Shamay and he said, I asked Raban Gamliel the elder who was standing in the east gate, and he said, it never prohibits until there is enough for it to ferment.", 
        "Vessels which one oiled with tame oil, and he returned and oiled with tahor oil, or vice versa, Rabi Eliezer says, I go according to the first one.  Chachamim say, according to the last one.", 
        "Leaven of truma of vineyard kilayim which fell into dough, and there isn’t enough in either to ferment, but they combined and fermented, it’s assur to zarim and mutar for kohanim.  Rabi Shimon allows for both zarim and kohanim.", 
        "Spices of truma or vineyard kilayim which fell into a pot, and neither one is enough to spice it, but the combined and spiced it, it’s assur to zarim and allowed to kohanim.  Rabi Shimon allows for both zarim and kohanim.", 
        "A piece of the most holy (chatat or asham), pigul, or notar which cooked with other pieces is assur to zarim and mutar to kohanim.  Rabi Shimon allows for both zarim and kohanim.", 
        "The most holy meat or holy meat which mixed up with ordinary meat is assur to the tame and mutar to the tahor."
