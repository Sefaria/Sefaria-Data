        "These arte knots which one is chayav for, the camel’s knot and the sailor’s knot.  And just as one is chayav for tying them, one is chayav for untying them.  Rabi Meir says, all knots which one can untie with one hand, one isn’t chayav for.", 
        "There are knots which one is not chayav for like the camel knot and sailor knot.  A woman may tie the opening of her robe, the cords of her hairnet, her belt, the straps of a shoe or sandal, flasks of wine or oil, and on a pot of meat (to seal in the heat).  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, one may tie before an animal so it doesn’t escape.  One may tie a bucket, but with a belt not a rope, and Rabi Yehuda allows it.  Rabi Yehuda said a general rule, any knot which isn’t meant to last, one isn’t chayav on it.", 
        "One may fold vessels (clothing) even four or five times (if it is to preserve them for later on Shabbat), and one may arrange the beds on Shabbat evening (Friday night) for Shabbat (Saturday), but not on Shabbat for motzei Shabbat.  Rabi Yishma’el says, one may fold clothing and arrange beds on Yom Kippur (which falls out on Friday) for Shabbat, and the chelev from Shabbat may be offered on Yom Kippur (which falls out on Saturday night).  Rabi Akiva says, those of Shabbat are not offered on Yom Kippur, and those of Yom Kippur are not offered on Shabbat."
