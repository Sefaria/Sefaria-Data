        "Until when may one plow in an orchard before shmitta?  Beit Shamay says, as long as the fruits will actually benefit (the fruits of the sixth year).  Beit Hillel says, until Shavuot, and their words are very similar.", 
        "What makes an orchard?  Any three trees in a beit se’ah.  If they can yield a cake of pressed figs of a certain weight, you may plow the entire area for it benefits the trees.  If they don’t yield that much you may only plow the area around each tree taken up by the worker and the basket outside of him.", 
        "Whether a sarak or fruit tree, you see them as if they bear figs, if they make the required amount, you can plow the whole area, for it’s for their need.  And if not, you may only plow what they need.", 
        "If one tree makes enough, but two don’t, or two make and one doesn’t, you may only plow what they need until they are between three and nine.  If there are ten and up, whether or not they make enough you may plow the whole beit se’ah for their need, as it says, “in plowing and harvesting you shall rest,” it didn’t need to say the plowing and harvesting of shmitta, rather plowing of erev shvi’it when shmitta is entering and harvesting of shmitta when it is going out to motzei shvi’it.  Rabi Yishma’el says, just as it is optional plowing, so too it is optional harvesting, which excludes harvesting for omer.", 
        "Three trees which belong to three people, these combine, and you plow the entire beit se’ah for them.  How much must be left between them?  Raban Gamliel says, enough for an ox can pass with the plowing tools.", 
        "Ten saplings spread about a beit se’ah, one may plow the entire space for them up until Rosh Hashana (so they won’t dry up).  If they were planted in a row and surrounded by a fence you may only plow what they need.", 
        "Saplings and gourds combine in a beit se’ah.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, if there are ten gourds in a beit se’ah, one may plow it all until Rosh Hashana.", 
        "Until when are they considered saplings? Rabi Elazar ben Azariah says, until they become permitted (from orla).  Rabi Yehoshua says until seven years.  Rabi Akiva says as long as they are called saplings.  A tree that was cut down and produced new roots less than a tefach, it’s a sapling, but if more than a tefach, it’s a tree, according to Rabi Shimon."
