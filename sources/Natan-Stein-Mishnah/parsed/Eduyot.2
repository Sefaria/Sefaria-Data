        "Rabi Chanina a sgan of the kohanim testified about four things, in all their days the kohanim never hesitated from burning meat which became tame from a contaminated object with meat which became tame from a source of tuma, even though they are adding tuma on tuma.  Rabi Akiva added, in all their days the kohanim they didn’t hesitate from burning the oil which became invalid from a person who immersed that day with candles which became tame with the tuma of a corpse, even though they were adding tuma on tuma.", 
        "Rabi Chanina a sgan of the kohanim said, in all my days, I never saw a hid going out to the place of burning.  Rabi Akiva said, from his words we learned that one who flays a bechor and finds it to be tref (internally torn) that the kohanim would derive benefit from the hide.  And the Chachamim say, (saying) I didn’t see isn’t a proof, rather it does go out to the place of burning.", 
        "He also testified about a small village which was near Yerushalayim and there was one elder there he would lend to all the people of the village and would write in his handwriting and others would sign, and the story came before the Chachamim and they allowed it.  According to their ways you can learn that a woman can write her own get, and a man may write his own receipt (proving he has paid the ktuba), for the enactment of the get is only with its signing.  And (he testified) on a needle found in the meat, for the knife and the hands are tahor and the meat is tame, but if it is found in the excrement (of the animal), all is tahor.", 
        "Three things Rabi Yishma’el said before the Chachamim in Kerem Beyavne, about a beaten egg that is put on truma vegetables, is it a connection (for becoming tame, so even in a situation where the egg could not become tame, the vegetables could), but if it was like a hat (the egg puffed and there was space between it and the vegetables) it is not a connection.  And about a stalk which was in the harvest (but was missed by the harvesters) and its head reaches the standing crop (when bent) it belongs to the homeowner, and if not, behold it is of the poor; and about a small garden which is surrounded by a row of trellised vines, if it has enough (space) for a harvester and his basket on this side, and enough for a harvester and his basket on that side, it may be planted, and if not, it may not be planted.", 
        "Three things were said before Rabi Yishma’el and he didn’t say either an issur or a heter, and Rabi Yehoshua ben Mattia expounded them.  One who opened a pussy wound on Shabbat, if it is to make the opening, he’s chayav, and if to get out the pus, he’s patur.  And on one who traps a snake on Shabbat, if he is dealing that it shouldn’t bite him, he’s patur, but if for medicine, he’s chayav.  And on (the status of accepting tuma of unopened) Ironion pots (made as a clay ball and then, once dry, the top is removed), that they are tahor in a tent (the same roof) with a dead body, and tame if carried by a zav.  Rabi Eliezer ben Tzadok says, even when carried by a zav they are tahor, for their work has not been finished.", 
        "Rabi Yishma’el said three things and Rabi Akiva did not agree with him, that garlic, unripe grapes, and unripe wheat which he crushed that day (erev Shabbat, for the juices) for Rabi Yishma’el says he may (have the juice) if it finished from when it gets dark (even if the juice still flows out on Shabbat) and Rabi Akiva says, he may not finish it.", 
        "Three things they said before Rabi Akiva, two in the name of Rabi Eliezer, and one in the name of Rabi Yehoshua.  The two in the name of Rabi Eliezer, that a woman may go out (on Shabbat) with a ‘city of gold’ (a brooch which is carved like Yerushalayim) and that pigeon racers are invalid for testimony.  And the one in the name of Rabi Yehoshua, if a sheretz (impure animal) is in the mouth of a rat and it walks on loaves of truma, it’s a doubt whether it touched or didn’t touch, the doubt is tahor.", 
        "Rabi Akiva said three, things, on two they agreed with him, and on one they didn’t agree with him.  On a limeworker’s sandal (used while working with the lime) that it accepts midras tuma.  And on the remnants of an oven four (tfachim are needed to be considered a large enough piece of the oven to accept tuma), for they would say three, and they agreed with him (on both).  And the one that they didn’t agree with him, on a chair (the seat of which was made from three slats) which two of its coverings (slats) were removed, one next to the other, that Rabi Akiva (allows to) make tame, and the Chachamim make tahor.", 
        "He used to say, the father merits for the son beauty, strength, wealth, wisdom, (length of) years, and the number of generations before him, and he is the end (this phrase is of unclear meaning), as it says, “(He) called the generations already.”  Even though it says, “and they will work them and make them suffer four hundred years,” and it says, “and the fourth generation will return here,” (showing that forefathers’ merits were not necessarily enough to prevent slavery).", 
        "He also used to say five things were (the length of) twelve months, the judgment of the generation of the flood was twelve months, the judgment of Iyov was twelve months, the judgment of the Egyptians (the plagues) was twelve months, the judgment of Gog and Magog will come and be twelve months, and the judgment of the wicked in Hell is twelve months, as it says, “and it will be from a new moon to the (same) new moon.”  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri says, from Pesach to Shavuot, as it says, “from one Shabbat to another (a reference to Shavuot).”"
