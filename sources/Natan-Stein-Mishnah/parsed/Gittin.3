        "Any get which is written which is not for the sake of a (specific) woman is invalid.  How?  If one was passing through the shuk and heard the voice of a scholar dictating (to students who were practicing writing gittin), a man so-and-so divorces (his wife) so-and-so, from such-and-such a place, and he said, that is my name and that is the name of my wife, it’s invalid to get divorced with.  Even more than that, he wrote it to divorce his wife and he changed his mind, someone from his town found him and said, my name is like your name and my wife’s name is like your wife’s name, it is invalid to get divorced with it.  Even more than that, if he had two wives and their names were the same, if he wrote it to divorce the older one, he may not divorce the younger one with it.  Even more than that, if he said to the scribe, write it for whichever one I want to marry, it is invalid to get divorced with it.", 
        "One who writes the texts of gittin (standard part which is the same for every get) must leave space for the man, space for the woman, and space for the date.  (If he wrote the texts for) loan documents, he must leave space for the lender, space for the borrower, space for the (amount of) money, and space for the date.  Bills of purchase, he must leave space for the buyer, space for the seller, space for the money, place for the field (to designate which field is being sold), and place for the date, because of the decree (that scribes could write these blank documents in order to make it easier for them).  Rabi Yehuda invalidate them all.  Rabi Elazar validates them all except for gittin of women, for it says, “and he shall write for her,” (meaning) for her sake.", 
        "One who is delivering a get and lost it, if he found it immediately, it’s valid, and if not, it’s invalid (we fear it might be another get with the same names).  If he finds it in a small bag, case (in which he was carrying it), or he recognizes it, it’s valid.  One who brings a get and he left him (the husband who gave the get), old or sick he gives it to her assuming he is alive.  A bet yisra’el who is married to married to a kohen, and he husband went overseas, she eats truma based on the precedent that he is alive.  One who sends a chatat from overseas they offer it with the precedent that he is alive.", 
        "Three things Rabi Eliezer ben Parta said before the Chachamim and they enacted his words.  About a city which is under siege, a ship which is being torn apart in the sea, and on one who is going to be tried (in court in a capital case), that they have precedent for being alive.  But a city which was captured by besiegers, a ship which was lost at sea, and one going out to be killed, they put upon him the stringencies of the living and the stringencies of the dead, a bat yisra’el (married) to a kohen and a bat kohen to a yisra’el, she may not eat truma.", 
        "One who delivers a get in Israel (meaning he does not have to testify to his presence at the making of the get) and becomes sick, behold he sends it in the hand of another.  And if he (the husband) said to him, take such-and-such an object from her for me, he may not send it in another’s hand, for it is not his wish to have his deposit in the hand of another. ", 
        "One who delivers a get from overseas and becomes sick, the court makes (a second messenger) and delivers it, and he (the one who got sick) says before them, before me it was written and before me it was signed  And the second messenger does not have to say, before me it was written and before me it was signed, rather he says, I am the messenger of the court.", 
        "One who lends money to a kohen, a levi, or a poor person, such that (on condition that) they would keep their part (the tithes due to them in order to exempt him from having to separate later), he separates based on them with precedent that they are alive, and he does not have to worry that the kohen or levi died or the poor person became rich.  If they died, he gets authorization (to retain his tithes).  If he lent in court, he does not need authorization from the heirs.", 
        "One who sets down (aside) produce to separate from them truma and ma’asrot, (or) money to separate from them ma’aser sheni, he separates from them with precedent that they (the things he already separated) exist.  If they were lost, behold he worries from time to time (re-evaluates every day), according to Rabi Elazar ben Shamu’a.  Rabi Yehuda says, at three points they check the wine (from a truma and ma’aser perspective), at the east wind on motzei Sukkot, when the blossom falls (from the wine), and at the time the water enters the unripe grapes (when they start to moisten)."
