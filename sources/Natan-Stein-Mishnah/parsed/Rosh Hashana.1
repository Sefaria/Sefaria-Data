        "There are four Rosh Hashanas, on the first of Nisan is Rosh Hashana for kings (counting a new year of reign) and for holidays (counting the festivals), the first of Elul Rosh Hashana for the ma’aser of animals.  Rabi Eliezer and Rabi Shimon say, on the first of Tishray.  The first of Tishray is Rosh Hashana for the years, shmitta, yovel, for planting, and for vegetables.  The first of Shvat is the Rosh Hashana for the tree, according to Shamay.  Beit Hillel says, on the fifteenth of it.", 
        "At four points the world is judged, on Pesach for produce, Shavuot for fruits, Rosh Hashana all people in the world pass before him like flocks of sheep, as it says, “the one who creates their hearts together understands all of their deeds.”  An on Sukkot, it is judged for water.", 
        "On six months the emissaries go out, Nisan because of Pesach, Av because of the fast, Elul because of Rosh Hashana, Tishray to fix the times, Kislev because of Chanuka, and Adar because of Purim.  And when the Beit Hamikdash existed, they would go out even on Iyar because of Pesach Katan (for those who were tame on the first Pesach).", 
        "For two months they desecrate the Shabbat, on Nisan and Tishray, for on them the emissaries went to Syria, and with them they would fix the times.  And when the Beit Hamikdash existed, they would desecrate it even for every month, in order to fix the korban (so that the musaf on Rosh Chodesh would be at the right time).", 
        "Whether it was clearly seen or not clearly seen, one desecrates Shabbat over it.  Rabi Yossi says, if it was not clearly seen, one does not desecrate Shabbat for it.", 
        "Once more than forty pairs came (to testify that they had seen the new moon), and Rabi Akiva stopped them in Lod (because people had already testified).  Raban Gamliel sent to him, if you hinder the many, it will be found that they will fail (to come) in the future (even though we might need them).", 
        "a father and son who see the new moon go.  Not that they can combine with each other (to give testimony) rather that if one of them is invalid, the second will combine with some other person.  Rabi Shimon says, a father and son and all relatives are valid for testimony about the month.  Rabi Yossi said, there was a story with Tovya the doctor, who saw the new moon in Yerushalayim with his son and freed slave.  The kohanim accepted him and his son, and invalidated his slave.  And when they came before the court, they accepted him and his slave and invalidated his son.", 
        "These gamblers, usurers, pigeon stealers, those who sell shmitta produce, and slaves.  This is the general rule, all testimony for which a woman is not valid even they are not valid.", 
        "One who saw the new moon and cannot walk, they lead him on a donkey, even in a bed.  And if people are waiting for them (as an ambush) they take sticks in their hands (to defend themselves).  If the way is long, they take food in their hands.  For on a walk of a day and a night they may desecrate Shabbat and go out for testimony of the new moon as it says, “these are the times of Hashem… which you should call them in their time.”"
