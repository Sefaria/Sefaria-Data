        "One who moves jugs of wine from place to place, he may not bring them in a basket or hamper, but he may bring them on his shoulders or in front of him (with his hands or clutching to his body).  And so too one who carries hay, he may not sling the hamper behind him, rather he brings it in his hands.  And one starts (taking) from a pile of hay, but not from wood in a backyard.", 
        "One may not take wood from a shack, only from what is next to it (the shack).  One may bring wood from the field from that which is gathered and from the karpef (a guarded area outside a city where people could store things), even from the scattered.  What is a karpef?  Anything close to the city, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Yossi says, anything which one enters with a key (alone) even inside the limits for Shabbat (2,000 amot from town).", 
        "One may not chop wood (for firewood), not from boards (which have a general purpose of construction) and not from a board which broke on Yom Tov, and one may not chop with an axe, saw, or sickle, only with a cleaver.  A house which is full of produce which was closed (the entrance was piled with bricks) and it opened, he may take from the place of the opening.  Rabi Meir says, he may even open from the outset and take.", 
        "One may not open a lamp (a clay lamp was made by pressing one’s fist into clay, creating a cavity) because that is making a vessel.  And one may not make ashes on Yom Tov, and one may not cut a wick in two.  Rabi Yehuda says, he may cut it with fire to two lamps.", 
        "One may not brake earthenware, and one may not cut paper (and soak in oil) to roast a salted fish on it (this prevented it from burning).  One may not rake out oven or a stove, but one may press down (the ashes to make it more usable).  And one may not put two barrels together to support a pot on them, and one may not support a pot on a chip of wood, and so too with a door (for wood may only be used as firewood on Yom Tov).  And one may not lead an animal with a staff on Yom Tov, and Rabi Elazar beRebi Shimon allows.", 
        "Rabi Eliezer says, a person may take a toothpick which is before him to clean his teeth and he may gather from a courtyard and light, for everything which is in a courtyard is prepared.  And Chachamim say, he may gather from what is before him and light.", 
        "One may not send forth fire, not from wood (rubbing together), not from stones (striking), not from earth (digging in dry earth produces sparks), and not from water (placing tinder under a glass of water in the sun).  And one may not warm tiles to roast with them.  Furthermore said Rabi Eliezer, a person may stand in a back yard on erev Shabbat in shvi’it (so no ma’aser must be taken) and say, I am eating from here tomorrow.  Chachamim say, (not) until hw will mark it and say, from here to here."
