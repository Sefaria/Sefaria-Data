        "One who finds tfillin (and fears it might become tame) can carry them in pair by pair (by putting them on).  Raban Gamliel says, two by two.  What is this talking about?  With old ones (clearly tfillin with holiness), but with new ones he’s patur (they may be missing an aspect and therefore may not be actual tfillin).  If he found them in sets or bundles, he waits until it gets dark and brings them.  In (times of) danger, he covers them and continues on his way.", 
        "Rabi Shimon says, one may give to his friend, and his friend to his friend, until it gets to an outer courtyard.  And so too with his son, he can give to his friend, and his friend to his friend, even one hundred.  Rabi Yehuda says, one may give a barrel to his friend, and his friend to his friend, even outside of the city limits.  They said to him, it (the barrel) may not go more than the feet (distance from its spot) than its owner (i.e. 2,000 amot from where it is).", 
        "One was reading a book on the threshold and the book rolled from his hand, he may roll it to himself.  He was reading on a roof and the book rolled from his hand, until it reaches ten tfachim (from the ground), he may roll it to himself.  If it reaches ten tfachim, he turns it on its writing (a respectful position).  Rabi Yehuda says, even if it is removed from the ground by even a needle’s worth he may roll it to himself.  Rabi Shimon says, even if it is on the ground itself, he may roll it to himself, for a thing of shvut (rabbinically prohibited work on Shabbat) does not stand in the way of the holy writings.", 
        "A ledge in front of a window one may put on it and take from it on Shabbat.  A person may stand in a private domain and move objects in the public domain or (stand in) the public domain and move objects in the private domain, as long as he doesn’t move from four amot.", 
        "A person may not stand in a private domain and urinate into the public domain, or (stand in) the public domain and urinate into a private domain.  And so too he shouldn’t spit.  Rabi Yehuda says, even when spit is detached in his mouth, he may not walk four amot until he spits.", 
        "A person may not stand in a private domain and drink in the public domain, or in the public domain and drink in a private domain, unless he brings his head and most of his body into the place he is drinking.  And so too with a winepress.  One may catch from a gutter lower than ten tfachim, and from a pipe, he may drink from anywhere.", 
        "A cistern in the public domain with a lip more than ten tfachim high, (people in) a window above it may fill from it on Shabbat.  A garbage pile in the public domain taller than ten tfachim, (people in) a window above it may pour water onto it on Shabbat.", 
        "A tree which overshadows the ground, if its branches are less than three tfachim above the ground, one may carry under it.  If its roots are more than three tfachim above the ground, he may not sit on them.  A door which is in an area designated for a certain purpose and thorns in a hole in a wall (to stop them up) or (reed) mats (in a hole) one may not close with them (closing a hole with them does not seem like a door but rather building), unless they are above the ground.", 
        "A person may not stand in a private domain and open (something locked) in the public domain, or (stand) in the public domain and open in a private domain, unless he made a divider ten tfachim high according to Rabi Meir.  They said to him, once in a fattener’s shuk in Yerushalayim that they would lock and put the key in the window which is on top of the opening.  Rabi Yossi says, it was a shuk of wool dealers.", 
        "A bolt which has a knob on top, Rabi Elazar forbids (licking with it) and Rabi Yossi allows.  Rabi Elazar said, once in the shul in Tveria they did it as if permitted until Raban Gamliel and the Zekenim came and forbade it.  Rabi Yossi says, they treated it as assur and Rabi Yehuda and the Zekenim came and allowed it.", 
        "A bolt which is dragged, one may lock the Beit Hamikdash with it, but not in the country, but if it is lying (on the ground) it is assur in both places.  Rabi Yehuda says, if it is lying it is mutar in the Beit Hamikdash, and the dragged one in the country (is mutar).", 
        "One may replace the lower hinge in the Beit Hamikdash, but not in the country, and the top one, it’s assur in both.  Rabi Yehuda says, the top one (is mutar) in the Beit Hamikdash and the lower (is mutar) in the country.", 
        "One may replace a band-aid in the Beit Hamikdash, but not in the country.  If it’s for the first time (not replacing), it’s assur in both.  One may tie a cord in the Beit Hamikdash, but not in the country, if it’s the first time (not retying) it’s assur in both.  One may cut off a wart in the Beit Hamikdash, but not in the country, if with a vessel, it’s assur I both.", 
        "A kohen who got hurt on his finger, he may wrap reed grass around it in the Beit Hamikdash, but not in the country, if its to bleed himself, it’s assur in both.  One may scatter salt on a ramp so that people don’t slip, and one may fill from the pilgrim’s well or the great well with a pulley on Shabbat, and from the hakar well on Yom Tov.", 
        "A sheretz which was found in the Beit Hamikdash, a kohen carries it out with his belt in order not to let the tuma stay according to Rabi Yochanan ben Broka.  Rabi Yehuda says, with wooden tongs so as not to increase the tuma.  From where do they bring it out?  From the sanctuary, the entrance hall, and from between the entrance hall and the mizbe’ach according to Rabi Shimon ben Nanas.  Rabi Akiva says, a place where one is chayav karet for intentionally (entering) and a chatat for unintentionally (entering), from there we remove it, and all other places they put over it a large pot.  Rabi Shimon says, a place where the Chachamim allowed you they gave you what was (already) yours (i.e. already mutar), for they didn’t allow for you (an act) unless it is (assur) because of shvut."
