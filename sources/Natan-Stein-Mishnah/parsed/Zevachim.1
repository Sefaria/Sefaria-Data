        "All zvachim (animal offerings) which were offered not for their sake (with intentions for an offering different from what was being offered) are valid, but the owners did not offer them for their obligation (if the owner was obligated to offer such a zevach, he did not fulfill his obligation), except for the pesach (paschal offering) and the chatat (sin offering, in both cases they are invalid if slaughtered not for their sake), the pesach (is invalid) in its time (if in any time where it invalid as a pesach anyway, it is considered a shlamim, peace offering, and is valid) and the chatat (is invalid) at any time.  Rabi Eliezer says, also an asham (guilt offering is invalid), (so) the pesach in its time and the chatat and asham at any time.  Rabi Eliezer said, the chatat comes (is brought) for a sin and the asham is brought for a sin, just as a chatat is pasul if not for its sake, so too an asham is pasul if not for its sake.", 
        "Yossi ben Choni says, (offerings) which are slaughtered in the name of a pesach or in the name of a chatat (though it is not one) are pasul.  Shimon Achi Azarya says, if he slaughtered them for the sake of something higher (a korban which is holier) than them, they are valid, but if for the sake of something lower than them, they are pasul.  How?  Holy of holies (the most holy korbanot) which he slaughtered for the sake of light holies (the less holy korbanot) are pasul, but light holies which he slaughtered for the sake of the holy of holies are kasher, a bechor (firstborn animal) and ma’aser (an animal tithe) which he slaughtered for the sake of a shlamim (peach offering) are kasher (for they are light holies and it is holy of holies), but shlamim which he sacrificed for the sake of a bechor or the sake of ma’aser, they are pasul.", 
        "A pesach which was slaughtered in the morning of the fourteenth (on Nissan, though it must be slaughtered after midday on the fourteenth) not for its sake, Rabi Yehoshua declares it valid, as id it was slaughtered on the thirteenth.  Ben Bteira declares invalid, as if it was slaughtered in the evening (which is a proper time).  Shimon ben Azay said, I have accepted (a ruling) from the seventy-two elders on the day that they in instituted Rabi Elazar ben Azarya (as head) in the yeshiva (study hall) that all zvachim which are eaten which were offered not for their sake are kasher, but the owners did not offer them for their obligations, except for the pesach and the chatat.  And Azay did not add anything other than the olah (elevation offering which is not eaten), but the Chachamim did not agree with him.", 
        "The pesach and the chatat which he slaughtered not for their sake, if he accepted (the blood), brought (to the mizbe’ach), or sprinkled (the blood) not for their sake or for their sake and not for their sake, they are pasul.  How is it for their sake and not for their sake?  If (he started his action) for the sake of a peach and (finished his action) for the sake of a shlamim.  (How is it) not for its sake and for its sake?  (If he stared) for the sake of a shlamim (and then) for the sake of a pesach.  A zevach can be invalidated with (having a different intention for any of) four things, slaughtering, accepting, bringing, and sprinkling.  Rabi Shimon validates (even if one had improper intention) in bringing, for Rabi Shimon would say, it is not possible (to have a korban) without slaughtering, without accepting, or without sprinkling, but it can be without bringing (as in a case where) he slaughters on the side of the mizbe’ach and sprinkles (right there).  Rabi Eliezer says, if one brings in a case where he has to bring, a though (of a different intention) invalidates, but in a place where it does not need to be brought, a thought does not invalidate."
