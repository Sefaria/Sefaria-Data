        "Four vows the Chachamim untied, vows of urging, vows of exaggeration, vows in error, and vows which are forced.  Vows of urging, how?  One was selling an object, and said, konam that I don’t lower (the price below) a sela (four dinarim) for you, and that one says, konam I don’t raise for you above a shekel (two dinarim), they both want for three dinarim.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, also one who wants to vow for his friend that he will eat with him.  (the mishna teaches another law,) if he says, any vow I will swear is void, as long as he remembers it at the time of the vow.", 
        "Vows of exaggeration, he said, konam if I didn’t see on this path like (the number of) those exiting Egypt, if I didn’t see a snake (thick) as the beam of an olive press (neither of which is fathomably true). Vows in error, if I ate and if I drank, and he remembered that he ate and drank, if I eat and if I drink, and he forgot and ate and drank.  He said, konam my wife benefiting me, for she stole from my pocket, for she hit my son, and he found out that she didn’t hit and she didn’t steal.  He saw them eating (his) figs and said, behold they are upon you like korban, and he found (when he got closer and could recognize them) that they were his father and brother, and there were others with them, Beit Shamay says, they are mutar, and those with them are assur.  Beit Hillel says, both are mutar.", 
        "Vows which are forced, his friend made him vow he would eat by him, and he (the forced taker of the vow) got sick, or his son got sick, or a river hindered him, behold, there are vows which are forced.", 
        "One may vow to murderers, thieves, and tax collectors that it (some property) is truma, even if it isn’t truma, that it is of the house of the king, even though they are not of the house of the king.  Beit Shamay says, one may make any vow, except an oath (shvua).  Beit Hillel says, (one may vow) even with an oath. Beit Shamay says, he will not open (offer) to him a vow, and Beit Hillel says, he may even open for him.  Beit Shamay says, when he forces him to swear, and Beit Hillel says even when he doesn’t make him swear.  How?  They said to him, say, konam my wife benefits from me, and he said, konam my wife and children benefit from me, Beit Shamay says his wife is mutar and his children are assur, and Beit Hillel says both are mutar.", 
        "(If one says) behold these plants are korban if they aren’t knocked down (he says this on a windy day when he fears they will be knocked down), this cloak is korban if it doesn’t burn (when he fears it will burn), he must redeem (buy a korban for its value, for we do not feel this was a vow made in error).  Behold these plants are korban until they are knocked down, this cloak is korban until it burns, he doesn’t have to redeem them.", 
        "One who vows against (benefiting from) seafarers is mutar in land dwellers (even if they go sailing, if they do not normally do such, they are mutar).  From land dwellers, he is assur from seafarers, for seafarers are included in land dwellers, and not from one who goes from Ako to Yafo (a short journey) but one whose way is to sail (far distances away from land).", 
        "One who swears against those who see the sun is assur even by the blind, for he didn’t have intention other than those who the sun sees (all people).", 
        "One who vows against the black headed (referring to black hair) is assur by the bald and the white haired, and is mutar by women and children, for one does not call black headed except for men.", 
        "One who vows against yilodim (referring to people who have been born) is mutar by the noladim (those who will be born in the future), from the noladim is assur from yilodim, Rabi Meir permits (the one who vows against noladim) also (to) yilodim.  Chachamim say, this one didn’t intend except for these whose way it is to give birth.", 
        "One who vows against those who rest on Shabbat is assur by a yisra’el and assur by a kuti.  From those who eat garlic (as a custom on Friday nights) is assur by a yisra’el and assur by a kuti.  From those who go up to Yerushalayim, is assur by a yisra’el and mutar by a kuti.", 
        "Yud Konam that I do not benefit from the children of Noach is mutar by a yisra’el and assur by the nations of the world.  That I do not benefit from the offspring of Avraham, is assur by a yisra’el and mutar by the nations of the world.  That I do not benefit from a yisra’el, buys for more and sells for less (than market price, for he is not benefiting).  That yisra’elim do not benefit from me he buys for less and sells for more if they listen to him (will trade with him).  That I do not benefit from them and them from me, he benefits a non-Jew.  Konam that I do not benefit from the uncircumcised, he is mutar by the uncircumcised of yisra’el and assur by the circumcised of the nations, for uncircumcised is not used except for as a name for non-Jews, as it says, “for all the [other] nations are uncircumcised and all the house of yisra’el is uncircumcised in the heart,” and it says, “and this uncircumcised Philistine will be,” and, “lest the daughters of the Philistines be happy, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice.”  Rabi Elazar ben Azarya says, disgusted is the foreskin, for the wicked are disparaged for it, as it says, “for all the [other] nations are uncircumcised.”  Rabi Yishma’el says, (brit) mila is great (in importance), for thirteen covenants were sealed on it.  Rabi Yossi says, mila is great for pushes off the more stringent Shabbat.  Rabi Yehoshua ben Karcha says, mila is great for Moshe the tzaddik was not spared for it (for not performing it) for even an hour.  Rabi Nechemia says, mila is great for it pushes off divine afflictions (while one may not cut off tzara’at, if there is on a foreskin, one may still cut off the foreskin).  Rabi says, mila is great for all of the mitzvot which Avraham our father did, he was not called complete until he was circumcised, as it says, “walk yourself before me and be complete.”  Another thing, mila is great for were it not for it, Hashem would not have created His world, as it says, “so said Hashem, if it is not my covenant day and night, the laws of heavens and earth I would not have put."
