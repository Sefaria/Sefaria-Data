        "How does one roast the pesach?  One brings a spit of pomegranate (wood), he thrusts it from his mouth to its anus, and he puts its legs and entrails inside it, according to Rabi Yossi Hagelili.  Rabi Akiva says, this is a form of cooking (not roasting) rather, one hangs it (on the spit) outside of it.", 
        "One may not roast the pesach on a spit or grill.  Rabi Tzadok said, once Raban Gamliel said to Tavi his slave, go out and roast the pesach for us on the grill.  If it touched the clay of an oven, he must peel off that place.  If some of its gravy dripped into fine flour, he must remove (a handful) from that place.", 
        "One rubbed it in truma oil, if it’s a group of kohanim, they may eat.  If a yisra’el, if it’s still raw, he washes it off, if it’s cooked, he peels off the outside.  If he rubbed it in oil of ma’aser sheni he may not charge its value (if he is splitting the cost with the group), for ma’aser sheni may not be redeemed in Yerushalayim.", 
        "Five things may come (as an offering) while (the kohanim or holy things) are tame, and may not be eaten while tame, omer, the two breads (on Shavuot), the showbreads, public shlamim offerings (on Atzeret), and the goats of Rosh Chodesh.  A pesach which comes while tame is eaten while tame, for it only came in the beginning in order to be eaten.", 
        "If the meat became tame but the chelev remained, he does not sprinkle the blood.  If the chelev became tame but the meat remained, he does sprinkle the blood.  And with things made holy it’s not like this, even if the meat became tame and the chelev remained, he sprinkled the blood.", 
        "If the community became tame or most of it did, or the kohanim are tame and the community is tahor, they do it (the pesach) while tame.  If a minority of the community became tame, the tahor do it first, and the tame do it second.", 
        "A pesach which had its blood sprinkled and after that they found out it was tame, the tzitz (golden head plate of the kohen gadol) accepts it (the tzitz is made to accept sins against holy things).  If the body became tame (the owners were found to be tame), the tzitz does not accept, for they said, a nazir and one who makes a pesach, the tzitz accepts on the tuma of the blood, and the tzitz does not accept on the tuma of the body.  If he became tame with a tuma of tehom (when it is discovered that there was a corpse under a place he walked), the tzitz accepts.", 
        "If the whole (pesach) or most of it became tame, they burn it before the birah (a place in the Beit Hamikdash) with wood from the pile.  If a minority of it became tame or (if there is) notar (leftovers) they burn it in their courtyards or on their roofs with their own wood.  Misers burn it before the birah in order to benefit from the pile of wood.", 
        "A pesach which was taken out (from Yerushalayim) or became tame must be burnt immediately.  If the owners became tame or they died, its form is violated (it is now notar) and it is burnt on the sixteenth.  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka says, even this should be burnt immediately, for it has no eaters.", 
        "The bones, the tendons, and the notar must be burnt on the sixteenth.  If the sixteenth fell out on Shabbat, they must burn on the seventeenth, for it does not push of either Shabbat or Yom Tov.", 
        "Whatever is eaten from a large ox is eaten of a tender kid, and the wing tips (shoulder blades) and certain cartilages and floating ribs.  One who breaks a bone in a tahor pesach is lashed forty, but one who leaves over meat (even) of a tahor or breaks a bone of a tame is not lashed forty.", 
        "A limb which partly went out (of its bounds for being eaten), he cuts until he reaches the bone, flays until he reaches a joint, and cuts (thus getting rid of the entire limb).  With other sacrifices, he can chop with a cleaver, for there is no problem of breaking a bone.  From the doorpost inward, (is considered space) as if inside, from the doorpost outward, as if outside.  And windows and the thickness of the walls, as if inside.", 
        "Two groups who were eating in one house, one group may turn facing there and eat, and those turn and face there and eat, and the kettle (to dilute wine with) is between them.  And when the waiter stands to mix, he closes his mouth and turns his face until he gets to his group, and then he eats.  And a bride may turn her face and eat."
