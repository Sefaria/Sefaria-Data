        "One who brings a get (refers to any legal document, but generally refers to a divorce document) from overseas must say, before me it was written and before me it was signed (for a get is signed by two witnesses).  Raban Gamliel says, also one who brings (a get) from Rakem and Chever (cities near Israel).  Rabi Eliezer says, even from Kfar Lodin (outside of Israel and close) to Lod (in Israel).  Chachamim say, he does not have to say, before me it was written and before me it was signed, unless he brings it from overseas (far away) or takes it (from Israel overseas).  And one who brings from country to country in the overseas countries must say, before we it was written and before me it was signed.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.", 
        "Rabi Yehuda says (outside of Israel is anywhere), from Rekem and eastward, and Rekem is like the east, from Ashkelon and southward, and Ashkelon is like the south, and from Akko northward, and Akko is like the north.  Rabi Meir says, Akko is like Israel for (the matter of) gittin.", 
        "One who brings a get in Israel does not have to say, before me it was written, and before me it was signed.    If there is an appeal about it, it will stand based on its signatories (the people who signed will confirm).  One who brings a get from overseas and cannot say, before me it was written and before me it was signed, if there are witnesses, it will stand by its signatories.", 
        "Whether the get of women (divorce documents) or (documents for the) release of slaves, the one who takes and the one who brings are the same (in their requirements).  (This is) one of the ways the women’s gittin and (the document) for the release of a slave are the same.", 
        "Any document which has a kuti witness is invalid, except for the gittin of women and to free a slave.  There was a case where they brought before Raban Gamliel at Kfar Otnay the get of a woman, and the witnesses were kutim, and he validated it.  All bills which come from the courts of non-Jews, even though their signatories are non-Jews, are valid, except for the gittin of women and the freeing of slaves.  Rabi Shimon says, also these are valid, they are not mentioned other than in a time where they are done by laymen (as opposed to the courts).", 
        "One who says (to a messenger), give this get to my wife and this bill of release to my slave, if he wants to return on both of them (before they are given), he may return, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, by the gittin of women, but not by the freeing of slaves, for one can merit for a person who is not before him (freeing the slave on his behalf) but one does not obligate for another (the get) other than in his presence.  For if he wants not to maintain his slave, he has the right (meaning the slave is not losing any right by being freed) but not to maintain his wife, he is not permitted (and she is losing the right to maintenance by getting a get).  He (Rabi Meir) said to them (the Chachamim), behold, is he not invalidating the slave from eating truma just as he is invalidating the wife?  They said to him, because he (the slave) is his property.  One who says, give this get to my wife and this bill of release to my slave, and he died, they do not give after death.  (If one said) give a maneh to so-and-so, and he died, they give (the money to the person) after death."
