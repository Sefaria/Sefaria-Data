        "One who has sex with his yevama whether accidentally, intentionally, if forced, willingly, even if he is accidental (he doesn’t have intention) and she is intentionally, he is intentionally and she is accidental, he is forced and she isn’t forced, or she is forced and he isn’t forced, whether (the act was) partial or completed, he acquired her.  And there is no difference between sex and sex (this phrase is explained as meaning between natural ways of sex and unnatural ones).", 
        "And so too one who has sex with one of all the inappropriate relations which are in the torah or if they are pasul, such as a widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee or a chalutza to a lay kohen, a mamzer or netina to a yisra’el, or the bat of a yisra’el to a mamzer or natin, she is pasul (to any further kohen), and there is not difference between sex and sex.", 
        "A widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee or chalutza to a lay kohen, from engagement they may not eat truma.  Rabi Elazar and Rabi Shimon validate.  If they became a widow or a divorcee, from marriage they were pasul and from engagement they are valid.", 
        "A kohen gadol may not marry a widow, whether a widow from engagement or a widow from marriage.  And he may not marry a bogeret (a woman twelve years, six months, and one day old, i.e. six months after puberty).  Rabi Elazar and Rabi Shimon validate a bogeret.  He may not marry one who was hit (penetrated) with wood.  He engaged a widow and he was appointed to be the kohen gadol, he may marry her.  And there was a story with Yehoshua ben Gamla who engaged Marta bat Beitos, the king appointed him as kohen gadol, and he married her.  One waiting for yibum who fell before (was waiting for) a lay kohen and he was appointed to be the kohen gadol, even though he made her a contractual marriage, behold he will not marry.  A kohen gadol whose brother died does chalitza but not yibum.", 
        "A lay kohen may not marry a barren woman unless he (already) has a wife and children.  Rabi Yehuda says, even if he has a wife and children, he may not marry a barren woman, for she (is like) a whore (two him, for she cannot have children) as is said in the torah.  And Chachamim say, ‘whore’ is nothing but a convert and a freedwoman and one who had sex in the way of a whore.", 
        "A person may not abstain from being fruitful and multiplying (having children) unless he has children.  Beit Shamay says, two males.  Beit Hillel says, a male and a female, as it says, “male and female He created them.”  If he married a woman and waited with her ten years and she didn’t give birth, he may not abstain.  If he divorced her, she may marry another.  And the second (husband) may wait with her ten years.  And if she miscarried, he counts from the time she miscarried.  The man is commanded in being fruitful and multiplying, but not the woman.  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka says, on both of them it says, “and Hashem blessed them and said to them… be fruitful and multiply.”"
