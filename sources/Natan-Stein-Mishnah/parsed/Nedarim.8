        "(If a person said,) konam wine that I taste today, he is only assur until it become dark.  (If he said) this week, he is assur the whole week and Shabbat (is counted with the week) which passed (meaning Shabbat is deemed the end of the week).  This month, he is assur the whole month, and Rosh Chodesh is for that which will come (counts as the beginning of a new month).  This year, he is assur the whole year, and Rosh Hashana is for that which will come.  This cycle-week (seven years, one yovel cycle), he is assur the whole cycle-week, and shvi’it is with the passed.  And if he said, one day, one week, one month, one year, one cycle-week he is assur from day to day (exactly that amount of time from the time he vowed).", 
        "Until Pesach, he is assur until it comes.  Until it (Pesach comes, he is chayav until it goes out.  Until before Pesach, Rabi Meir says, he’s assur until it comes.  Rabi Yossi says, he’s assur until it goes out.", 
        "Until harvest, until grape harvest, until olive harvest, he isn’t assur except until it comes.  This is the general rule, anything that its time is set and he said until it comes, he is assur until it comes, and if he said until it is, he is assur until it goes out.  Anything which its time isn’t set, whether he said until it is or until it comes he isn’t assur except for until it comes.", 
        "Until summer, until it is summer, (lasts) until the nation begins to bring in baskets (of figs from harvest).  Until summer passes, until people fold up their fig knives (signifying the end of the harvest).  Until the harvest, until the nation begins to harvest the harvest of wheat, but not the harvest of barley.  All goes according to the place of his vow.  If he was on a mountain (the vow goes according to) the mountain, and if in a valley, by the valley.", 
        "Until the rains, until there are rains, until the second revia (periods of rainfall) falls.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, until the time of the revai comes (even if rain does not fall).  Until the rains stop, until all of Nisan has been (passed) according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, until Pesach passes.  Konam wine that I will not taste this year, and the year was made a leap year, he is assur during the year and its leap year addition.  Until the beginning of Adar, until the beginning of the first Adar.  Until the end of Adar, until the end of the first Adar.  Rabi Yehuda says, konam wine that I will not taste until it is Pesach, he isn’t assur except until the night of Pesach, for he did not intend this (in a fashion) other that until the time that it is the way of people to drink wine.", 
        "He said, konam meat that I will not taste until it is the fast, he isn’t assur except  until the night of the fast, for he did not intend this other than until the time that it is the way of people to eat meat.  Rabi Yossi his (Rabi Yehuda’s) son says, konam garlic that I will not taste until it is Shabbat, he isn’t assur except until Shabbat night, for he didn’t intend this other than until the time that it is the way of people to eat garlic.", 
        "One who says to his fried, konam that I will benefit from you if you don’t come and take for your children a kor of wheat and two barrels of wine, behold this one (the one vowed against) may nullify the vow of that (the one making the vow) without the agreement of a wise person and say to him you didn’t say anything except for my honor (my honor was your intention), and this (me not taking) is my honor.  And so too he may say to his friend, konam that you do not benefit from me if you do not come and give my children a kor of wheat and two barrels of wine.  Rabi Meir says, he is assur until he gives.  Chachamim say, also this one can nullify the vow of that one without the agreement of a wise person and say, behold I am as if I received.  They urged him (some person) to marry his sister’s daughter and he says, konam she ever benefits from me, and so too one who was divorcing his wife and said, konam my wife ever benefits from me, behold they are mutar to benefit from him, for he didn’t mean this except for the issue of marriage.  He was urging his friend to eat by him and (the one urged) said, konam I will come into your house, that I will taste a drop of cold water by you, his is mutar to enter his house and to drink cold water from him, for he didn’t intend this except for the issue of eating and drinking."
