        "One who steals wood and makes it into vessels, or wool and makes it into clothes, he pays according to the time of theft.  If he stole a pregnant cow and it gave birth, a loaded ewe (full of wool) and sheared it, he pays the money of a cow ready to give birth or a ewe ready to be shorn.  If he stole a cow and it got pregnant by him and gave birth, a ewe and it became loaded by him and he sheared it, he pays according to the time of theft.  This is the general rule, all thieves pay according to the time of theft.", 
        "If he stole an animal and it aged, or slaves and they aged, he pays according to the time of theft.  Rabi Meir says, by slaves he says to him, behold yours are before you (meaning he simply gives them back).  If he stole a coin and it cracked, fruit and it rotted, or wine and it turned (to vinegar), he pays according to the time of theft.  A coin and it became invalid, truma and it became tame, chametz (leavened bread) and Pesach passed (if it is owned by a Jew over Pesach it is assur to eat) or an animal and a transgression was done with it, it became invalid for the mizbe’ach, or it was going out to be stoned, he says to him, behold yours is before you.", 
        "If he gave (an item of his) to artisans to fix and they broke it, they (the artisans) are chayav to pay.  If he gave a carpenter a chest, an ark, or a tower (three types of boxes), to fix, and he broke them, he is chayav to pay.  And a builder who accepted upon himself to dismantle a wall and broke the stones or damaged (someone), he is chayav to pay.  If he was dismantling on this side and it fell on another side, he’s patur, but if it was a result of his striking, he’s chayav.", 
        "One who gives his wool to a dyer and the cauldron burned it, he gives him the money of the wool.  If he dyed it uglily, if the improvement (to the wool’s value) is more than the cost (of dying), he (the customer) gives (pays) him the cost, but if the cost if greater than the improvement, he pays (the value of) the improvement.  (if he gave the wool) to dye it red, and he dyed it black, (to dye it) black and he dyed it red, Rabi Meir says, he gives him the value of the wool.  Rabi Yehuda says, if the improvement is more than the cost, he gives him the cost, but if the cost is greater than the improvement, he gives him the improvement.", 
        "One who steals from his friend the worth of a pruta (the smallest coin) and swore to him (that he didn’t steal), he must follow after him (to repay the theft) even to Madai.  He may not give to his son and not to his messenger, but he may give to an agent (appointed by) the court.  But if he died, he returns to his heirs.", 
        "If he (a thief) gave him the principal but did not give him the chomesh (an extra fifth which is added when a person falsely denies a loan or theft), if he (the lender) forgave him the principal but did not forgive him on the chomesh, forgave him for this and that, except for less the worth of a pruta of the principal, he does not have to go after him.  If he gave him the chomesh but he did not give him the principal, he forgave him the chomesh but did not forgive him the principle, or forgave him on this and that except for the worth of a pruta of the principal, he needs to go after him.", 
        "If he gave him the principal and swore for him about the chomesh (that he had paid it even though he had not), behold he pays chomesh on the chomesh, until the principle (upon which he is paying chomesh) less than the worth of a pruta.  And so too with a deposit (an object left to be guarded), as it says, “with a deposit, pledge, theft, if he oppressed his neighbor, or a lost object and he denied it and swore falsely,” behold this pays the principal, chomesh, and (brings a korban) asham.  (If one says to the other,) where is my deposit?  And he said to him, it was lost, (he said back), I make you swear (that it was lost, and therefore you don’t have to pay), and he said, amen.  (Then) witnesses testify that he ate it, he pays the principal.  If he admitted himself (that he lied) he pays the principal, chomesh, and an asham.", 
        "(If one said to the other,) where is my deposit?  (And he said back,) it was stolen, I make you swear, and he said, amen.  The witnesses testify that he stole it, he pays the restitution of kefel.  If he admitted himself, he pays the principal, chomesh, and an asham.", 
        "One who stole (from) his father, swore to him, and (his father) died, behold this one pays the principal and chomesh to his (father’s) sons (his brothers) or his (father’s) brothers (for he loses his inheritance as long as he has the stolen object).  And if he doesn’t want to (lose his inheritance) or he doesn’t have (enough to waive his inheritance), he borrows, (gives the object to his brothers,) and the lenders come and take (the object from the brothers to pay the loan).", 
        "One who says to his son, konam (expressing a vow against) if you benefit from what is mine,” if he died, he (his son) inherits from him.  (If the father made the vow valid) in his life and after his death, if he died, he (the son) will not inherit from him, and will return to his (the father’s) sons or his (the father’s) brothers.  But if he (the father) doesn’t have, he borrows, and the lenders come and collect.", 
        "One who steals from a convert and swears from him, and he died, behold this one pays the principal and chomesh to the kohanim and an asham to the mizbe’ach, as it says, “and if the person does not have a redeemer for the man (the thief) to return to him, the guilt (what needs to be paid) is returned to Hashem to the kohen, except for the ram of (Yom) Hakippurim by which he will atone for it.”  If he was brining the money and the asham (to Yerushalayim) and died, the money will be given to his sons, and the (animal designated for) the asham will graze until it develops a blemish, will be sold, and its money will fall into a donation (offering).", 
        "If he gave the money to the people of the watch (the kohanim serving at that time and died, the heirs cannot take it out from their hands, as it says, “a man who shall give to the kohen, for him (the kohen) it shall be.”  If he gave the money to (the kohanim of the first watch, that of) Yehoyariv and the asham to (the kohanim of the second watch, that of) Yidaya, he’s yotze (fulfills his obligation).  If he gave the asham to Yehoyariv and the money to Yidaya, if the asham is still extant, the children on Yidaya will offer it, but is not, he must return and bring another asham, for one who brings (the payment for) his theft before his asham is yotze, but if he brought his asham before his theft, he’s not yotze.  If he gave the principal, but not the chomesh, the chomesh does not hinder (the asham)."
