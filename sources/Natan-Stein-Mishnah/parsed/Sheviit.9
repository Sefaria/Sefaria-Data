        "Rue, goosefoot, purslane, hill coriander, water-parsley, and meadow berries are exempt from ma’aser, and may be bought from anyone during shvi’it, because nothing like them is watched.  Rabi Yehuda says, randomly grown mustard is allowed, for we don’t suspect they will have been tended.  Rabi Shimon says, all randomly grown plants are allowed, except for those of cabbage, for there is nothing wild like them.  Chachamim say, all randomly grown things are assur.", 
        "Three different lands have Judea, Transjordan, and the Galil (Galilee), and each of these is three lands.  The upper Galil, the lower Galil, and the valley.  Kfar Chanania and up, where no sycamores grow is the upper Galil.  Kfar Chanina and below, where one grows sycamores is the lower Galil.  The area around Teveria is the valley.  In Yehuda, the hill, the plain, and the valley.  And the plain of Lod is like the plain of the south, and its hill is like the hill of the king.  From Beit Choron until the sea, this is one region.", 
        "Why did they make three lands?  So you could eat in each land until the last of that land is eaten (and then do biur).  Rabi Shimon says, they only made three lands in Judea, and the rest is like the king’s mountain.  And all of the land is one for olives and dates.", 
        "One may still eat what can be found as hefker, but not on that which is protected from animals.  Rabi Yossi allows (delaying biur) even based on the protected.  One may eat based on the vetchling (degenerate crop which will last in the field) and the tree which blooms twice a season, but not on (inferior) autumn grapes.  Rabi Yehuda allows (grapes) from whenever they ripened before the end of summer.", 
        "One preserves three ‘pickles’ in one barrel, Rabi Eliezer says, you eat based on the earliest.  Rabi Yehoshua says, even on the latest.  Raban Gamliel says, whatever is finished in the field has to have biur from that barrel, and the halacha is like him.  Rabi Shimon says, all types of vegetables are like one when it comes to biur.  One can eat portulac until vetches have finished from the Beit Netofa valley.", 
        "One who gathers fresh herbs (may eat them) until the groundwater dries.  One who gathers dry (may eat) until the second rain.  Reed leaves and grape leaves, until they fall from their stems.  One who gathers them dry, until the second rain.  Rabi Akiva says, all of them until the second rain falls.", 
        "Likewise, one who rents his friend’s house until the rain comes has until the second rain.  One who has a vow against taking benefit from his friend until the rains, it lasts until the second rain.  Until when may the poor enter orchards?  Until the second rain.  From when may one use or burn hay or straw of shvi’it?  From the second rain.", 
        "One who had shvi’it produce, and it came time for biur, he allots the food for three meals.  The poor can eat after biur, but not the rich, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Yossi says, both rich and poor may eat after biur.", 
        "One who had produce of shvi’it which he inherited or received as a gift, Rabi Eliezer says, he shall give it to whoever will eat it.  Chachamim say, a sinner doesn’t benefit, rather he will sell it to those who will eat it, and the money he will give to anyone.  One who eats dough from shvi’it before challa was taken is chayav to be killed."
