        "Any hour which it is permitted to eat, one may feed to a domesticated animal, a wild animal, and fowl, he may sell it to a non-Jew, and he is allowed to benefit from it.  If the time passed, he is prohibited from benefiting from it and he may not light with it an oven or stove.  Rabi Yehuda says there is not removal of chametz other than burning, and the Chachamim say, he may also crumble it up and throw it to the wind or cast it to the sea.", 
        "Chametz of a non-Jew which has had Pesach pass over it is allowed to be benefited from, and that of a Jew is assur to have benefit from, as it says, “and leaven shall not be seen to you.”", 
        "A non-Jew who lent to a Jew on (a collateral of) his chametz, after Pesach it may be benefited from.  A Jew who lent to a non-Jew on his chametz, after Pesach it is assur to be benefited from.  Chametz which a ruin fell on behold it is like removed, Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, anything which a dog cannot search after it (is considered removed).", 
        "One who accidentally eats truma chametz on Pesach, he pays the principal plus chomesh.  Intentionally, he’s patur from restitution and from its value as wood (as fuel, since it isn’t used as food on Pesach).", 
        "These are things which a person fulfills his obligation (to eat matza) on Pesach, with wheat, barley, spelt, rye, and oats.  One can fulfill with dmai, ma’aser rishon which its truma has been taken, ma’aser sheni and hekdesh which were redeemed, and kohanim with challa and truma.  But not with tevel, ma’aser rishon which didn’t have its truma taken, ma’aser sheni and hekdesh which weren’t redeemed, and the loaves of a toda (offering) and the wafers of a nazir.  If he made them for himself (to offer) he doesn’t fulfill with them, but if he made them for selling in the shuk (to those he need to make an offering) he fulfills with them.", 
        "And these are vegetables with which one fulfills his obligation (of maror) on Pesach, chazeret (a type of lettuce), chicory, endive, eryngium, and horseradish.  One fulfills with them whether moist or dry, but not pickled, stewed, or cooked.  And they combine to make a kzayit.  One fulfills with their stalk, dmai, ma’aser rishon from which truma has been taken, and with ma’aser sheni and hekdesh which have been redeemed.", 
        "One may not soak bran for chickens, but one may scald it.  A woman may not soak bran that she carries in her hand to the bathhouse, but she may rub her skin dry.  One may not chew wheat and put it on his wound on Pesach, since it leavens.", 
        "One may not put flour in charoset or mustard, but if he did, he must eat it immediately, and Rabi Yossi forbids it.  One may not cook the (korban) pesach, not with liquids or fruit juice, but one may baste and dip it in them.  Water used for the needs of a baker must be spilled, for they leaven."
