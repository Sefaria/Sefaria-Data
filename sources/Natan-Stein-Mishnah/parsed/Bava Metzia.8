        "One who borrowed a cow and asked (for the help of) the owner with it or hired its owner with it, or he asked the owners or hired them and afterwards borrowed the cow, and it died, he’s patur, as it says, “if its owner is with it he shall not pay.”  But if he borrowed the cow and then asked the owners or hired them and it died, he’s chayav, as it says, “if its owner is not with it, pay shall he pay.”", 
        "One who borrows a cow, if he borrowed it half the day and rented it the other half, borrowed it today and rented it for tomorrow, or rented one and borrowed one and it (a cow) died, the lender says, the borrowed one (in the last case) died, (in the second case) the day it was borrowed it died, or (in the first time) during the time it was borrowed it died, and that one (the renter) says, I don’t know, he’s chayav.  If the renter says, the rented one died, on the day it was rented it died, or during the time it was rented it died, and that one says, I don’t know, he’s patur.  If this one says borrowed and that one says rented, the renter must swear that the rented one died.  If this one says, I don’t know and that one says, I don’t know, they will split (the loss).", 
        "One who borrows a cow and he (the lender) sent it to him in the hand of his son, in the hand of his slave, or in the hand of his agent; or (he sent it) in the hand of the son, in the hand of the slave, or in the hand of the agent of the borrower, and it died, he’s patur.  If the borrower said to him, send it to me in the hand of my son, in the hand of my slave, or in the hand of my agent; or (send it) in the hand of your son, in the hand of your slave, or in the hand of your agent of the borrower said to him, behold I am sending it in the hand of my son, in the hand of my slave, or in the hand of my agent; or (I am sending it) in the hand of your son, in the hand of your slave, or in the hand of your agent; the borrower said, send it; he sent it; and it died, he’s chayav.  And so too at the time he returns it.", 
        "One who exchanges a cow for a donkey and it (the cow) gives birth, and so too one who sells his maidservant and she gives birth, this one says, (it gave birth) before I sold, and that one says, from the time I bought it, they split (the value of the child).  If one had two slaves, one large (an adult) and one small (a minor), and so too two fields, one large and one small, if the buyer says, I bought the large one, and that one says, I don’t know, he merited in the large one.  If the seller says, I sole the small one, and that one says, I don’t know, he doesn’t have other than the small.  If this one says large and that one says small, the seller must swear that he sold the small one.  If this one says, I don’t know and that one says, I don’t know, they split (the difference).", 
        "One who sells his olive trees for (the buyer to use as) wood, and they made less than a revi’it (of oil) per se’ah (of olives, meaning the olives were of poor quality), behold these are of the owner of the trees.  If they made a revi’it per se’ah, this one says, my olive trees grew it, and that one says, my land grew it, they split (the oil).  If a river washed out his olive trees and put them into the field of his friend (where they grew olives), this one says, my olive trees grew, and that one says, my land grew, they split it.", 
        "One who rents a house to his friend (for an unspecified amount of time), during the rainy season, he cannot send him out (evict him) from sukkot until Pesach (foe he will not be able to find a vacancy).  In the season of the sun (dry season), (he must give him) thirty days (of warning).  And in cities, whether in the dry season or to rainy season, twelve months.  And with stores, whether in towns or in citied, twelve months.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, a store of bakers or dyers, three years.", 
        "One who rents a house to his friend, the owner is obligated in (ensuring that there is) a door, a bolt, a lock, and anything which is the making of an artisan, but a thing which is not the work of an artisan, the renter makes it.  The manure is (property) of the homeowner, and the renter does not have other than what comes out of the oven and the stove alone.", 
        "One who rents a house to his friend for a year, if the year became a leap year, if became a leap year for (in the favor of) the renter.  If he rented it to him by months, if the year became a leap year, it became a leap year for the owner.  There was a case in Tzippori with one who rented a bathhouse from his friend for twelve gold (dinar, each worth twenty-five dinar) for a year, a golden dinar a month, (and the year became a leap year) and the case came before Raban Shimon ben Gamliel and before Rabi Yossi, and they said, they split the leap month.", 
        "One who rents a house to his friend and it fell, he is obligated to set up for him a (new) house.  If it was small, he may not make it large, (if the house was) large, he may not make it small.  (If there was) one (house), he may not make it two, two, he may not make it one.  He may not subtract from the windows and he may not add to them, except with the knowledge (consent) of both of them."
