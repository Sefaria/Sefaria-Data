        "One who died and left sons and daughters, when the property is great, the sons inherit and the daughters are maintained, when the property is little, the daughters are maintained and the sons ask at the openings (beg).  Admon says, because I am a male I lost?  Raban Gamliel says, I see the words (agree with the opinion) of Admon.", 
        "If he left sons, daughters, and a tumtum (one of unknown gender), when the property is great, the males push him in with the daughters.  When the property is little, the daughters push him with the sons.  One who says, if my wife gives birth to a son, he will take a maneh, if she gave birth to a male, he takes a maneh.  (If he said, if my wife gives birth to a) female, (she will get) two hundred (zuz), if she gave birth to a female, she takes two hundred.  If a make a maneh, if a female two hundred, and she gave birth to a male and a female, the male takes a maneh and the female takes two hundred.  If she gave birth to a tumtum, he does not take.  If he said, anything which my wife gives birth to will take, behold he (the tumtum) takes.  And if there is not heir their other than him, he inherits everything.", 
        "If the left adult and minor sons, if the adult improved the property, they improved for the middle (the estate, to be divided among all the heirs).  If they said, look what our father left us, behold we will do (improve) and eat (what we make), they improves for themselves.  And so to a woman who improved the property, she improved for the middle (the heirs).  If she said, see what my husband left me, behold I am doing an eating, she improved for herself.", 
        "Brothers who were partners, and one fell into a trade, he fell in for the middle (for both of them, if the trade came from their father).  If he (one of the brothers) got sick and was healed, he was healed (using money) from his own.  Brothers who part of them made shushbinot (grooms gifts, given by friends to help the groom cover the costs of the wedding and then reciprocated by the groom when the friend gets married) in the life of the father, if the shushbinot were returned, they were returned to the middle, for shushbinot can be collected in court (if not reciprocated).  But, one who sends to his friends jugs of wine and jugs of oil, they are not collected in court for they are acts of kindness.", 
        "One who sends sivlonot (like shushbinot for a betrothal) to the house of his father-in-law, if he sent there on hundred maneh and ate a groom’s feast there (worth) even a dinar, he may not collect them.  If he did not eat a grooms feast there, behold these can be collected.  If he sent many sivlonot such that they will to return with her to the house of her husband, behold these are collected.  (If he sent) few sivlonot, such that they would be used in the house of her (the bride’s) father’s house, they are not collected.", 
        "One on his deathbed who wrote all of his property to others and left any land (for himself), his gift stands (even if he recovers).  If he did not leave any land, his gift does not stand.  If he did not write in it (that he was on his) deathbed, he says he was on his deathbed, and they say he was healthy (so his gifts will stand), he has to bring proof that he was on his deathbed according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, the one who removes from his friend, the (burden of) proof is on him (they have to prove he was healthy).", 
        "One who divides his property orally, Rabi Eliezer says, whether healthy or dangerous (gravely ill), property which has responsibility (which can be mortgaged) is acquired with money, a document, and grasping, and (property) which does not have responsibility is not acquired other than with pulling.  They said to him there was a case with the mother of the sons of Rochel who was sick (the mother), and she said, give my brooch to my daughter, it is (worth) twelve maneh, she died, and they fulfilled her words.  He said to them, the sons of Rochel, their mother should bury them (they were wicked, so we cannot prove from their deeds).  Chachamim say, on Shabbat his words stand because he cannot write, but not on a weekday.  Rabi Yehoshua says, on Shabbat they said, it is a kal vechomer on a weekday (because it has the potential to be acquired on a weekday, it does not actually need it).  Similarly, one may merit for minor (for he cannot acquire things himself) and one may not merit for an adult (for he can acquire things himself).  Rabi Yehoshua says, they said it for a minor, kal vechomer for an adult.", 
        "If a house fell on him and his father, or on him and on his heirs (killing them), and there was (obligation for) a ktuba of a woman and a creditor, the heirs of the father say, the son dies first, and then the father died (so the son does not have a piece of the inheritance), and the creditors say, the father died first and then the son died (for they will collect from his piece).  Beit Shamay says, they split, and Beit Hillel says, the property is presumed (to stay with the heirs, for those who remove from them bear the burden of proof).", 
        "If a house fell on him and his wife, the heirs of the husband say, the woman died first and then the husband died (so he will not have to pay a ktuba, and the heirs of the woman say, the husband died first, and then the woman died.  Beit Shamay says, they split, an Beit Hillel says, the property is presumed, the ktuba is is grasped by the heirs of the father, and the property which enters and leaves (the marriage) with he, is grasped by the heirs of the father.", 
        "If a house fell on him and his mother, this and that (Beit Shamay and Beit Hillel) agree that they split (for both sides have inheritance).  Rabi Akiva said, I admit that here the property is in their grasp (of the mother’s heirs).  Ben Azay said to him, we are unhappy about their disagreements, (and) rather you came to disagree on the equal (when they agree)?"
