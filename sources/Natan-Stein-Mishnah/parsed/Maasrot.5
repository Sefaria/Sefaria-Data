        "One who uproots seedlings from his own (property) and plants them among his own, he is patur.  If he bought something attached to the ground, it’s patur.  If he bought something to give to his friend, it’s patur.  Rabi Elazar ben Azariah says, if something like them is sold in the shuk, it is chayav (it is seemingly a marketable product).", 
        "One who uproots turnip or radishes from his (property) and plants it in his own for the seed, it’s chayav, because that is considered its ‘threshing floor.’  Onions, once they take root in the upper story (where they are stored) they become tahor if they were tame.  Or if debris fell on them and they got uncovered, they are as if planted in the field.", 
        "Once the season of ma’aser comes, one may not sell produce to someone who isn’t trusted by ma’asrot, and not shvi’it (produce) to one who is suspected about shvi’it.  But if some ripened, he may take the ripe and sell the rest freely.", 
        "One may not sell his hay, olive-peat, or grape residue to one who isn’t trusted by ma’asrot so that he can juice them.  If he juiced them, he’s chayav by ma’asrot but patur by trumot, for one who sets aside truma has in mind the broken bits, the sides, and what is inside the hay (to have trumot taken from it).", 
        "One who buys a vegetable field in Syria, if it’s not yet the season of ma’asrot, he’ll be chayav.  But if the season of ma’asrot has arrived, it’s patur, and he may continue gathering as usual.  Rabi Yehuda says, he may even hire laborers to harvest.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what is this talking about?  When he acquired land, for if the season of ma’asrot didn’t come he’s patur.  Rabi says, (he must take ma’asrot) even according to calculation (of what grew when the field was his).", 
        "One who made wine from grape residue and put in a certain measure of water, and found the same measure (of wine as he had put in water) he’s patur.  Rabi Yehuda says you’re chayav.  If he found more than the water he put in, if he takes for it from somewhere else, he takes for the calculated increase.", 
        "Ant hills which stayed an entire night next to a pile (of grain) which was chayav, they are chayav, for it is known that they dragged the whole night from completed produce.", 
        "Ba’al Bechi garlic, Richpa onions, Sicilian barley, and Egyptian lentils, Rabi Meir says, even the root of the Egyptian bean, Rabi Yossi says, even wild lentils, are patur from ma’asrot (since they are definitely from outside Israel), and may bought from anyone on shvi’it.  The upper seeds of luf, the seeds of leeks, the seeds of onions, the seeds of turnip and radish, and other garden seeds which aren’t eaten are patur from ma’asrot and can be bought from anyone on shvi’it, for even if their plant was truma, they may be eaten."
