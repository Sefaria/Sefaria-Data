        "One who deposits by his friend an animal or vessels and they were stolen or got lost, if he paid and didn’t want to swear (that he wasn’t negligent), for behold they said, an unpaid guardian swears and exits (without paying).  If the thief was found, he pays the restitution of kefel, if he slaughtered or sold, he pays the restitution of four or five.  To whom does he pay?  To he who the deposit (the loss) is by him (the guardian).  If he (the guardian) swore and didn’t want to pay, the thief was found, he pays the restitution of kefel, and if he slaughtered or sold he pays the restitution of four or five.  To whom does he pay?  To the (original) owner of the deposit.", 
        "One who rents a cow from his friend and he lent it to another, and it died in its normal fashion, the renter swears that it died in its normal fashion, and the borrower pays the renter.  Rabi Yossi said, how does this one make a profit with the cow of his friend?  Rather he returns the cow to the owners.", 
        "If he said to two, I stole a maneh from one of you, and I do not know which one of you, or, the father of one of you deposited by me a maneh, and I don’t know which one it is, he gives this one a maneh and that one a maneh, for he admitted from his own mouth.", 
        "Two who deposited by one, this one a maneh and that one two hundred (zuz), this one says, the two hundred was mine and that one says, the two hundred was mine, he gives this one a maneh and that one a maneh and the remainder will be left until Eliyahu comes.  Rabi Yossi said, if so, what did the cheater lose?  Rather, all of it is left until Eliyahu comes.", 
        "And so too two vessels, one is worth a maneh and one is worth a thousand zuz, this one says, the nicer is mine, and that one says, the nicer is mine, he gives the smaller to one of them, and from (sale of) the nicer he gives the money of the smaller to the other, and the rest is left until Eliyahu comes.  Rabi Yossi said, if so, what did the cheater lose?  Rather, everything is left until Eliyahu comes.", 
        "One who deposits by his friend, even if they are getting lost (wasting away) he may not touch them (sell them).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, they sell before a court, because it is like he is returning something lost to the owners.", 
        "One who deposits produce by his friend (but is not sure how much to return), behold he may take from him losses (what is usually lost from produce).  For wehat and for rice (the amount lost is) nine half kabin for every kor, for barley and millet nine kabin for every kor, and for spelt and flaxseed three se’ah per kor, all is according to the measure (of grain) and all is according to the time (it is left with the guardian).  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri said, and what does it matter to the mice, don’t they eat from a lot (of food) and from a little?  Rather, he only takes out his losses from one kor alone.  Rabi Yehuda says, if it was a large measure, he does not take out his losses because it increases (for the grain is usually deposited when it will be dry and collected at a time it will be wet, so the volume increases).  ", 
        "He may take out from him one sixth for wine (which was deposited but mixed with the guardian’s wine).  Rabi Yehuda says, a fifth.  He may take from him three log of oil from one hundred (if it was mixed), a log and a half for sediment (for that sinks to the bottom and is unusable) and a log and a half for absorption (by the barrels).  If it was refined oil, he may not take from him for sediment, and if the jars were old, he does not take for absorption.  Rabi Yehuda says, also one who sells refined oil to his friend the whole year, behold this one (accepts that he) gets one and a half of sediment for hundred.", 
        "One who deposits a barrel by his friend, the owners did not have a special place for it, and he moved it and it broke, if because of his hand (moving it) it broke and (he moved it) for his own need, he’s chayav.  If for it’s needs (for the good of the barrel), he’s patur.  If after he put it down it broke, whether (he moved it) for his needs or for its needs, he’s patur.  If the owners had a special place for it, and he moved it and it broke, whether in his hand or from when he put it down (if he moved it) for his needs, he’s chayva, but if for its needs, he’s patur.", 
        "If he deposited money by his friend, if he tied them and carried them over his back, gave them to his minor son or daughter, or locked before it improperly, he’s chayav, for it is not the way of the guardians.  But if he guarded them like the way of the guardians, he is patur.", 
        "One who deposits money by a moneychanger, if they are bound, he may not use them, therefore, if they got lost, he is not chayav in their responsibility (to replace them).  If they are unbound, he may use them, and therefore if they got lost, he is chayav in their responsibility.  If (he deposited) by the homeowner, whether bound or unbound, he may not use them, therefore if they got lost, he is not chayav in their responsibility.  A storekeeper is like a homeowner according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, the storekeeper is like a moneychanger.", 
        "One who sends a hand (uses) a deposit, Beit Shamay says, he suffers its diminishment and appreciation (owes the owner whatever the change in value was).  Beit Hillel says, (he owes) like the time of taking (he always owes the original value).  Rabi Akiva says, like the time of its claim (by the one who deposited it, meaning he gets whatever it is now).  One who considers sending a hand on a deposit, Beit Shamay says, he’s chayav.  Beit Hillel says, he’s not chayav until he sends a hand in it, as it says, “if he did not send his hand in the work of his friend.”  How?  He tipped the barrel and took a revi’it from it, but it broke, he only pays a revi’it.  If the raised it (an act of acquisition) and took a revi’it from it and it broke, he pays the value of all of it."
