        "The megilla is read on the eleventh, the twelfth, the thirteenth, the fourteenth, or the fifteenth (of Adar), no more and no less.  Cities surrounded by a wall from the days of Yehoshua ben Nun read on the fifteenth.  Towns and large cities read on the fourteenth, but the villages advance it to the day of gathering (a Monday or Thursday when they would go to sell in the large cities).", 
        "How?  If the fourteenth fell out on a Monday, the villages and large cities read that day and (cities) surrounded by walls read the next day.  If it fell out on a Tuesday or Wednesday the villages would advance to the day of gathering, the large cities read that day, and surrounded by walls read the next day.  If it fell out on Thursday, villages and large cities read that day, and surrounded by walls read the next day.  If it fell out on Friday, the villages advance to the day of gathering and the large cities and surrounded by walls read that day.  If it fell out on Shabbat, villages and large cities advance and read on the day of gathering and surrounded by walls the next day.  If it fell out on Sunday, villages advance to the day of gathering, large cities read that day, and surrounded by walls read the next day.", 
        "What is a large city?  Any which has ten people of leisure (who do not work and who will always be in shul).  Less than thus behold it is a village.  In these (times for reading) they said they advance but do not postpone.  But the time of the wood for the kohanim, Tisha B’Av, the chagiga (offering), and hakhel (the king reading on Sukkot of shvi’it) they postpone and do not advance (if it falls out on Shabbat).  Even though they said you advance and do not postpone, it is permitted (to have) a eulogy and a fast (on a day to which they postponed the megilla) and gifts to the poor.  Rabi Yehuda says, when?  In a place where they gather on Monday and Thursday, but in a place where they do not gather on a Monday or a Thursday, they only read in its time.", 
        "If they read megilla in the first Adar and the year was made a leap year (adding a second Adar) they read it in Adar II.  There is nothing between Adar I and Adar II other than reading the Megilla and the gifts for the poor (which are only valid in Adar II).", 
        "There is nothing between Yom Tov and Shabbat other than food for people.  There is nothing between (the punishments) for Shabbat and Yom Hakippurim, except that this one his intentional sin is (punished) in the hands of man, and this one his intentional sin is in the hands of karet.", 
        "There is nothing between one who takes a vow against pleasure from his fried and one who swears on him against food except for the treading of the foot (being allowed through one’s courtyard) and vessels with which he does not make food for a person.  There is nothing between vow offerings and donations except that vow offerings are chayav on their responsibility (to replace them if necessary) and in donations he is not chayav on their responsibility.", 
        "There is nothing between a zav (person who sees a problematic discharge) who sees two (discharges) and one who sees three (which takes on a higher level of being a zav) except a korban (an additional korban on the eight day).  There is nothing between a metzora (on who is stricken with the divine skin disease of tzara’at, usually translated as leprosy, though that does not fit the symptoms) who is quarantined (to see if the disease reaches a sufficient stage to be considered tzara’at) and a metzora who was declared (to have it for sure) except neglecting the hair and tearing the clothes.  There is nothing between a tahor (clean from tzara’at) quarantined and a tahor declared except shaving and birds (brought as a korban).", 
        "There is nothing between books (of the tanach) and tfillin and mezuzot except that the books may be written in (translated into) any language and tfillin and mezuzot may only be written in Ashurit (Hebrew).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, even the books were only allowed to be written in Greek.", 
        "There is nothing between a kohen (gadol) who is (initiated by being) anointed and a kohen who is increased in garments (after the anointment oil was hidden, they would signify initiation by wearing the additional garments of the kohen gadol) except for the bull which comes for all of the mitzvot (if the kohen gadol who was anointed sins, he brings a special bull).  There is nothing between a substitute kohen (gadol) and a kohen who passed (from the post if he was found to be unfit for a time, he was given a replacement for while he became fit) except the bull of Yom Hakippurim (only the normal kohen gadol offers it) and the tenth of the epha (of fine flour is offered every day, but only by the normal kohen gadol).", 
        "There is nothing between Shilo (where the mishkan was) and Yerushalayim except that in Shilo one eats lightly holy things (certain sacrifices are classified as such) and ma’aser sheni in all (places which) see (Shilo), and in Yerushalayim it is (only allowed) inside the wall.  And in both places the holiest of holies are eaten only in the enclosures (mishkan or Beit Hamikdash).  The holiness of Shilo, after it (leaves) there is permission (to use private altars) and Yerushalayim, there is no permission."
