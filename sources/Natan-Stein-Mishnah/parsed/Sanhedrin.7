        "Four kinds of death were given to the stoning, burning, killing, and strangling.  Rabi Shimon says (the order of severity was), burning, stoning, strangling, killing.  We have already seen the commanded way of stoning.", 
        "The commanded way of they would put him in manure up to his knees and they would put hard scarf into a soft one and twist it around his neck.  They would pull the scarf on either side until he opens his mouth, and they would light the lead bar and throw it into his mouth, and it would go into his bowels and scorch the organs.  Rabi Yehuda says, if they killed him like this, they didn’t fulfill the commanded way of burning, rather they open his mouth with tongs against his will, they light the bar, throw it into his mouth, and it goes into his bowels and scorches the organs.  Rabi Elazar ben Tzadok said, once the daughter of a kohen committed adultery, and they encircled her with bundles of branches and burned her.  They said to him, this court was not at that time one of experts.", 
        "The commanded way of they would cut his head with a sword, the way the government does.  Rabi Yehuda says, this is a disgrace, rather they rest his head on a block and cut it with a hatchet.  They said to him there is no more disgraceful death than what you said (it resembles cutting an animal).  The commanded way of they put him in manure up to his knees, they put a hard scarf into a soft one, wind it on his neck, and pull on either side until he dies.", 
        "These people are one who has sex with his wife, his father’s wife, his daughter-in-law, a man, an animal (man or woman), the blasphemer, idolater, one who sacrifices his child to Molech, a necromancer, a soothsayer, one who desecrates Shabbat, one who curses his parents, one who has sex with an betrothed woman, the enticer to idolatry, the misleader of the masses, the sorcerer, and a rebellious son.  One who has sex with his mother if chayav based on both his mother and his father’s wife.  Rabi Yehuda says, only because of his mother.  One who has sex with his father’s mother is chayav based on his father’s wife and a married woman, whether his father is dead or alive or if they are betrothed or married.  One who has sex with a man or an animal, male or female, If he sinned, did the animal sin (i.e. why is it put to death)?  Rather, because the man came to sin through it, therefore the pasuk says to stone them.  Another idea, such that the animal won’t come to be for sale, and people will say this is the animal that caused so and so to be stoned.", 
        "The blasphemer isn’t accountable until he says the holy Name.  Rabi Yehoshua ben Korcha says, when they interrogate the witnesses, they use a substitute name, “Yossi will smite Yossi.”  When the judgment is concluded, they do not kill with a substitute name, rather they send out everyone and ask the greatest of the witnesses, say exactly what you heard.  And he says, and the judges stand up and tear their clothes and never mend them.  The second witness comes in and says, I heard as he did, and so too with the third.", 
        "The idolater, one who worships, sacrifices, burns incense, pours libations, bows, accepts as a god, or says to it, you are a god for me.  But one who hugs, kisses, honors with sweeping, sprinkles water before, washes, “anoints”, dresses, or puts shoes on, transgresses a lo ta’ase.  One who makes a vow in its name or makes an act in its name transgresses a lo ta’ase.  One who relieves himself before Ba’al-Pe’or, this is the manner of worshipping it.  One who throws a stone to Markulis (Mercury), this is the manner of worshipping it.", 
        "One who gives his child to Molech isn’t chayav until he gives himself over to Molech and passes through the fire.  He gave to Molech but did not pass through the fire or passed through the fire but did not give over, isn’t chayav, until he does both.  A necromancer is a sorcerer who speaks from his armpit, and a soothsayer is a sorcerer who speaks with his mouth.  Behold these are killed by stoning and one who asks from them is forewarned.", 
        "One who desecrates Shabbat, something which if done intentionally is punished by excision and if done intentionally is punished by a korban chatat.  One who curses his parents, isn’t chayav until he curses with the holy Name.  If he cursed with a substitute name, Rabi Meir says chayav and Chachamim say patur.", 
        "One who has sex with a betrothed woman isn’t chayav unless she is a young virgin betrothed in her father’s house.  If two had sex with her, the first is stoned and the second is strangled.", 
        "The enticer, this is a layman who entices a layman (to idolatry).  He says to him, there is fear of an idol in such and such a place, thus it feeds, thus it gives drinks, thus it does good, and thus it does bad.  One does not set up a sting for any death given by the torah except for this.  He said to two, and they are the witnesses, so they bring him to court and stone him.  He said to one, the one will say, I have friends who want something like this.  If he is subtle, and will only talk to one, they hide witnesses behind the fence, and the first witness says, tell me what you said in private.  Then he says it, and the witness says, how can leave Hashem and go serve trees and stones?  If he retracts, this is good (enough to not bring him to court).  But if he said, this is our duty and it is nice for us, the witnesses behind the fence take him to court and stone him.  If a person says I will worship, sacrifice, bring incense, bring libations, or bow; or I will go worship, sacrifice, bring incense, bring libations, or bow; or we will go worship, sacrifice, bring incense, bring libations, or bow, this is an enticer.  One that leads astray is one who says, let’s go and worship avoda zara.", 
        "Yud A sorcerer is one who does a liable act, and not one who does slight of hand.  Rabi Akiva says in the name of Rabi Yehoshua, two who gather squash, one is patur and one is chayav.  The one who gathered through sorcery is chayav, and the one who ‘gathered’ by slight of hand is patur."
