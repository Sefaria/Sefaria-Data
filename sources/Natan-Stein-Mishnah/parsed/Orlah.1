        "One who plants for a fence of beams is patur from orla (a prohibition of eating the first three years of fruit from any tree).  Rabi Yossi says, even if he says, the inner side is for eating and the outer is for a fence, the inner is chayav and the outer is patur.", 
        "In the time when our forefathers came to the land, if they found planted, it’s patur.  If they planted, even though they had not conquered (the land), it’s chayav.  One who plants for the masses, it’s chayav, Rabi Yehuda says it’s patur.  One who plants in a public place, a non-Jew who plants, a robber who plants, one who plants on a boat, or a tree which grew on its own, is chayav by orla.", 
        "A tree (that isn’t chayav orla) that was uprooted with a rock (a clump of earth around its roots), or a river washed it away with a rock, if it could live, it’s patur, and if it couldn’t live, it’s chayav.  If a rock was removed from its side, the plow shook it, or it was shaken and made like the earth, if it could live, it’s patur, and if not, it’s chayav.", 
        "A tree which was uprooted and it kept a root is patur.  And how much is considered a root?  Raban Gamliel says in the name of Rabi Elazar ben Yehuda a person from Bartota, like a needle used for stretching.", 
        "A tree which was uprooted and it has a runner which it lives off of, the old part returned to be like the runner (now chayav in orla).  He made runners year after year, and the original runner (in the line of runners) became detached, he counts from the time it became detached.  Engrafting grapes, and an engraftment upon an engraftment, even though the runner is in the earth, is allowed (patur from orla, since it still draws nourishment from the parent plant). Rabi Meir says, in a place where its strength (the parent vine’s nourishment) is good, it’s mutar, but where it’s bad, it’s assur.  So too with a runner which detached and is full of fruit, if it creased by one two-hundredth (from the ground and not the parent plant) it’s assur.", 
        "A shoot of orla or vineyard kilayim which mixed up with shoots, this may not be gathered.  And if he gathered, it becomes nullified in two hundred to one, as long as he doesn’t mean to gather it (the forbidden was gathered accidentally).  Rabi Yossi says, even if he intended to gather it, it is nullified by one in two hundred.", 
        "The leaves, fronds, saps, and buds are allowed from a perspective of orla and revai and to a nazir, and are forbidden by an ashera.  Rabi Yossi says, the buds are assur, since it is a fruit.  Rabi Eliezer says, if one curdles milk with the sap of an orla, it’s assur.  Rabi Yehoshua said, I heard explicitly that if one curdles milk with the sap of the leaves or roots, it’s mutar, but the sap of unripe fruit, it’s assur, since it’s fruit.", 
        "Defective grapes, kernels, husks, and wine made from them pomegranate skin and its sprout, nutshells, and seeds are assur in orla, ashera, and to a nazir, but are mutar in revai.  And unripe fruit is assur in all.", 
        "Rabi Yossi says, one may plant a shoot of orla, but one does not plant a nut of orla, since it is a fruit.  And one may not graft early date-berries of orla."
