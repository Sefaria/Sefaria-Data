        "One who hires artisans, and they deceived one another (if one is working as a contractor and he offers less than what the one hiring offered and pockets the difference) they have nothing on one another except resentment.  If he hired a donkey driver or a potter to bring carriers and flutists for a bride (wedding) or a dead person (funeral), workers to take out his flax from soaking, and anything which will be lost (with time), and they returned from them (retracted), in a place where there is no person he may hire (others) on them (at their expense, for they defaulted) or he may deceive them (the original workers by promising higher wages but not following through).", 
        "One who hires artisans and they returned from them (retracted), their hand is on the bottom (they have the disadvantage, meaning he subtracts from their wage whatever he had to pay to complete the job).  If the homeowner returns on it, his hand is on the bottom.  Whoever changes (the terms) his hand is on the bottom, and whoever returns on it, his hand is on the bottom.", 
        "One who rents a donkey to lead it in the mountain and led it in the valley, (or rented it to walk) in the valley and led it on the mountain, even if this is ten mil (of walking) and that is ten mil, and it died, he is chayav (for even though it was the same distance he violated the terms of use).  One who rents a donkey and it got blinded or it was seized for public service, he says to him, behold what is yours is before you.  If it died or broke (was injured) he is obligated to stand up for him a donkey (replace it).  One who rents a donkey to lead it on the mountain and he led it in the valley and it slipped, he is patur (for the one who rented to him for the mountain assumed a risk of slipping), but if it overheated (which was not assumed with the mountain), he’s chayav.  (If he rented it) to lead it in the valley and he led it on the mountain, if it slipped, he’s chayav, but if it overheated, he’s patur, if as a result of the ascent, he’s chayav.", 
        "One who rented a cow to plow on the mountain and plowed in the valley, if the blade of the plow broke, he’s patur (for it breaks more easily on a mountain).  (If he rented to plow) in the valley and plowed on the mountain, if the blade of the plow broke, he’s chayav.  To thresh legumes and he threshed grain, he’s patur, to thresh grain and he threshed legumes, he’s chayav because legumes are slippery.  ", 
        "One who rents a donkey to bring on it (load it with) wheat and he brought barley on it, he’s chayav (if something happens to the donkey for even if the weights are the same, the volumes are different).  (If he rented it to carry) produce but he brought hay on it, he’s chayav, because the volume is hard to load.  To bring a letech (a volume equal to half a kor) of wheat and brought a letech of barley (which is less dense), he’s patur.  And if he adds on its burden, he is chayav.  And how much must he add on his burden to be chayav?  Sumchus says in the name of Rabi Meir, a se’ah for a camel and three kabin for a donkey.", 
        "All artisans (who have something in their care) are (equivalent) to paid guardians.  And all (artisans) who said, take what is yours and bring money, (are like an) unpaid guardian.  (If one says,) guard for me (now) and I will guard for you (later), (he is considered) a paid guardian.  (If one says,) guard for me, and he (the guardian) said to him, put it down before me, (he is considered) an unpaid guardian.", 
        "If one lent him on collateral (the lender is considered) a paid guardian (in matters of the collateral).  Rabi Yehuda says, if he lent him money, he is an unpaid guardian, if he lent him produce he is a paid guardian.  Abba Shaul says, a person is allowed to rent the collateral of a poor person set a price and go (using this money to reduce the debt), for he is like one who returns a lost article.", 
        "One who moves a barrel from place to place and it broke, whether he is an unpaid guardian or a paid guardian, he must swear (that he was not acting negligently).  Rabi Eliezer says, this and that (both) swear, but I wonder if this and that may swear (for the paid guardian should really be paying for it)."
