        "One may clear out even four or five piles of hay and produce because of guests and because of neglect of the beit midrash (to clear space for the students), but not the (entire) storehouse (for he may be flattening the floor).  One may clear out tahor truma, dmai, ma’aser rishon which had truma taken, ma’aser sheni and hekdesh which were redeemed, and dry lupine, because it is food for the poor.  But not tevel, ma’aser rishon from which truma wasn’t taken, ma’aser sheni and hekdesh which weren’t redeemed, luf, and not mustard.

And all of the needs of a brit mila may be done on Shabbat."
