Aleph: Raban Gamliel says (in cases where two wives of one brother who died come to their brother and law), there is no (validity to a second) get after (he already gave) a get, no contractual marriage after a contractual marriage, no relations after relations, and no chalitza after chalitza.  And Chachamim say, there is a get after a get, and contractual marriage after contractual marriage, but no relations after relations and no chalitza after chalitza.
Bet: How?  If he made a contractual marriage for his sister-in-law and gave her a get, she needs chalitza from him (for he still needs to do yibum).  If he made a contractual marriage and chalitza, she needs a get from him.  If he made a contractual marriage and consummated, behold, this is like the mitzva.
Gimmel: If he gave a get and made a contractual marriage, she needs a get (the first one was meaningless) and chalitza.  If he gave a get and consummated, she needs a get and chalitza.  If he gave a get and did chalitza, there is nothing after chalitza.  If he did chalitza, made a contractual marriage, gave a get, and had relations, or had relations, made a contractual marriage, gave a get, and did chalitza, there is nothing after chalitza.  (This applies) whether it is one yevama (sister-in-law) to one yavam (living brother) or two Yevamot to one yavam.
Daled: How?  He made a contractual marriage for this one, and a contractual marriage for that one, they need two gittin and (one needs) chalitza.  A contractual marriage for this one and a get for that, she (the one married) needs a get and chalitza.  A contractual marriage for this one and relations, they need two gittin and (the one he had relations with needs) chalitza.  A contractual marriage for this, and chalitza for that, the first needs a get.  A get for this one and a get for that, they (each) need from him chalitza.  A get for this and relations for that, she (the one who he had relations with) needs a get and chalitza.  Get for this and a contractual marriage for that, she (the one who got a contractual marriage) needs a get and (one of them needs) chalitza.  A get for this and did chalitza for that, there is nothing (needed, and therefore valid) after chalitza.
Hay: He did chalitza and did chalitza or did chalitza and made a contractual marriage, gave a get and had relations, or he had relations and had relations, had relations and made a contractual marriage, gave a get and did chalitza, there is nothing after chalitza.  (These apply) whether one yavam for two yevamot or two yevamin or one yevama.
Vav: He did chalitza, a contractual marriage, gave a get, and had relations or had relations, made a contractual marriage, gave a get, and did chalitza, there is nothing after chalitza, whether at the beginning, the middle, or the end.  And he had relations with her, when it is at the beginning, there is nothing (necessary even for another yevama) after it.  If itâ€™s in the middle or at the end, there is something after it (the relations were inappropriate, and therefore she still requires chalitza).  Rabi Nechemia says, whether relations or chalitza, whether at the beginning, middle, or end, there is nothing after them.
