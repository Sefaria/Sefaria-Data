Aleph: Partners (in owning a courtyard) who vowed against benefiting from each other are prohibited from entering the courtyard.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, each may enter his part.  And both of them are forbidden from setting up a millstone or oven there and from raising chickens there (things the other has the legal right to object to).  If one of them vowed against benefit from his friend, he may not enter the courtyard.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, he can say to him, I enter into mine, and I don’t enter into yours.  And they force the one who swears to sell his field.
Bet: If one from the shuk (a random other person) vowed against benefit from one of them, he may not enter the courtyard.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, he can say to him (the won he is vowed against) I am entering into your friend’s, I will not enter into yours.
Gimmel: One who vowed against pleasure from his friend and he has a rented bathhouse or olive press in the city, if he (the one who he vowed against) has ownership in them, he (the one who vowed) is assur (from deriving benefit from them).  If he doesn’t have ownership in them, he is mutar.  One who says to his friend, konam that I will enter your house and (konam) you field that I (may) buy, if he (the one who he vowed against) died or sold it (the house or the field) to another, he is mutar.  Konam to this house that I enter, to this field that I buy, if he died or sold it to another, assur.
Daled: (If one says to his friend) behold I am cherem upon you, the one who is vowed on is (the friend) assur (from deriving benefit of the maker of the statement).  Behold you are cherem upon me, assur.  Behold I am (cherem) one you and you on me, they are both assur.  And they are both mutar in things of the returnees from Bavel (infrastructure set up in that time to be used by all Jews), and assur in a thing of that city (since they both have rights in it).
Hay: And what is a thing of the returnees from Bavel?  For example the temple mount and its courtyards and a (certain) well in the middle of the road.  And what is something of that city?  For example, the open space (used for town meetings), the bathhouse, the shul, the aron kodesh (for the torahs), and the books.  And the one who writes (off) his part for the nasi (leader, this is a loophole for people who vow against benefit from others).  Rabi Yehuda says, whether he writes it to the nasi or to a layman.  What is the difference between writing to the nasi and writing to a layman?  That one who writes to the nasi does not need to merit it (unlike a layman, the nasi can acquire without making an act of acquisition).  Chachamim say, both need to merit, they only spoke of the nasi because of the present (the prevalent case in the present).  Rabi Yehuda says, the people of the Galil do not need to write, for their forefathers already wrote for them (that common property belongs to the nasi).
Vav: One who vowed against benefiting from his friend and has nothing to eat, he (the one vowed against) gives to another as a gift and that one is mutar in it.  There was a case with one in Beit Choron whose father was vowed against benefit from him, and (the son) he was marrying off his son, and he said to his friend, behold, the courtyard and the meal are given to you as a gift, and they aren’t before you except so that my father can come and eat a meal with us. He said to him, if they are mine, behold they are hekdesh for heaven.  He said to him, I didn’t give you mine such that you should make them hekdesh for heaven.  He said to him, you only gave me yours so that you and your father would eat and drink, and like one another, and there will be sin hung on his head (he will end up breaking his vow).  And when the thing came before the Chachamim they said, any gift which is not (intended as such) if he made it hekdesh, it isn’t hekdesh, it isn’t a gift.
