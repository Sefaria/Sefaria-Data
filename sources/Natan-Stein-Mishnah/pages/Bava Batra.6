Aleph: One who sells produce to his friend (who did not specify if they are to be eaten or sown) and they did not sprout, even flaxseed (which was generally sown), he is not obligated in their responsibility (to refund him).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, seeds of a garden which are not eaten, his is obligated in their responsibility.
Bet: One who sells produce to his friend, he (the buyer) accepts upon himself a rova of refuse per se’ah.  (If he buys) dates, he accepts upon him self ten wormy ones per hundred, a cellar of wine, he accepts upon himself ten sourish ones per hundred, and jars in the Sharon, he accepts upon himself ten brittle ones per hundred.
Gimmel: One who sells wine to his friend and it turns, he is not obligated in its responsibility, but if it is known that his wine is turning, behold this is a sale in error.  If he (the seller) said to him, I am selling you mulled wine, he is chayav to uphold it until Shavuot (if the wine turns before then, the seller must replace it).  And old (wine) from last year, and aged, from three years (ago).
Daled: One who sells space to his friend to build a house, and so too one who receives from his friend to build for him a wedding house for his son or a widow’s house for his daughter (a place for her to live after being widowed), he builds four amot by six, according to Rabi Akiva.  Rabi Yishma’el says, this is a barn for cattle (dairy), one who wants to make a dairy builds four amot by six, a small house is six by eight, a large is eight by ten, and a hall is ten by ten.  Its height is like half of its length and like half of its width.  A proof for the thing is the sanctuary (of the Beit Hamikdash).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, all is like the building of the sanctuary.
Hay: One who had a hole inside his friend’s house enters at a time when it is the way of people to enter and leaves at a time when it is the way of people to leave.  And he may not enter his animal and let it drink from his hole, rather he fills (a vessel) and lets it drink outside.  And this one (the owner of the hole) makes him a lock (so the homeowner does not steal from it), and that one (the homeowner) makes him a lock (so he cannot just come in whenever he wants).
Vav: One who had a garden within his friend’s garden enters at a time when it is the way of people to enter and leaves at a time that it is the way of people to leave.  He may not bring in merchants, and he may not enter it from another field (he may only go the path designated for him).  And the outer one (main owner) may sow the path (he does not have to leave it for the other).  If they (a court) gave him a path on the side (of the outer garden, but not through it) with the knowledge of both of them, he may enter at the time he wishes and leave at the time he wishes, he may bring merchants into it, he may not enter from a different field, and this and that (neither) do not have the right to sow it.
Zayin: One who a public path passed through his field, and he took it and gave them (a different path) from the side, what he gave he gave, but his (what he took) did not reach him.  A private path (rights given to one to cut through another’s field), is four amot (wide at a minimum).  A public path is sixteen amot, the road of the king has no measurement, and the road of the grave (a path traveled by a funeral party) had no measurement.  A place to stand (clearing sold to someone else) the judges of Tzippori said, it is the space of four kabin.
Chet: One who sells space to his friend for him to make a grave, and so too one who receives from his friend to make a grave, makes the inside of the cave (crypt) four amot by six, and opens into it eight cavities (for bodies) three from here (one six amah side), three from there (the other side) and two opposite them (the entrance on a four amah side).  And the cavities, their length is four amot, their height is seven (tfachim) and their width is six (tfachim).  Rabi Shimon says, he makes the inside of the crypt six amot by eight, and opens in it thirteen cavities, four from here (on one eight amah side), four from there, three opposite (the entrance), one to the right of the entrance, and one on the right of the entrance.  And he makes a courtyard to at the mouth of the crypt six (amot) by six, to fit the coffin and its relatives, and he opens into it (the courtyard, up to) two crypts, one from here (one side) and one from there (opposite).  Rabi Shimon says, four, in the four directions.  Rabin Shimon ben Gamliel says, all is according to the rock (whether it is sotf or hard determines the size and number of crypts).
