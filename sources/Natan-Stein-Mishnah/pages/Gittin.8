Aleph: One who throws a get to his wife and she is in her house or in her courtyard, behold she is divorced.  If he threw it to her inside his house, or inside his courtyard, even if he is with her in bed, she is not married.  (If he threw it) into her breast (on her) or in her possession, behold she is divorced.
Bet: If he said to her, take this bill of debt, or if she finds it (the get) behind him, and she reads it and behold it is her get, it is not a get, until he tells her, this is your get.  If he put it in her hand but she is sleeping (and) she wakes up, reads it, and behold it is her get, it is not her get until he tells her, this is your get.  If she was standing in the public domain and he threw it to her, if it is closer to her, she is divorced, if closer to him, she is not divorced.  Half by half (exactly in the middle), she is divorced and not divorced.
Gimmel: And so too for the issue of engagement.  And so too for the issue of debts, if his creditor said to him, throw me my debt, and he threw it to him, if it is closer to the lender, the borrower merited in it.  If it was closer to the borrower, the borrower is (still) chayav (to pay the loan).  Half on half, (exactly in between), the two of them split it. If she was standing on top of a roof, and he threw it to her (the get), since it got to the air of the roof, behold she is divorced.  If he is on top and she is on bottom, and he threw it to her, since it went out from the domain of the roof, (even) if it was erased or burned, behold she is divorced.
Daled: Beit Shamay says, he may exempt (divorce) his wife with an old get, and Beit Hillel forbid.  What is an old get?  All which he was alone with her since its writing for her.
Hay: If he wrote (the date on) it in the name of (using the years of a king) a government which isn’t honest (referring to Rome), the name of the government of Madai, the name of the government of Greece, (in the name of) the building of the Beit Hamikdash, or the destruction of the Beit Hamikdash, (or if) he was in the east and wrote, in the west, or was in the best and wrote, in the east, (and she remarried), she exits this and that (marriage), she needs a get from this and that, she does not get a ktuba, fruits (payment for what the husband gained from her nichsei tzon barzel), no maintenance, and no depreciation (payment for wear to nichsel melog), not from this one or that.  If she took from this or that, she must return.  And the offspring is a mamzer from this and that. And neither this one nor that one become tame for her (if they are kohanim), and this one and that do not have a right in her findings, the work of her hands (the things she produces), or in annulling her vows.  If she was a bat yisra’el, she is pasul from (marrying into) the kehuna, a bet levi from ma’aser, and a bat kohen from truma (for no male is giving them these things).  And the heirs of this and the heirs of that do not inherit her ktuba.  And if they died, the brother of this one and the brother of that one do chalitza (for the wife) but not yibum.  If he changed his name or her name, the name of his town or the name of her town, she exits from this and that and all of these things are (done) with her.
Vav: All inappropriate relations (relatives who exempt their rivals from yibum and chalitza) who said, their rivals are permitted (to marry), these rival went and married.  These (the relatives) were found ayloniyot (barren, meaning the marriage was void, and the rivals did in fact need yibum or chalitza), she (the rival) exits from this and that, and all of these ways (in which we remove her rights) areupon her.
Zayin: One who marries his yevama (freeing her rival) and her rival went and married, and this one, (the original) was found to be n aylonit (meaning the rival had no right to marry another man), she (the rival) must leave this one and that one, and all of there ways are upon her.
Chet: A scribe wrote a get for a woman and a receipt (which she gives to her husband when she receives her ktuba) for a woman, and he made a mistake and gave the get to the woman and the receipt to the man (even though he should have done the opposite so the woman and the man could exchange).  They gave (the documents) to each other (thinking they were the proper documents), and after some time (during which she remarried) behold (they discover) that the get come out of the hand of the man (he has the get) and the receipt comes out of the hand of the woman (she has the receipt), she exits from this and that (leaves both marriages), and all of these ways (the punishments mentioned before) are upon her.  Rabi Eliezer says, if it comes out immediately (before she’s married), this is not a get, if (it comes out) after time, behold it is a get, we do not give the first (husband) power to lose the right of the second (to be married to her).  If he wrote to divorce his wife and changed his mind, Beit Shamay says, he made her pasul from kohanim, and Beit Hillel says, even if he gave it to her on condition and the condition was not done, she is not pasul from kohanim.
Tet: One who divorces his wife and she stays the night with him at an inn (where they were seen to be alone), Beit Shamay says, she does not need a second get from him (for if they had relations, that would be engagement, which needs a get), and Beit Hillel says, she needs from him a second get.  When?  When they were divorced from marriage, and that agree that when they were divorced from engagement that she does not need a second get from him, for his heart is not coarse before her (he is not uncaring about her opinion, and won’t have relations with her).  If he married her with (based on) a get kere’ach (it was instituted that a get would be written a few lines at a time and then sewn closed, and if there are not signatures on each sewn fold, it is called a bald get, get kere’ach, and is invalid), she exits from this and that, and all of these ways are upon her.
Yud: A get kere’ach may be completed (the unsigned folds may be signed) by anyone according to Ben Nanas.  Rabi Akiva says, only relatives fit to testify elsewhere complete it (in addition to non-relatives).  And which is a get kere’ach?  All whose ties (folded portions) are more than its witnesses.
