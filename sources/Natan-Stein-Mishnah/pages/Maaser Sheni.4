Aleph: One who take ma’aser sheni produce from an expensive place to a cheap one, or from the cheap to the expensive, her redeems it as the price of the (current) place.  One who brings grain from the threshing floor to the city of wine from the winepress to the city, the increase in value is ma’aser sheni, and the transportation (cost) is from the owner.
Bet: One may redeem ma’aser sheni at a cheap price, as a shopkeeper buys (wholesale price) not sells (retail price), the rate at which a moneychanger accepts, and not at which he exchanges.  One may not redeem ma’aser sheni as a mound (and not measure).  If an object’s price is known, he may redeem based on one (judge), and that which isn’t known, it may be redeemed based on three, like wine that has formed a film, rotten fruit, or rusty coins.
Gimmel: If the owner says, (I will redeem some ma’aser sheni) for a sela, and another said, for a sela, we take the owner first, because he has to add chomesh (whereas another doesn’t have to if it’s not his).  If the owner says, for a sela, and another person says, for a sela and an issar, we take the one who says a sela and an issar first, because he is adding to the principal.  One who redeems his ma’aser sheni adds a fifth, whether it’s his or whether he was given it as a gift.
Daled: One maybe clever regarding ma’aser sheni.  How so?  One say to his adult son or daughter or his Jewish slave or servant, here is this money, and redeem for yourself this ma’aser sheni (which exempts him from chomesh).  One may not say this to his minor children of to his Cana’ani slave or servant, for their hands are considered his.
Hay: One was standing in the threshing floor, but he had no money at his disposal (to pay chomesh either), he may say to his friend, this produce is given to you as a gift, the friend returns and says, this produce is redeemed on money I have in my house.
Vav: One acquired ma’aser sheni from his friend for a sela, and he didn’t manage to redeem it and the price went up to two sela, he gives a sela and profits a sela, and the ma’aser sheni is his.  If he acquired the ma’aser sheni for two sela, and the price went down to one, he gives the person a sela of chulin, and the ma’aser sheni sela is his.  If he was an am ha’aretz, he may give from dmai.
Zayin: One who redeemed ma’aser sheni but didn’t specify (the money, simply setting it aside), Rabi Yossi says, it’s enough, but Rabi Yehuda says, he must specify.  One was speaking with a woman regarding the matter of her divorce or betrothal, and he gave her her divorce or betrothal, but he didn’t specify it, Rabi Yossi says, it’s enough, but Rabi Yehuda says, he must specify.
Chet: One who puts aside an issar, but only eats half of it, if he goes to another place where it’s worth a pundyon (two issar), he eats upon his money the worth of another issar.  One who sets aside a pundyon, and he ate half of it, and he goes to another place where it’s worth an issar, he may eat upon his money the worth of another half (an issar).  One who sets aside an issar of ma’aser sheni, one may eat one eleventh on an issar or one hundredth of an issar (there is much disagreement about the meaning of this phrase, but non are particularly conclusive).  Beit Shamay says, always one tenth, but Beit Hillel says, for definite (tevel) one in eleven, in dmai, one in ten.
Tet: All coins which one finds are (assumed) chulin, even a golden dinar with silver and copper coins (not usually mixed unless being redeemed).  If one found among them a piece of pottery upon which is written ‘ma’aser,’ it is all ma’aser.
Yud: If one finds a vessel and it is written upon it ‘korban,’ Rabi Yehuda says, if it is pottery, it’s chulin, and what is inside of it is korban.  If it’s metal, it is a korban, and what is inside of it is chulin.  They said to him, people don’t put chulin inside a korban.
Yud Aleph: One finds a vessel with a kuf on it, it’s korban, a mem, ma’aser, a daled, dmai, a tet, tevel, and a taf, truma, for in times of danger they would write taf instead of truma.  Rabi Yossi says, they are all people’s names.  Rabi Yossi said, even if he fond a barrel filled with fruit and it says on it, ‘truma,’ it is chulin, for I say, last year it was filled with truma and it has been emptied.
Yud Bet: One who says to his son, ma’aser sheni is in that corner, and it was found in another corner, the produce is chulin.  If (he says,) there is a maneh, and it’s found to be two hundred zuz, the extra is chulin.  If he said two hundred and one hundred was found, it’s all ma’aser.
