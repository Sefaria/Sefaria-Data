Aleph: Beit Shamay says, only those who have been (only) engaged may refuse (a girl whose father died and she was contracted to engagement may, upon reaching adulthood, refuse the engagement).  And Beit Hillel says, engaged and married.  Beit Shamay says, a husband, but not a yavam (may be refused).  Beit Hillel says, a husband and a yavam.  Beit Shamay says, (she may only refuse) in his presence.  Beit Hillel says, in his presence or not in his presence.  Beit Shamay says, in court.  Beit Hillel says, in court or out of court.  Beit Hillel said to Beit Shamay, she may refuse when still a minor, even four or five times (different husbands).  Beit Shamay said to them, the girls of Yisra’el are not ownerless, rather she refuses and waits until she grows up and she’ll refuse and get married (to end the refusals, which happen without a get).
Bet: Which is a minor who has to refuse?  All who her mother and brother married with to her knowledge, if they married her without her knowledge, she does not need to refuse.  Rabi Chanina ben Antigonus says, any girl who can’t guard her kiddushin (money or a document given to her) does not need to refuse.  Rabi Eliezer says, the act of a minor is nothing rather (she is as) one who was seduced.  (If she was) a bat yisra’el (contracted to) a kohen she may not eat truma, and a bat kohen to a yisra’el, she may eat truma.
Gimmel: Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, any hindrance (on the girl’s rights) which is (stems) from the husband, it is as if she is his wife (those rights are hindered).  And any hindrance which is not from the husband, it is as if she is not his wife.
Daled: One who refuses a man, he is allowed to (marry) her relatives, she is allowed to his relatives, and he didn’t make her pasul from kehuna (marrying a kohen).  If he gave her a get, he is assur from her relatives, she is assur from his relatives, and he made her pasul from kehuna.  If he gave her a get and took her back, she refused, she married another, and she became a widow or divorced, she is permitted to return to him (the first husband).  If she refused and he took her back, he gave her a get, she married another, and she became a widow or divorced, she is forbidden to return to him.  This is the general rule, a get after refusal, she is forbidden to return to him, refusal after get, she is permitted to return to him.
Hay: One who refuses a man, marries another and he divorces her, (she was married) to another and she refused him, to another and he divorced her, and to another and she refused him, all who she exited from with a get she is assur to return to him, (all who she exited) with refusal, she is mutar to return to him.
Vav: One who divorces a woman and takes her back, she is mutar to the yavam (though she had been assur to him when she was divorced from his brother), and Rabi Eliezer forbids.  And so too one who divorces an orphan and takes her back, she is mutar to the yavam, and Rabi Eliezer forbids.  A minor whose father married her (to a man) and he divorced her, she is like an orphan (even) during the life of the father.  If he takes her back, everyone agrees she is assur to the yavam.
Zayin: Two brothers married to two minor, orphan sisters and the husband of one of them died, she is exempt because of (the prohibition against) the wife’s sister.  And so too with two deaf-dumb women.  (If the sisters were) and adult and a minor and the husband of the minor dies, the minor is exempt because of the sister of the wife.  If the husband of the adult dies, Rabi Eliezer says, they instruct the minor to refuse him.  Raban Gamliel says, if she refused him, she refused him, and is not, she’ll wait until she grows up ad then she’ll be exempt because of the sister of the wife.  Rabi Yehoshua says, woe to him on his wife and woe to him on the wife of his brother, he divorces his wife by a get (we don’t like having refusal done), and the wife of his brother with chalitza.
Chet: One who was married to two minor orphans and died, having sex with or doing chalitza for one of them exempts her rival, and so too with two deaf-dumb women.  A minor and a deaf-dumb woman (neither of which is a fully valid marriage), having sex with one of them does not exempt her rival.  A woman of sound senses (not deaf-dumb) and a deaf-dumb woman, having sex with the woman of sound senses exempts the deaf-dumb, but having sex with the deaf-dumb does not exempt the one of sound senses.  An adult and a minor, having sex with the adult exempts the minor, but having sex with the minor does not exempt the adult.
Tet: One who was married to two minor orphans and died, if the yavam had sex with the first one and returned and had sex with the second, or his brother had sex with the second, he didn’t make the first pasul (from marrying him), and so too with deaf-dumb women.  A minor and a deaf-dumb woman, if the yavam had sex with the minor and returned and had sex with the deaf-dumb, or his brother had sex with the deaf-dumb, he did not pasul the minor.  If the yavam had sex with the deaf-dumb and returned and had sex with the minor or his brother had sex with the minor, he made the deaf-dumb pasul.
Yud: A woman of sound senses and a deaf-dumb woman, if the yavam had sex with the woman of sound senses and returned and had sex with the deaf-dumb, or his brother had sex with the deaf-dumb, he did not pasul the woman of sound sense.  If the yavam had sex with the deaf-dumb and returned and had sex with the one of sound senses, or his brother had sex with the one of sound senses, he made the deaf-dumb pasul.
Yud Aleph: An adult and a minor, if the yavam had sex with the adult and returned and had sex with the minor, or his brother had sex with the minor, he did not pasul the adult.  If the yavam had sex with the minor and returned and had sex with the adult, or his brother had sex with the adult, he made the minor pasul.  Rabi Elazar says, they instruct the minor to refuse him.
Yud Bet: A minor yavam who has sex with a minor yevama, they grow up together (before he divorces her).  If he has sex with an adult yevama, she (waits for him to) grow up.  A yevama who said within thirty days (of marriage), he did not have sex with me, they force him to do chalitza for her (we believe her), after thirty days, they ask him to do chalitza for her (they assume that they have had sex).  And if he admits, even after twelve months, they force him to do chalitza for her.
Yud Gimmel: One who vows (against deriving) pleasure from her yavam, (if she made the vow) when her husband was alive (and therefore she did not see this vow as conflicting with the mitzva of yibum), they force him to do chalitza for her, (if) after her husband’s death, they ask him to do chalitza for her.  And if she intended for such, even if (it was) when her husband was alive, they ask him to do chalitza for her.
