Aleph: They brought out for him the scoop and the pan and he filled his handfuls and put it into the scoop, the large (amount of incense) according to his (hands’) largeness and the small according to its smallness, and that was its measurement.  He took the pan in his right and the scoop in his left.  He would walk in the sanctuary until he gets to between the two curtains which divide between the holy and the holy of holies, and there was an amah between them.  Rabi Yossi says, there was only one curtain there, as it says, and the curtain shall divide for you between the holy and the holy of holies.”  The outer was clasped (folded to make an opening) in the south and the inner to the north.  (The kohen gadol would go in on the south side,) walk between them, until he got to (enter the holy of holies on) the north side.  When he got to the north, he would turn to face the south, walk to his left with the curtain until he reached the ark.  When he got to the ark he put the pan between the two bars (of the ark).  He piled the incense on the coals and the entire house filled with smoke.  He exited in the same way he had entered, prayed a short prayer in the outer house, and didn’t lengthen his prayer so as not to alarm the people (that he may have died).
Bet: From when the ark was taken (after the first Beit Hamikdash was destroyed) there was a stone there from the days of the early prophets and it was called shtiya (foundation), it was above the ground by (the length of) three fingers and on it he would put (the incense).
Gimmel: He took the blood from the person stirring it, he entered the place he had entered (the holy of holies) stood in the place he had stood, and sprinkled on it one above and seven below, and he didn’t set himself (his hand in the normal way to) to spray up or down, rather (he held his hand) as a whip (is held).  And this is how he would count, one, one and one, one and two, one and three, one and four, one and five, one and six, one and seven.  He came out and rested it on the golden stand that was in the sanctuary.
Daled: They brought him the goat and he slaughtered it and got its blood in a bowl.  He entered the place he had entered (the holy of holies) stood in the place he had stood, and sprinkled on it one above and seven below, and he didn’t set himself (his hand in the normal way to) to spray up or down, rather (he held his hand) as a whip (is held).  And this is how he would count, one, one and one, one and two etc.  He came out and rested it on the second stand that was in the sanctuary.  Rabi Yehuda says, there was only one stand there.  He took the blood of the bull and rested the blood of the goat and he sprinkled from it on the curtain which is opposite the ark on the outside, one above and seven below etc.  He poured the blood of the bull into that of the goat, and put the full (bowl) into the empty one.
Hay: “And he will go out to the mizbe’ach which is before Hashem,” this is the golden mizbe’ach.  He began sprinkling and moved downwards.  From where does he start?  From the northeast corner, northwest, southwest, southeast.  The place he starts for the sprinkling on the outer mizbe’ach, from there he would finish on the inner mizbe’ach.  Rabi Eliezer says, he would stand in his place and sprinkle (without moving around the mizbe’ach).  And on all of them he would sprinkle from bottom to top, except that which was before him, for on that one he would sprinkle from top down.
Vav: He sprinkled on the surface of the mizbe’ach seven times and the rest of the blood he would spill on the western base of the outer mizbe’ach, and of the outer mizbe’ach he would spill on the southern base (of the mizbe’ach).  And both of these mix in a trench, go out to the Kidron river, were sold to gardeners as manure, and there is me’ila by them (they cannot be used unless paid for).
Zayin: All of the actions of Yom Hakippurim (that) were stated (needed to be done) in order, if he made a thing earlier than another, he didn’t do anything.  If he made blood of the goat come before the blood of the bull, he must return and sprinkle from the blood of the goat after the blood of the bull.  And if before he finished the sprinkling within the blood was spilled, he will bring different blood and he returns and sprinkles from the start inside.  And so too in the sanctuary, and so too with the golden mizbe’ach, for they are all an atonement in their own right (a separate piece which must be repeated).  Rabi Elazar and Rabi Shimon say, from the place he stopped he (re)starts.
