Aleph: A rebellious son, when is he considered rebellious?  Only in the time period from when he grows two beard hairs until the time he has a full beard, the lower (pubic) and not upper (facial), the rabbis spoke in clean language.  This timeframe comes from the pasuk, “when a man should have a son,” son and not daughter, son and not a man.  A minor is exempt, for he has not come under the generality of mitzvot.
Bet: When is the rebellious son liable to be stoned?  When he eats a certain amount (tartemeymar) of meat and drinks a certain amount (half log) of Italian (very fine) wine.  Rabi Yossi says, a maneh of meat and a log of wine (both twice tanna kama).  If he ate it at a religious gathering, at the declaring of the month, as ma’aser sheni in Yerushalayim, he ate animals that died of natural causes, torn flesh, a sheketz or a remes, he ate food of mitzva or avera, ate anything other than meat or drank anything other than wine, he isn’t a rebellious son, until he eats meat and drinks wine, as it says, “a glutton and a drunkard.”  Even though there is no proof for this, there is a hint, as it says, “do not be among gluttons of meat or drunkards of wine.”
Gimmel: If he stole from his father and ate on his property, from others and ate on their property, from others and he ate on his father’s property, he’s not a rebellious son.  Only when he steals from his father and eats on another’s property.  Rabi Yossi bar Rabi Yehuda says, until he steals from his father and his mother.
Daled: If only one of his parents wants him to be judged, he cannot be a rebellious son, for only if both parents want.  Rabi Yehuda says, if his mother is not of the same level as his father, he cannot be a rebellious son.  If one of the parents was missing a hand, lame, mute, blind, or deaf-mute, he doesn’t become a rebellious so, as it says, “they will catch him,” not missing a hand, “and take him out,” not lame, “and they’ll say,” not mute, “this is our son,” not blind, “he doesn’t listen to us,” not a deaf-mute.  They warn him in the presence of three people and whip him.  If he repeated his rottenness, he is judged by twenty-three.  And the initial three must be there, for it says, “this is our son,” the one who was lashed in your presence.  If he ran away before his trial was finished, but his beard had finished growing he’s patur.  If he ran away after the trial was finished and his beard grew in, he’s still chayav.
Hay: A rebellious son is judged based on his future, let him die innocent and not guilty, for the death of the wicked is pleasure for them and for the world, but of the righteous is bad for them and the world.  Wine and sleep (i.e. neutral time) for the wicked is pleasure for them and for the world, and for the righteous, good for them and the world.  Not congregating with others, for the wicked is good for them the world and for the righteous, bad for them and the world.  Convening with others and quiet are the same as the first two cases.
Vav: A thief caught breaking in is judged based on his future.  If he breaks a barrel of wine, if he is prohibited to kill the thief (it is known the thief would not come to kill the owners) he pays, and if he would be allowed to kill the thief, he is patur.
Zayin: And these are those who we save from sin by taking their life: one who is chasing his friend to kill him or chasing a betrothed maiden.  But one who is chasing after an animal, desecrating Shabbat, or committing idolatry, we don’t save them by taking their life.
