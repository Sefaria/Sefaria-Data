Aleph: If three eat together, they have to make a zimun.  If you eat dmai, truma from a ma’aser, redeemed ma’aser sheni or hekdesh, or a servant who ate a kzayit, or a kuti, you make a zimun with them. But if you ate tevel, ma’aser that didn’t have truma taken, unredeemed ma’aser sheni or hekdesh, or a servant who ate less than a kzayit, or a non-Jew, you don’t do a zimun with them.
Bet: Women, slaves, and minors aren’t included in a zimun.  How much do you need to have to be in a zimun?  A kzayit.  Rabi Yehuda says a kbeitza.
Gimmel: How do you do a zimun?  With three you say, nevarech, four (or any number mentioned plus him), barchu. 10, nevarech elokeynu. One opinion is 1one or 110,000 it’s all the same.  The other lists things for 100, 1,000, and 10,000 and a response.  The second opinion is of Rabi Yossi Haglili, who says you do different things for different numbers according to a pasuk.  The first opinion is Rabi Akiva who says in a big or small shul, you still say barchu.  Raban Gamliel agrees with Rabi Akiva.
Daled: If three eat together, they can’t separate to bench until they reach 6.  And 10 don’t separate until they reach 20.
Hay: Two groups eating in one house.  If they can see each other, they bench together, if not, not.  Rabi Eliezer says you don’t bless on wine until you mix it, and Chachamim say you do.
