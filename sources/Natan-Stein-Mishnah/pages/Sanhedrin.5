Aleph: They would examine the witnesses with seven examinations: which cycle-week (week of the yovel cycle), in which year, in which month, what day of the month, what day of the week, what time, and where.  Rabi Yossi says, what day of the week, what time, where, do you know him, and did you warn him.  They add for someone accusing of avoda zara, who did he worship and how did he worship.
Bet: The more examinations, the better.  Once, Ben Zakai examined about the twigs of a fig tree.  What is the difference between examinations and checks?  Examinations, if one says, I don’t know, the testimony is invalid.  In a check if one or even two say, I don’t know, their testimony stands.  In either examinations or checks, if they contradict each other, their testimony is invalid.
Gimmel: If one says it was the second of the month and the other says the third, their testimony stands, for one might know about the extending of the month and one may not.  If one says the third and one says the fifth, their testimony is invalid.  If one says it was at 2:00 and one says at 3:00, their testimony stands.  If one says it was at 3:00 and the other says at 5:00, their testimony is invalid.  Rabi Yehuda says it stands.  If one says at 5:00 and one says at 7:00 their testimony is invalidated, for at 5:00 the sun is in the east, and at 7:00 it is in the west.
Daled: Afterwards, they bring in the second witness.  If they are consistent, they open with acquittal.  If one of the witnesses says, I can argue for acquittal, or one of the clerks says, I can argue for conviction, we silence them.  If one of the clerks says, I can argue for acquittal, they raise him up amongst them, and he doesn’t return down the entire day.  If he has something meaningful to say, they listen to him.  And even if the defendant says, I can argue for my acquittal, they listen to him provided he has something meaningful to say.
Hay: If they found for him merit, they set him free, if not, they transfer the sentence to the next day, they would pair up (to review the case more), eat less, not drink wine the whole day, deliberate all night, get up early the next morning and come to the court.  One who found innocent would say, I acquit (yesterday), and I find for acquittal in my place.  The one who found guilty would say, I convict, and I find for conviction in my place.  One can change from conviction to acquittal, but not vice versa.  If they make a mistake in a matter, the scribes tell them.  If they find him innocent, they free him.  If not, they stand for the count.  If twelve acquit and eleven convict, he is acquitted.  If twelve commit and eleven acquit, even if eleven find each way and one says, I don’t know, and even if twenty-two find one way and one says I don’t know, they add judges.  How many can they add?  Two at a time, up until seventy-one.  If thirty-six acquit and thirty-five convict, he goes free.  Thirty-six convict and thirty-five acquit, they discuss with each other until one agrees to acquit.
