Aleph: There are those who inherit and bequeath, there are those who inherit but do not bequeath, (there are those) who bequeath but do not inherit, (and there are those who) do not inherit and do not bequeath.  These inherit and bequeath, a father to his sons, sons to their father, and brothers from (the same) father, they inherit and bequeath.  A man to his mother, a man to his wife, and the sons of sister, they inherit but do not bequeath.  A woman to her sons, a woman to her husband, and brothers of the mother, they bequeath but do not inherit.  And brothers from (the same) mother do not inherit and do not bequeath.
Bet: The order of inheritances is like this, “a man who dies and has no son, and you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter.”  A son comes before a daughter, and all who come out of the loins (descendants) of the son come before the daughter.  A daughter comes before brothers (of the person who died), and (all who) come out of the loins of the daughter come before the brothers.  Brothers come before the brothers of the father (of the person who died), and the ones who come out of the loins of the brothers come before the brothers of the father.  This is the general rule, anyone who comes before in inheritance, those who come out of his loins come before, and the father comes before all who come out of his loins.
Gimmel: The daughters of Tzlofchad (who died without sons) took three parts in an inheritance, the part of their father who was with those who went out of Egypt, and they divided with his (Tzlofchad’s) brothers the property of Chefer (Tzlofchad’s father), and since he was a firstborn, he took two pieces.
Daled: A son and a daughter are one by inheritance (from a father), except that the son takes double (if he is a firstborn) from the property of the father and he does not take double from the property of the mother.  And daughters are maintained (given a stipend by their brothers) from the property of the father, and they are not maintained from the property of the mother.
Hay: One who says, the man so-and-so my firstborn will not take double (inheritance), (or,) the man so-and-so my son will not inherit with his brothers, he did not say anything, for he made a condition on (against) what is written in the torah (which is invalid).  One who divides his property to his sons orally, if he made more for one and less for another, or made the bechor equal (to the others), his words stand.  But if he said, as inheritance, he didn’t say anything.  If he wrote, whether at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end (of his statement), as a gift, his words stand.  One who says, the man so-and-so will inherit me, in a place where he has (only) a daughter, or, my daughter will inherit me, in a place where he has a son, he did not say anything for he made a condition on what is written in the torah.  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka says, if ho wrote for someone who is fit for inheritance, his words stand, but (if he wrote) on someone who is not fit to inherit, his words do not stand.  One who writes his property to others and left out his sons what he did is done, but the spirit of the sages do not rest with him (it is improper).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, if his sons did not act properly, he is remembered favorably.
Vav: One who says, this is my son, he is believed.  (If he says,) this is my brother, he is not believed, and he takes with him in his share (the two of them share one piece).  If he died (the claimed brother), the property returns to its place (with the one who claimed).  If property fell to him (the claimed brother), his brothers (who claimed for him) inherit with him.  One who died and a will was found on his thigh, behold this is nothing.  If he transferred it to another, whether from (one of the) heirs or not from the heirs, his words stand.
Zayin: One who writes his property to his sons must write, from today (the time of writing) and after death, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Yossi says, he does not need to.  One who writes his property to his sons for after his death, the father cannot sell because they are written to the son, and the son cannot sell (them) because they are within the domain of the father.  If the father sol, they are sold until the father dies.  If the son sold it, the buyer does not have anything in it until the father dies.  The father may pick (from a field bequeathed to his son) and feed to anyone he wants, and whay he left picked, behold it is (property) of the heirs.  If he left adult and minor sons, the adults do not prosper on (the property) of the minors, and the minors are not maintained by the adults, rather they divide equally.  If the adults married (and took the costs from the estate) the minors will marry (with money from the estate).  But if the minors said, behold we are marrying in the way you married (and the adults married in the father’s lifetime), they do not listen to them, rather what the father gave them (the adult children in life), he gave.
Chet: If he left adult and minor daughters, the adults do not prosper on the (property of) minors and the minors are not maintained by the adults, rather they divide equally.  If the adults married, the minors will marry.  But if the minors said, behold we are marrying the way you married, they do not listen to them.  This is a stringency by daughters from sons, that the daughters are maintained but the sons and are not maintained by the daughters.
