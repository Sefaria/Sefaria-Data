Aleph: Rabi Eliezer says, we open for a person (a loophole in a vow) with the honor of his father and his mother (we let him go back by saying he would not have wished to impact them with his vow), and Chachamim prohibit.  Rabi Tzadok said, rather than opening for him with the honor of his father and his mother, we should open for him with the honor of the Omnipresent (Hashem).  If so, there are no vows (they could all be opened up).  And the Chachamim agree with Rabi Eliezer that in a thing that is between him and his father and his mother, that they open for him with honor of his father and his mother.
Bet: And furthermore Rabi Eliezer said, they can open for him with an arising circumstance (which had he known about he would not have vowed), and Chachamim prohibit.  How?  Konam that I don’t benefit from so-and-so, and he (so-and-so) became a scribe, or that he was going to marry off his son soon (and the taker of the vow would have liked to attend the wedding), and he said, if I know that he would become a scribe or was marrying off his son soon, I wouldn’t have vowed.  Konam this house that I will not enter, and it became a shul, he said, if I knew it was going to become a shul, I wouldn’t have vowed, Rabi Eliezer unbinds, and Chachamim forbid.
Gimmel: Rabi Meir says, there are things which are like arising circumstances, and they arte unlike arising circumstances, and Chachamim do not agree with him.  How?  He said, konam that I will not marry so-and-so for her father is bad, and they said to him, he died, or he repented. (Or) konam this house that I will not enter for the dog inside it is bad, or there is a snake in it, and they told him, the dog died or the snake was killed, behold this is like an arising circumstance (because he did not foresee them) and not like an arising circumstance (for there was an implied condition in his vow), and Chachamim do not agree with him (Rabi Akiva).
Daled: And furthermore Rabi Meir said, they open for him from what is written in the torah, and they say to him, if you know you were transgressing “you shall not take revenge,” “you shall not bear a grudge,” “you shall not hate your brother (fellow Jew) in your heart,” “and you should love your fellow as yourself,” or, “and your brother shall live with you,” (for if you vow against another person benefiting from you) perhaps he will become poor and you won’t be able to support him, and he said, if I had known that, I wouldn’t have vowed, behold this is unbound.
Hay: They open for a person with the ktuba of his wife.  There was a case with one who vowed against benefit from his wife, and he ktuba was four hundred dinarim, the case came before Rabi Akiva, and he made the man pay his wife the ktuba.  He said to him, Rabbi, my father left eight hundred dinarim and my brother took four hundred and I took four hundred, isn’t it enough for her that she will take two hundred and I will take two hundred?  Rabi Akiva said to him, even if you have to sell the hair on your head, you must give her her ktuba.  He said to him, if I had known it was such I wouldn’t have made a vow, and Rabi Akiva unbound him.
Vav: They open (a vow against some food) with Yom Tov and Shabbat (make the food mutar on them).  At first they would say, those days are mutar, and all the rest of the days (of the time of the vow) are assur, until Rabi Akiva came and taught that a vow which part of it was unbound, the whole thing is unbound.
Zayin: How?  He said, konam that I will not benefit from all of you, if he is unbound from one, he is unbound from all of them.  (If he said,) that I will not benefit from this one and that one (etc.) if he was unbound by the first, they are all unbound, if the last one is unbound, the last is unbound and they are all assur, if a middle one was unbound, him and down (in the chain) are unbound, and from him up is assur.  That I will not benefit from this a korban, and from that a korban, they need an exemption for each.
Chet: Konam wine that I taste, since wine if bad for the bowels.  They said to him, and isn’t old wine good for the bowels?  He was unbound from old wine, and he was unbound not only old wine, but from all wine.  Konam onion that I will not taste, for onion is bad for the heart.  They said to him, isn’t wild onion good for the heart?  He is unbound in wild onion, and not only in wild onion, rather in all onions.  There once was a case and Rabi Meir unbound him by all onions.
Tet: They open for a person with the honor of himself and the honor of his children.  (If one makes a vow to divorce his wife,) they say to him, if you knew that tomorrow, they would say about you, this is the custom of so-and-so, he divorces his wives (would you still divorce her?).  And on your daughters they would say, they are the daughters of divorcees, what was seen in the mothers of these in order to get divorced?  And he said, if I knew that, I would not have vowed, behold  he is unbound.
Yud: Konam that I will not marry so-and-so who is ugly, and behold she is beautiful, black (dark skinned) and behold she is white, short, and behold she is tall, he is allowed by her.  Not because she was ugly and become beautiful, black and became white, short and became tall, rather because the vow was wrong.  And there was a case who vowed against benefiting form the daughter of his sister, and they brought her into the house of Rabi Yishma’el and made her beautiful.  Rabi Yishma’el said to him, my son, did you vow against this one?  And he said, no, and Rabi Yishma’el unbound him.  At the same time, Rabi Yishma’el cried and said, the girls of yisra’el are beautiful, it is only that poverty makes them ugly.  When Rabi Yishma’el died, the daughters of yisra’el raised a lament and said, daughters of yisra’el cry over Rabi Yishma’el.  And so too it says about Shaul, “daughters of yisra’el cry over Shaul.”
