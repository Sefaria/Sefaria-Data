Aleph: A person may take his son who has a stone in his hand and a large basket with a stone inside of it.  And one may carry tame truma with tahor (truma) and chulin.  Rabi Yehuda says, one may even take the meduma in one hundred one (where even if the truma is nullified by a hundred one, one must give one part to the kohen, which Rabi Yehuda holds may be done on Shabbat).
Bet: A stone which is on a barrel, one tilts it on its side and the stone falls.  If it was between barrels, one raises it and tilts it and the stone falls.  Money which is on a pillow, one shakes the pillow and it falls.  If there was an unclean substance on it, he may wipe it with a rag.  If it is made of leather, one puts water on it until it is gone.
Gimmel: Beit Shamay says, one may take from the table bones and shells.  Beit Hillel says, one takes the entire board and shakes it.  One may take from the table crumbs of less than a kzayit, and leftovers of peas and lentils since they are food for animals.  A sponge, if it has a leather handle, one may wash with it, and if not, one may not.  Chachamim say, either way it may be handled on Shabbat, and it doesnâ€™t accept tuma.
