Aleph: What brachot are there on fruits?  On trees ha’etz, except for on grapes, which are hagafen.  On ground fruit ha’adama, except for bread which is hamotzi.  Vegetables are ha’adama.  Rabi Yehuda says they’re boreh minei desha’im.
Bet: An adama on etz is ok, but not vice versa.  Shehakol is ok on everything.
Gimmel: If it’s not grown – shehakol.  Vinegar, unripe fruits, and locusts, shehakol.  Milk, cheese, and eggs, shehakol.  Rabi Yehuda says, all curses aren’t blessed on.

Hay: If you blessed on wine before eating, you don’t have to bless on wine after eating.  So too with an appetizer.  If you blessed on bread, you don’t need to on the appetizer, but not vice versa.  Beit Shamay says it also doesn’t exempt porridge.
Vav: If you sit and eat, you bench alone.  If you made it a group meal, you bench together. If wine comes to them during the meal, they bless separately.  After the meal, one blesses for all of them, and he blessed for besamim, for besamim is only brought after the se’uda.
Zayin: If you have a salted fish with bread, you don’t bless on the bread – it’s tafel.  In general, the ikar is poter hatafel.
