Aleph: Yom Tov of Rosh Hashana which fell out on Shabbat, in the Beit Hamikdash they would blow, but not in the country.  From when the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed Raban Yochanan ben Zakai instituted that they would blow wherever there was a (standing) court.  Rabi Elazar said, Raban Yochanan ben Zakai established in only Yavne.  They said to him (it is the same) whether it is Yavne or every place where there is a court.
Bet: And furthermore in this Yerushalayim was greater than Yavne, for in all cities which can see, hear, is close, and can come (to Yerushalayim) they would blow.  And in Yavne they would only blow in the court.
Gimmel: Originally, lulav was taken in the Beit Hamikdash seven (days) and in the country one.  From when the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed Raban Yochanan ben Zakai instituted that lulav would be taken in the country seven as a remembrance of the Beit Hamikdash, and that one the whole day of shaking (the new grain, on 16 Nisan) it is assur (to eat the new grain).
Daled: Originally, they would take testimony for the new moon the entire day.  Once, the witnesses waited in coming, and the levi’im messed up the song (for they should have said the song for Rosh Chodesh with the afternoon tamid, but they didn’t know it was going to be Rosh Chodesh and they sand the regular song), they established that they would not accept except until mincha.  And if witnesses came from mincha on, they would observe that day sanctified and the next day sanctified.  From when the Beit Hamikdash was destroyed, Raban Yochanan ben Zakai instituted that they would accept testimony for the new moon the entire day.  Rabi Yehoshua ben Karcha said, and furthermore Raban Yochanan ben Zakai instituted this, even if the head of the court is in any place, the witnesses only (need to) go to the place of the meeting (where the court normally sits).
Hay: The order of the blessings (for musaf on Rosh Hashana was as follows), he would say (the blessings titled) forefathers, heroisms, holiness of the name, including malchuyot (kingship) with them, and he doesn’t blow, holiness of the day, and blow, zichronot (remembrances), and blows, shofarot, and blows, and he says temple service, thanksgiving, and (finally) the blessing of the kohanim, according to Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri.  Rabi Akiva said to him, if he doesn’t blow for malchuyot, who does he mention it?  Rather he says, forefathers, heroisms, and holiness of the name, he includes malchuyot with holiness of the day, blows, remembrances, blows, shofarot, and blows, and (then) says temple service, thanksgiving, and the blessing of the kohanim.
Vav: One does not do less than ten (psukim) of malchuyot, ten of zichronot, and ten of shofarot.  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri says, if he says three each, he’s yotze.  One does not mention (psukim) of malchuyot, zichronot, or shofarot of punishment.  He starts with torah and finishes with prophets.  Rabi Yossi says, if he finished with torah, he’s yotze.
Zayin: One who goes before the ark (is the shali’ach tzibur, leader of the congregation) on the Yom Tov of Rosh Hashana, another one blows.  And at the time of Hallel, the first one reads Hallel.
Chet: (For) a shofar of Rosh Hashana one does not pass the (Shabbat) boundaries, and one does not remove a pile of stones from on top of it, one does not climb a tree, one does not ride an animal, one does not swim on the water, one may not cut it with a thing which is assur either because of shvut or because of a lo ta’ase.  But if he wants to put water or wine in it, he may.  One does not stop children from blowing, rather one deals with them until they learn.  And one who does it while engaged (without paying proper attention to the act of blowing) isn’t yotze, and one who hears from someone engaged isn’t yotze.
Tet: The order of the blowings is three of three each.  The length of a tkiya is like three tru’ot.  The length of a trua is like three yevavot (wailings).  If he blew the first and then lengthened it for the second to have as two (blasts) he only has one.  One who blessed (said musaf) and (only) afterwards got a shofar does a tkiya, tru’a, tkiya three times.  Just as the shali’ach tzibur is chayav, so too each individual is chayav.  Raban Gamliel says, the shali’ach tzibur fulfills the obligations for the many.
