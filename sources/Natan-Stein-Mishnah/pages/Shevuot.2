Aleph: There are two laws about tuma, which are four.  One became tame and knew, and he forgot his tuma but remembered (the food) was holy, or forgot it was holy but remembered he was tame, or he forgot both, and he ate and didn’t know, but afterwards found out, he brings a graded korban (the korban is based on how wealthy he is).  If he became tame and knew, and he forgot about his tuma but remembered he was entering the Beit Hamikdash, or forgot he was entering the Beit Hamikdash but remembered he was tame, or forgot both, and he entered the Beit Hamikdash and didn’t know, and after he left he found out, he brings a graded korban.
Bet: (This applies) whether he entered the Temple court or an addition to the Temple court, for one may not add to the city (of Yerushalayim) or on the Temple court unless there are a king, navi, the urim vetumim, a Sanhedrin of seventy-one, two korban toda, and song.  And the court leads the procession and the two korban todas are behind them and all of the Jews are after them.  The inner one is eaten (korban toda) and the outer one is burnt.  And anything which wasn’t done with all of these, one who enters there, he isn’t chayav about them.
Gimmel: If he became tame in the Temple court and forgot about his tuma, he forgot the Temple and remembered he was tame, or forgot both of these and bowed or waited the time of bowing or went out a longer way, he’s chayav, in the shortest way, he’s patur.  This is a positive mitzva in the Beit Hamikdash which one is not chayav for.
Daled: And what is a positive mitzva about nidda which one is chayav for?  He was having sex with a tahor (woman), and she said to him, I have become tame.  If he withdrew immediately, he is chayav, for it was as pleasant to him as his entry.
Hay: Rabi Eliezer says, “a sheretz,” “and he forgot it,” he is chayav for forgetting about a sheretz, but he is not chayav for forgetting the Beit Hamikdash.  Rabi Akiva says, “and he forgets about it and he is tame,” he is chayav for forgetting he is tame, but he is not chayav for forgetting the Beit Hamikdash.  Rabi Yishma’el says, “he forgot, he forgot,” twice to make chayav for forgetting tuma and for forgetting the Beit Hamikdash.
