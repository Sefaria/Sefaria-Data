Aleph: (If one said,) behold I am a nazir from dried figs and fig cake (which are not forbidden to a nazir), Beit Shamay says nazir, and Beit Hillel says not nazir.  Rabi Yehuda says, even when Beit Shamay said, they didn’t say except for one who says, behold they are upon me like a korban  (intends to use nazir in the sense korban is used in).
Bet: If he said, this cow said, I am a nezira if I stand (as if this is the reason the cow is crouching), this door said I am a nazir if I open (the reason the door is not opening), Beit Shamay he is a Nazir (if he manages to make the cow stand or door open), Beit Hillel says, he is not a nazir.  Rabi Yehuda said, also when Beit Shamay said, they didn’t say except when one says, behold this cow is upon me like a korban if it stands (he intended to forbid himself from the cow if he could not make it stand).
Gimmel: They mixed him a cup (of wine) and he said, behold I am a nazir from it, behold he is a nazir.  There was a case with a woman who was drunk, and they mixed her a cup, and she said, behold I am a nezira from it.  Chachamim said, she only intended to say, behold it is upon me like korban.
Daled: Behold I am a nazir on condition that I will drink wine and become tame for the dead, behold he is a nazir and is assur by all of them.  I know that there is such a thing as nezirut, but I didn’t know that a nazir is prohibited from wine, behold he is prohibited, and Rabi Shimon permits.  I know that a nazir is assur by wine but I thought that the Chachamim would unbind me for I can’t live without wine, or because I bury the dead, behold he is unbound, and Rabi Yehuda forbids.
Hay: Behold I am a nazir and the (korbanot offered with the) shaving of a nazir (at the end of his nezirut) are upon me (when some other nazir shaves).  And his friend heard him and said, and it is upon me to shave a nazir.  If they were shrewd, they would shave each other, and if not, they shave other nezirim.
Vav: Behold it is upon me to shave half a nazir, and his friend heard and said, and I (too) shaving half a nazir is upon me, this one shaves a whole nazir, and this one shaves a whole nazir according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, this one shaves half a nazir (pays for half of the korbanot) and this one pays half a nazir.
Zayin: Behold I am a nazir when I have a son, and a son was born to him, behold he is a nazir.  If a daughter, tumtum (person of indeterminate gender) or androgynous (person having characteristics of both genders) was born to him, he is not a nazir.  (If he said) when I see that I will have a child, even is a daughter, tumtum, or androgynous was born to him, behold he is a nazir.
Chet: If his wife miscarried, he is not a nazir.  Rabi Shimon says, he should say, if it was (destined to be) viable (were it not for the miscarriage), I am a nazir by obligation, and if not, I am an optional nazir.  If she gave birth again, behold he is a nazir.  Rabi Shimon says, he should say, if the first was viable, the first (nezirut) was obligatory and this is optional, and if not the first was optional and this is obligatory.
Tet: Behold I am a nazir and a nazir when I have a son, he began to count his and then he had a son, he completes his, and then counts for his son.  Behold I am a nazir when I have a son and a nazir (now), he started to count his and then a son was born to him, he lays his to the side and starts to count that of his son, and afterwards completes his.
Yud: Behold I am a nazir when I have a son, and a nazir for a hundred days.  If a son was born to him up to seventy (days in), he didn’t lose anything (he may pick up after the nezirut for his son).  After seventy, he blocks off the seventy (does not count them in fulfilling his vow), for there is no shaving (to mark the end of nezirut) for less than thirty days.
