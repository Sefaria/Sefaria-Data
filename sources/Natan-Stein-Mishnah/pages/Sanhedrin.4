Aleph: Both monetary and capital cases require inquiry and examination, as we have a pasuk requiring us to have one manner of law.  What are the differences between monetary and capital cases?  Monetary are by three, capital by twenty-three.  Monetary cases can open discussion for either side, and capital can open discussion only with acquittal.  Monetary cases can rely on one for either side, and capital cases require an extra to convict.  Monetary cases can have the verdict changed either way, but in capital cases, the verdict can only be changed to conviction.  In monetary, clerks can present arguments for both sides, for capital, only for acquittal.  In monetary, judges can switch sides, but in capital, they may only switch to arguing acquittal.  Monetary suits start during the day and end at night, but capital cases are started during the day and finished during the day.  Monetary suits can finish the day they start, but capital cases can finish for acquittal that day, but for conviction only the following day.  Therefore, we don’t judge capital cases on erev Shabbat or erev Yom Tov.
Bet: Cases of purity versus impurity begin with the greatest judge’s opinion, but capital cases begin with the most junior.  Anyone can judge monetary cases, but the only people who can judge capital cases are kohanim, levi’im, and yisra’elim who are eligible to marry their daughters to kohanim.
Gimmel: The Sanhedrin was like half of a round threshing floor, so they could see each other.  And two scribes of the judges would stand before them, one on the right, one on the left, one rights arguments for acquittal, and one writes arguments for conviction.  Rabi Yehuda says, three, one for each side and one to record everything.
Daled: Three rows of clerks sat before them, and each one knows his place.  If they needed to add judges, they add the first, and then one person from the second row comes to the first, and one comes from the third to the second, and they choose one more person from the assembly who fills the last seat, not that of the first, for he knows his place.
Hay: How do we make sure we believe witnesses in a capital case?  They would take them in and interrogate them, perhaps you are speaking from supposition, from hearsay, from another witness, or from a trustworthy person.  Or, perhaps you don’t know that we will test you by inquiry and examination.  Know that capital cases are not like monetary suits, that a person gives money and is exonerated, capital cases his life and the life of his offspring hinge upon the case for eternity, as we found by Kayin when he killed his brother, where the pasuk says, “dmei achicha,” not, “dam achicha,” to show that it’s also his offspring.  Alternatively, his blood was cast on trees and rocks.  Therefore, man was created singly to teach you that anyone who takes a life it is as if he killed the entire world, and all who save a life it is as if they saved the entire world.  And for peace among men, so that one person shouldn’t say to another, my father is greater than yours, and heretics should not say there are many powers in heaven.  And do show the greatness of Hashem, for you make several rings from one mould and they all come out the same, but Hashem made all people from one mould and we are all different.  Therefore, everyone may say, the world was created for me.  And if the witnesses say, why should we go through this trouble, because don’t we have a pasuk that if one sees something but doesn’t testify, he bears the sin?  And maybe they’ll say, why should we be responsible for this person’s life?  And you say, when the wicked perish there is joy.
