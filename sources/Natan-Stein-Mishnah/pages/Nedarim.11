Aleph: And these are the vows which he may annul, things which have self-denial, if I wash, if I don’t wash, if I will wear jewelry, if I won’t wear jewelry.  Rabi Yossi said, these are not vows of self-denial.
Bet: And what are vows of self-denial?  If she said, konam the produce of the world upon me, behold he can annul this.  The produce of this country on me, he will bring for her from another country.  The produce of a (certain) storekeeper upon me, he cannot annul.  And if her support was only from him, behold this he may annul according to Rabi Yossi.
Gimmel: Konam that I do not benefit from the creations, he cannot annul, and she may benefit from leket, shichicha, and pe’ah.  Konam kohanim and levi’im benefit from me, they take against his will.  These kohanim and these levi’im benefit from me, other take.
Daled: Konam that I do not do for my father (my work is prohibited to him), and for your father, and for my brother, and for your brother, he cannot annul.  That I do not do for you, he doesn’t need to annul.  Rabi Akiva says, he annuls, lest she do more than what is fit for (owed to) him.  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri says, he annuls, perhaps he will divorce her and she will be forbidden to him (since her handiwork is already forbidden to him). 
Hay: If he wife vowed and he thought his daughter vowed, or his daughter vowed and he thought his wife vowed; she vowed by nazir and he thought she vowed by korban, or she vowed by korban and he thought she vowed by nazir; or she vowed against figs and he thought she vowed against grapes, or she vowed against grapes and he thought she vowed against figs, behold he must go back an annul (again).
Vav: If she said, konam these figs and grapes that I will not taste, if he upheld for figs, he upheld it all.  If he annulled for figs, it isn’t annulled until he annuls grapes also.  If she said, konam figs that I will not taste, and grapes that I will not taste, behold these are two vows.
Zayin: (If one does not revoke his wife’s vow, but later said,) I know that there are vows, but I don’t (didn’t) know (when the vow was taken) that there is annulment, he may annul.  I know that there is annulment, but I don’t know that this is a vow, Rabi Meir says, he may not annul, and Chachamim say, he annuls.
Chet: One who vowed against benefiting from his son-in-law, and he wants to give his daughter money, he says to her, behold this money is given to you as a gift, as long as your husband has no right in it, only what you give and take for your mouth.
Tet: “And the vow of a widow or divorcee (…) will be upheld upon her.”  How?  If she said, behold I am a nezira after thirty days, even if she married within thirty days, he cannot annul.  If she vowed and she is in the domain of the husband, he may annul for her.  How?  Behold I am a nezira after thirty days, even though she became a widow or divorcee, within the thirty, behold (if he husband annulled it) it is annulled.  If she vowed on that day, she divorced that day, and he returned her (to marriage) that day, he cannot annul.  This is the general rule, all who went out to their own authority for (even) one hour, he cannot annul.
Yud: Nine girls whose vows stand, a bogeret who is an orphan, a na’ara (young girl who became a bogeret (before the vow came to fruition) and she’s an orphan, a na’ara who didn’t become a bogeret who is an orphan, a bogeret whose father died, a na’ara become a bogeret and her father died, a na’ara who didn’t become a bogeret whose father died, a na’ara whose father died and since he died she became a bogeret, a bogeret and (even if) her father is alive, and a na’ara who becomes a bogeret and her father is alive.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one who marries off his daughter who is a minor and she became a widow or divorced, and she returned to him (he cannot annul her vows even though) she is still a na’ara.
Yud Aleph: Konam that I (a woman) do not benefit from my father, or from your father if I do for your mouth (work for you), (or) that I do not benefit from you if I do for the mouth or my father or the mouth of your father, behold this he may annul.  
Yud Bet: At first they would say, three woman exit (their marriages) and take their ktuba, the one who says I am tame to you (if she admits she is not fit to marry him), there is heaven between me and you (we cannot be together because Hashem has made this not work i.e. via impotence), I am removed from the Jews (by vow).  They returned saying, so that a woman does not place her eyes with one (lust after someone) and ruin her (marriage with her) husband.  Rather, one who says, I am tame to you must bring proof of her words, heaven is between me and you they plead (with her), and I am removed from the Jews, he may revoke his part (the part of the vow that forbids him), she may sleep with him, and she will be removed from the Jews.
