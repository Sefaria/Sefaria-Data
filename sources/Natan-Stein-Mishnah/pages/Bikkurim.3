Aleph: How does one separate bikurim?  One goes into his field and sees a fig which ripened, a cluster of grapes which ripened, or a pomegranate which ripened, he ties reed-grass around it and says, these are fro bikurim.  Rabi Shimon says, even so, he returns and designates them bikurim after they are separated from the ground.
Bet: How does one take up bikurim?  All the cities in a ma’amad (groups who would send collective gifts to the Beit Hamikdash using a set of agents) would gather in the city of the ma’amad, the people would sleep in the streets of the city, and they wouldn’t enter into houses (for fear of becoming tame).  And for the early risers, the office would say, “get up and we will go to Zion to Hashem our God.”
Gimmel: People close by would bring figs and grapes, and people far away would bring dried figs and raisins.  Before them walked an ox with its horns covered in gold and (wearing) an olive-branch crown.  The flute played before them until they got close to Yerushalayim.  When they got close to Yerushalayim, they sent (people) before them and adorned their bikurim.  The supervisors, deputies, and treasurers went out to meet them, and they went out (in number) according to the honor (size) of the people entering.  And all the craftsman in Yerushalayim would stand before them and greet them, our brothers the people of such-and-such a place, you come in peace.
Daled: The flute played before them until they reached the Beit Hamikdash.  When they got to the temple mount, even King Agrippas would take his basket on his shoulders and bring it in, until he got to the temple court.  When the reached the temple court, the levi’im would say in song, “I will exalt you Hashem for you have raised me up, and you didn’t gladden my enemies about me.”
Hay: The pigeons which were on the baskets would be for olot, and what was in their hands would be for the kohanim..
Vav: When the basket was still on his shoulders, he reads from, “and I shall tell today to Hashem your God,” until he finishes the section.  Rabi Yehuda says, until, “my father was a lost Aramean.”  He says up to, “my father was a lost Aramean,” he takes the basket down from his shoulders, holds it by the rim, a kohen puts his hand under it, waves it, reads from, “my father was a lost Aramean,” until he finishes the section, places it by the altar, bows, and leaves.
Zayin: At first, whoever knew to read would read, and whoever didn’t know, they would read for him.  When they (who didn’t know) refrained from bringing, they instituted that they would read for those who know and those who don’t know.
Chet: The rich would bring their bikurim in baskets of gold and silver, the poor would bring in wicker baskets of peeled willow (bark), and the baskets and the bikurim were given to the kohanim.
Tet: Rabi Shimon ben Nanas says, one may decorate the bikurim with (fruits which are) not the shivat haminim.  Rabi Akiva says, one may only decorate bikurim with the shivat haminim.
Yud: Rabi Shimon says, there are three aspects of bikurim, the bikurim, the addition to the bikurim (not only the first fruits), and the decoration of the bikurim.  Addition to the bikurim is a type among those of its type.  The decoration of the bikurim may be a type in a different type.  The addition to bikurim is eaten while tahor and it is patur if dmai, but the decoration of the bikurim is chayav if dmai.
Yud Aleph: When did they say additions to bikurim are like bikurim?  When it comes from Israel.  If it doesn’t come from Israel, then it isn’t like bikurim.
Yud Bet: Why did they say the bikurim are like the property of a kohen?  For he may buy with them slaves, land, and non-kosher animals, a creditor may take them for his debt, (he may pay) a woman for her ktuba, as a torah (may be used for the previous two examples).  Rabi Yehuda says, one may not give them except to a chaver as a favor.  Chachamim say, one may give them to the kohanim and they would divide them amongst themselves like the (other) holy things of the Beit Hamikdash.
