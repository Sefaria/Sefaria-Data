Aleph: There are three lands to which shvi’it apply, all the land that those who returned from Bavel had, from Israel until Kziv, can’t be eaten from or worked.  All that those who returned from Egypt had, from Kziv until the river until Amana, can be eaten, but can’t be worked.  And from the river and from Amana inward, can be eaten and worked.
Bet: In Syria, one may work the produce that is detached from the ground, but not that which is attached.  One may thresh, winnow, stomp grapes, and bundle, but not harvest, gather grapes, or pick olives.  Rabi Akiva gives a general rule, anything which is allowed in Israel is allowed in Syria.
Gimmel: Onions which had rain water and sprouted, if their leaves are black (fresh and therefore shvi’it), they are assur.  If they become green, these are allowed.  Rabi Chanina ben Antigonus says, if they can be pulled out by their leaves, they are assur, like this during motzei shvi’it, they are mutar.
Daled: From when may a person take vegetables on motzei shvi’it?  Once one of the same species has ripened.  If a place which ripens early has ripened, one may eat from that which ripens late.  Rabi allowed one to immediately take on motzei shvi’it.
Hay: One does not remove oil that must be burned and the fruits of shvi’it from Israel.  Rabi Shimon said, I heard expressly that one may take to Syria, but not outside of Israel.
