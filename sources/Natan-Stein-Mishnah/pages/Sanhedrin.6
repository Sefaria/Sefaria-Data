Aleph: The judgment is finished and they take him out to stone him.  The place of stoning was outside (and far from) the court, as we see in a pasuk.  One stands at the entrance of the court with a scarf in his hand and one rides on a horse at a distance such that he will see him.  If one (comes to court and) says, I have an argument for acquittal, the man waves the scarf and the man on the horse goes to stop them.  And even if he says, I have an argument for my acquittal they return him, even four or five times, as long as he says something substantial.  If they have merit, he is freed, if not, he is stoned.  And a crier goes before him and says, such and such a person is being stoned based on these witnesses, anyone who knows merit for him should come and teach us.
Bet: When he is ten amot from the place of stoning they say to him, confess.  For people who are to be put to death confess, for those who confess have a place in olam haba.  And we saw like this in several psukim about Achan where Yehoshua has him repent, and says, you are uprooted in this world, but not in the world to come.  If he doesn’t know how to confess, they tell him to say, may my death repent for all my sins.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he knows that he is subject to false testimony, he should say, may my death repent for all my sins save this one.  Chachamim said, if so, everyone would say this in order to clear himself.
Gimmel: When he’s four amot away, they undress him.  A woman they cover from the front, and a woman, they cover her front and back, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Chachamim say, a man is stoned naked, but a woman is not.
Daled: The stoning cliff was twice as tall as a man.  One of the witnesses pushes him by his loins.  If he landed on his heart, the witnesses turn him on his back.  If he died from this, he was stoned.  If not, the other witness puts a stone on his heart.  If this kills him, he was stoned.  If not, he is pelted with stones by the people, as we see in a pasuk.  All the stoned are hanged according to Rabi Eliezer.  Chachamim say, he isn’t hanged except for the blasphemer and idolater.  A man is hanged facing the people, and a woman is hanged facing the tree, according to Rabi Eliezer.  Chachamim say a man is hanged, but a woman is not.  Rabi Eliezer said to them, didn’t Shimon ben Shetach hang women in Ashkalon?  They said to him, he hanged eighty women (in one day), and normally you can’t judge two capital cases in one day (meaning we can’t learn from this provisional measure).  How do you hang him?  They stick the post in the ground, a wooden peg protrudes from it, they lay his hands on top of each other, and hang him.  Rabi Yossi says, the post is leaned against a wall, and they hang him as butchers do.  They remove him immediately, for if he stays overnight they have violated a lo ta’ase with him as we see in a pasuk.  Because why are people hung?  For he blessed heaven (a euphemism) and heaven’s name was defiled.
Hay: Rabi Meir says, when one is suffering punishment, what does the Divine presence say?  As it were, I am lighter than my head, I am lighter than my arm.  If so, Hashem grieves on the spilt blood of the wicked, He more so grieves on the spilt blood of the righteous.  And not just this, whoever lets his dead stay (unburied) overnight transgresses a lo ta’ase.  If they did it for the dead’s honor, as in to bring him a coffin and shrouds, they do not transgress.  And they would not bury him amongst the graves of his ancestors, rather there were two graveyards prepared for the court, one for those killed or hanged, and one for those stoned or burned.
Vav: Once the flesh has rotted away, they collect the bones and bury him with his ancestors.  The relatives come and greet the judges and the witnesses, saying that they have nothing in their hearts against the judges and witnesses, for they judged in truth.  They would not become an avel (openly mourn) but grieve, for grieving is only in the heart.
