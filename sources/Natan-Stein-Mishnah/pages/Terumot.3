Aleph: If one took a squash for truma and he found it was bitter (and possibly not fit for food) or a watermelon and he found it was rotten, it is truma, but he must take again.  He took a barrel of wine and it was found to be vinegar, if it is known that it was vinegar before it was taken, it’s not truma, if it’s known to be after he gave it is truma, if it’s unsure, it is truma, but he must take again.  The first doesn’t make meduma (a mixture with chulin) on its own, and one doesn’t owe chomesh if he ate from it, and so too with the second.
Bet: One of them fell into chulin, it doesn’t make meduma, or if the second fell into the place of the first, it doesn’t make meduma.  If they both fell into the same place, it makes meduma according to the smaller of the two.
Gimmel: Partners who took truma one after another, Rabi Akiva says, their trumot are both truma.  Chachamim say, only the first’s is truma.  Rabi Yossi says, if the first took according to the proper measure, the second’s isn’t truma.  If the first didn’t take the full amount, the second’s is truma.
Daled: What is this (Rabi Akiva’s opinion) talking about?  If they didn’t speak (to each other).  But if he gave permission to a family member, his slave, or his maidservant to take, their truma is truma.  If he annulled, if he annulled before they took, the truma isn’t truma.  But if it was after they took, the truma is truma.  Workers don’t have a right to take, except for wine stompers, for they would impurify the winepress immediately (if they didn’t take truma).
Hay: One who says, the truma of this heap is within it, the ma’asrot are within it, and trumat ma’aser is within it, Rabi Shimon says, he declared it.  Chachamim say, he only declares it when he specifies a place.  Rabi Elazar Chisma says, one who says, the truma of the heap, from it, is on it, declared it.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, one who says, a tenth of ma’aser is made trumat ma’aser for it (even within the heap), he declared it.
Vav: One who takes truma before bikurim, ma’aser rishon before truma, or ma’aser sheni before ma’aser rishon, even though he is transgressing a lo ta’ase, what is done is done, as it says, “you shall not delay from your abundance and liquor.”
Zayin: How do we know that you should take bikurim before truma?  This called truma and reshit, and that is called truma and reshit!  Rather, bikurim come first, for they are the first fruits of everything (truma is only from what is harvested), truma before ma’aser rishon, for it is called reshit, and ma’aser rishon before sheni for it contains reshit.
Chet: One who meant to say truma but said ma’aser, meant ma’aser but said truma, meant olah but said shlamim, meant shlamim but said olah, meant I will not enter this one’s house but said (enter) that one, or meant I won’t derive benefit from this one but said (from) that one, he didn’t say anything, until his mouth and his heart agree.
Tet: A non-Jew and a kuti, their truma is truma, their ma’aser is ma’aser, and their hekdesh is hekdesh.  Rabi Yehuda says, a non-Jew has no rule for a fourth year vineyard, but Chachamim say he does.  The truma of a non-Jew makes meduma, and makes it chayav on a chomesh, but Rabi Shimon says it’s patur.
