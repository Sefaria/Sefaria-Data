Aleph: The only kilayim by clothing is wool and linen.  Only wool and linen become tame because of afflictions (probably of tzara’at).  The kohanim only wear wool or linen in the beit mikdash.  Camel wool and ewe wool that were mixed together to make a garment, if it’s mostly camel it may (be mixed with linen), but if mostly ewe it may not.  If it’s half and half, it is forbidden.  So too with linen and hemp that were mixed together.
Bet: Silk and bask-silk are not kilayim, but we don’t mix them because they look like flax.  Large pillows and pillows don’t have an issue of kilayim, as long as one doesn’t touch them.  There is no ‘casual’ kilayim (only temporarily), and he can’t wear kilayim even over ten other garments, even if he’s evading customs (because clothing being worn wasn’t charged).
Gimmel: Hand towels, wraps for torahs, and bath towels have no issur of kilayim.  Rabi Eliezer says they can be assur.  And a barber’s capes do have an issur of kilayim.
Daled: Shrouds for the dead and a donkey’s pack-saddle have no issur of kilayim.  One may not put the pack saddle on his shoulders, even to use as toilet paper.
Hay: Sellers of clothes (who carried their wares on their backs) can sell kilayim garments as usual, as long as they don’t intend to shelter themselves from sun in sun or from rain in rain.  But those who are careful in kilayim carry them on a staff.
Vav: Tailors (who rested the clothes on their knees) may sew as usual, as long as they don’t intend to shelter themselves from sun in sun or from rain in rain.  But those who are careful in kilayim sew on the ground.
Zayin: Birsin, bardesin, dalmatikyon (all woolen garments named based on their places of origin), and felt shoes may not be worn until checked for kilayim.  Rabi Yossi says, clothes from the coast or overseas do not need to be checked, we assume they are made of hemp.  Shoes lined with wool do not have an issur of kilayim.
Chet: The only things which have an issur of kilayim are spun or woven, as we see a pasuk which implies they must be combed, spun, and twisted (into proper threads).  Rabi Shimon ben Elazar says, he is estranged and he estranges his Father in Heaven against him (if he wears kilayim).
Tet: Felted materials (which are unspun) are forbidden, because they are combed.  An edging of wool on linen is assur, because it interlaces the weaving.  Rabi Yossi says, Purple woolen chords are assur on linen, for one generally sews them to the back to hold them up until they are tied.  One may not tie a woolen ribbon on flax to tie up his loins, even though there is a leather strap in between.
Yud: Marks made by weavers or launderers are assur by kilayim.  One who stitches one stitch isn’t connecting, and it isn’t subject to kilayim, but if one undoes it on Shabbat, he is patur.  If one stitches both ends together with a single stitch, it is a connection, and it is subject to kilayim, and one who undoes it on Shabbat is chayav.  Rabi Yehuda says, it’s only subject to kilayim if he makes three.  A sack and a basket fastened together combine for (purposes of) kilayim.
