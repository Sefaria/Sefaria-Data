Aleph: Eight shratzim (a class of animals) are mentioned in the torah, and one who traps them or wounds them is chayav.  Other shekatzim and remasim one who wounds them is patur.  One who traps them for a use is chayav, not for any use is patur.  A wild animal or fowl which is in his domain, one who traps them is patur, and one who wounds them is chayav.
Bet: One may not make himli (a saltwater brine made in large quantities), but one may make salt water and dip his bread in it, and dip in cooked food.  Rabi Yossi said, and isn’t it (the salt water) himli, whether a lot (himli) or a little?  And these are the permitted salt waters, if he first puts the oil (used in himli) in the water or the salt (and not make straight salt water at any time, which is seen as part of curing foods).
Gimmel: One may not eat Greek hyssop on Shabbat, because it is not food of healthy people (it was used as medicine), but he may eat maidenhair and drink liverwort.  One may eat anything as a medicine and drink anything except for palm water (water from a specific spring in Israel) and a cup of root (tea), because they are for jaundice (and it will be clear that he is taking them to cure his jaundice).  But he may drink palm water if he’s thirsty and anoint with root oil if not for medicine.
Daled: One who feels pain in his teeth, he may not swallow vinegar, but he may dip (in vinegar) as he normally would, and if he is healed, he is healed.  One who feels pain in his loins may not anoint in wine or vinegar, but he may anoint with oil, but not rose oil.  Royalty may anoint with rose oil on their wounds, for this is how they anoint during the week.  Rabi Shimon says, all Jews are royalty.
