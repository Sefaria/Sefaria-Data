Aleph: The one (kohen) anointed for (addressing the nation before) war, when he speaks to the nation, he would speak in Hebrew, as it says, “and it will be when you come close to war and the kohen will approach,” this is the kohen anointed for war.  “And he shall speak to the nation,” in Hebrew.  “And he shall say to them, hear Israel, you are getting close today to a war with your enemies,” and not on you brothers.  Not Yehuda against Shimon, not Shimon against Binyamin, for if they (your brothers) shall fall into your hands, you should have mercy on them, as it says, “and the people rose up who were mentioned by name, and the took captives and all of their naked they clothed from the spoils, and they dressed them, gave them shoes, fed them, gave them to drink, anointed them, carried the weak on donkeys, and brought them to Yericho the city of palms by their brothers, and they (the warriors) returned to Shomron.”  Against your enemies you are going, for if they fall into your hand, you do not have mercy on them.  “Let not your hearts be soft, do not be afraid and do not be alarmed etc.” Let not you’re your heart become soft, from the neighing of horses and the sharpening of swords.  Do not be afraid, from the clanging of shields and the large number of soldiers.  Do not be alarmed, from the sounds of the horns.  Do not be frightened, from the sound of the shouting.  “because Hashem your God is walking with you,” they come for the winning of flesh and blood and you come for the winning of Hashem.  The Plishtim came for the winning of Goliat, and what was their end?  In the end, he fell by the sword, and they fell with him.  The children of Ammon came for the winning of Shovach, what was his and?  In the end he fell by the sword, and they fell with him.  And you, you are not like that.  “Because Hashem your God who goes with you to fight for you etc.” this is the camp of the ark.
Bet: “And the officers should speak to the nation saying, who is the man who ha built a new house and has not dedicated it, he shall go and settle his house etc.”  Whether he built a house for straw, cattle, wood, or storage, whether he built, bought, inherited, or received as a gift (he leaves from war).  “And who is the man who planted a vineyard and did not redeem it.”  Whether he planted a vineyard, planted five food trees, even of five types, whether he planted, made runners, or grafted, whether he bought, inherited, or got as a gift.  “And who is the man who engaged a woman,” whether he engaged a virgin, a widow, or even one waiting for yibum, even if he head his brother died in war (and he will need to do yibum), he returns and comes to her (his wife).  All of these hear the words of the kohen while at the battlefront and they return and provide water and food and fix the roads (do safer work for the general welfare).
Gimmel: And these do not return, one who builds a gate-house (for a guard), a portico (covered deck), or a patio, one who plants four food trees or five serak (non fruit-bearing) trees, one who takes back one he divorced, a widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee or chalitza to a lay kohen, a mamzeret or a netina to a yisra’el, a bat yisra’el to a mamzer or natin, he would not return.  Rabi Yehuda says, also one who builds a house on its ruins (rebuilds), he would not return.  Rabi Eliezer says, also one who builds a house of brick in Shomron (where this type of house could not resist wear and was not permanent), he would not return.
Daled: And these do not move from their place (at home), one who built a house and dedicated it, planted a vineyard and redeemed it, married his fiancée, and marries his yevama, as it says, “he shall be clean for his house one year.”  For his house, this is his house.  He shall be, this is his vineyard.  And he shall make his wife happy, this is his wife.  Which he took, to include his yevama.  These do not provide water and food, and do not fix the roads.
Hay: “And the officers shall add on in saying to the nation and say, who is the man who is afraid and soft of heart he shall go and return to his home.”  Rabi Akiva says, who is afraid and soft of heart, like its meaning, for he cannot stand in the rigors of war and see a drawn sword.  Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, afraid and soft of heart, this is one who fears because of the sins in his hand, therefore the torah placed him with all of these (who go back) for he returns because of them (he will not be embarrassed, for people may think he is returning for the other reasons).  Rabi Yossi says, a widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee or chalitza to a lay kohen, a mamzeret or a netina to a yisra’el, a bat yisra’el to a mamzer or natin, behold he is afraid and soft of heart.
Vav: “And it was when the officers finished speaking to the nation, and the officers of the army would count the heads of the nation.”  And at the back of the nation they would station guards before them and others behind them, and iron axes in their hands, and anyone who wants to return (after those who were told to leave) he (the guard) has the right to strike his legs, for the beginning of defeat is deserting, as it says, “Yisra’el fled from before the Plishtim and a great battering was in the nation.”  And there it says, “and the people of Yisra’el fled from the Plishtim and the slain fell down etc.”
Zayin: What is this talking about?  In an optional war (i.e. to take more land), but in a commanded war (i.e. to conquer Israel) all must go, even a groom from his room and a bride from her wedding canopy.  Rabi Yehuda says, what is this talking about?  In a commanded war, but in an obligatory war (i.e. defense) all go out, even a groom from his room and a bride from her wedding canopy.
