Aleph: At first they said, one may gather wood, stones, and grass from his own property just as he can gather from his friend’s property, large pieces (clearly needed, not to tend the field).  When many people would sin they instituted that one should gather from the field of the other, not as a favor (a mutual partnership), and needless to say that it’s not to give food for a trade (to one who gathers things to improve his land).
Bet: A field cleared of thorns may be planted motzei shvi’it.  If it was improved or used to let cows graze, it may not be planted motzei shvi’it.  A field that was improved, Beit Shamay says you may not eat its fruit during shvi’it and Beit Hillel allows it.  Beit Shamay said, one may not eat shvi’it fruit as a favor (from the owner, it’s hefker), and Beit Hillel says, you may eat as a favor or not.   Rabi Yehuda says, flip the opinions, this is a leniency of Beit Shamay and a stringency of Beit Hillel.
Gimmel: One may rent freshly-plowed land from a non-Jew during shvi’it, but not from a Jew.  One may strengthen non-Jews during shvi’it (as in saying, good luck), but not Jews.  And one greets people, to keep the ways of peacefulness.
Daled: One who thins out (clusters of) olive trees, Beit Shamay says, he cuts only to the roots, and Beit Hillel says, he may pull out the roots as well (this is not tending).  What is thinning?  One or two trees.  Leveling?  Three, one next to the other.  What is this talking about?  In his field, but in his friend’s, even if he levels, he can uproot.
Hay: One who cuts wood off an olive tree may not cover it with earth, but covers it with stones or straw.  One who cuts the branches of a sycamore may not cover it in earth, but can cover it with stones or straw.  One may not cut a previously uncut sycamore, because it is considered work (it improves the tree).  Rabi Yehuda says, the normal way of cutting is assur, unless he cuts ten tfachim up or to the roots.
Vav: One who clips grapes or cuts reeds, Rabi Yossi Hagelili says he must keep a tefach from the ground.  Rabi Akiva says, he can cut as usual, with an ax, a sickle, a saw, or anything he wants.  A tree which split may be tied during shvi’it, not such that it will heal, but rather that it won’t continue to split.
Zayin: From when can you eat the fruit of a tree in shvi’it?  The unripe ones, when they glisten, you can eat them with your bread out in the field.  The ripe ones, you may bring into your house.  So too in the rest of the years in the cycle pertaining to when he has to take ma’aser.
Chet: Unripe grapes, from when they produce liquid he can eat them with his bread in the field.  Once they have ripened, he may take them into his house.  And so too in the rest of the years of the cycle pertaining to when he has to take ma’asrot.
Tet: Olives, once they yield a revi’it to the se’ah, he may crush them and eat in the field.  When they produce half a log, he may press and use for skin in the field.  When they yield a third, they may be pressed in the field and taken into his house.  And so too in the rest of the years of the cycle pertaining to when he has to take ma’asrot.  And the rest of the fruits of the tree, their season for ma’aser is the same as their season for shvi’it.
Yud: From when is it forbidden to cut down trees in shvi’it?  Beit Shamay says, all trees when they bring forth leaves.  Beit Hillel says, carobs from when they droop, grapes from when they produce ‘kernels’, olives from when they blossom, and all other trees from when they produce leaves.  And all trees, when they come to the time of ma’asrot, one may cut them down.  How much can be on an olive before it can be cut?  A rova.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, it all depends on the olive tree.
