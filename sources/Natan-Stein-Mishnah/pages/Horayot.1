Aleph: If the court instructed to transgress upon one of any of the mitzvot in the torah, and an individual went and did (transgressed) unintentionally (for he was simply following their ruling), whether they (the judges) did it and he did it with them, they did it and he did it after them, or he did it but they didn’t do it, he’s patur (from bringing a korban) for he depended on the court.  If the court instructed (with an incorrect ruling) and one of them (a judge) knew that they made a mistake, or a student and he is fit to instruct (others), and he went and did based on them, whether they did it and he did it with them, they did it and he did it after them, or he did and they didn’t do it, behold he is chayav, because he did not depend on the court.  This is the general rule, one who depends on himself (his own opinion) is chaya, and on who depends on the court is patur.
Bet: If the court instructed, knew that they made a mistake, and retracted on what they said, whether they brought their atonement (a korban for making the public sin) or they did not bring their atonement, if one went and did based on them, Rabi Shimon says he’s patur, and Rabi Eliezer says it’s doubtful.  What is doubtful?  If he sat in his house (and did not listen to the unfolding of the court’s decision and retraction) he’s chayav, but if he went overseas (where he could not learn of the retraction), he’s patur.  Rabi Akiva said, I agree with this that he (one who went overseas) is close to patur from his obligation (to be punished).  Ben Azay said to him, how is this one different from one who sits in his house?  (Rabi Akiva responded,) for the one who was sitting in his house could have heard (of the retraction), and this one (who went overseas) could not have heard.
Gimmel: If the court ruled (that it is permissible) to transgress upon the whole body (of a specific mitzva, for instance,) if they said, there is no nidda (prohibition of sleeping with a menstruating woman) in the torah, there is no (concept of resting on) Shabbat in the torah, or there is no (prohibition against) avoda zara in the torah, behold these (courts) are patur (from bringing a korban, for the public should know not to listen to them).  If they instructed (to) annul part and uphold part (of a law), behold these (courts) are chayav (to bring a korban).  How?  If they said, there is nidda in the torah, but one who sleeps with one who keeps day by day (a woman who sees emissions outside of her normal menstruation keeps one day each time she has an emission) is patur, there is Shabbat in the torah, but one who takes from a private domain to a public domain is patur, there is avoda zara in the torah, but one who bows down (to avoda zara) is patur, behold these (courts) are chayav (to bring a korban), as it says (about bringing the korban), “and a thing disappeared (from their knowledge)”, a thing, and not a whole body.
Daled: If the court instructed and one of them knew they made a mistake, so he said to them, you are mistaken, (he says the court made a ruling) without the instructing (head) judge there, or one of them was a convert, a mamzer, a natin, or an elder who did not have children (all of whom are not allowed to serve on a court), behold these (courts) are patur, for it is written here (about bringing the korban), “assembly” (edah), and there (about judging a capital case) it says “assembly,” just as the assembly which is said there, (their decision is not valid) until all of them are fit to instruct, also the assembly said here, until they are all fit to instruct.  If the court instructed (wrongly) unintentionally and the congregation did (transgressed) unintentionally (based on the court), they bring a bull (as a korban).  (If they ruled wrongly) intentionally, and (the nation) did unintentionally, they (individuals in the nation) bring a sheep or a goat (as a chatat).  Unintentionally, and they did intentionally (the nation acted regardless of the court’s decision) they are patur (from bringing a korban, but the nation receives punishment for transgressing intentionally).
Hay: If the court instructed and the congregation or most of them did based on them, they bring a bull, and (in a case dealing with) avoda zara, they bring a bull and a goat, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, the twelve tribes bring twelve bulls, and in avoda zara they bring twelve bulls and twelve goats.  Rabi Shimon says, thirteen bulls (one for each tribe plus one for the court) and in avoda zara, thirteen bulls and thirteen goats, a bull and a goat for each tribe and a bull and a goat for the court.  If the court instructed and seven tribes did, or most of them (the tribes), based on them, they bring a bull and in avoda zara, a bull and a goat, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, if seven tribes sinned, they bring seven bulls and the rest of the tribes who did not sin bring a (single) bull, for even those who did not sin bring because of the sinners.  Rabi Shimon says, eight bulls, and by avoda zara, eight bulls and eight goats, a bull and a goat for each tribe (that sinned) and one for the court.  If the court of one of the tribes instructed and that tribe did based on them, that tribe is chayav, and the rest of the tribes are patur, according to Rabi Yehuda.  The Chachamim say, they are not chayav except for an instruction of the great court, as it says, “and if al the assembly of Israel will err,” and not the assembly of that tribe.
