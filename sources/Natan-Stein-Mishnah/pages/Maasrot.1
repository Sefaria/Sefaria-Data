Aleph: There is a general statement by ma’asrot, anything one eats, guards, and grows from the ground is chayav by ma’asrot.  And they said another general statement, anything which can be eaten at the beginning of growth and at the end of growth, even though he lets it grow to increase the food, both the beginning and end are chayav ma’asrot, and anything which starts off as inedible and becomes edible is only chayav once it becomes edible.
Bet: From when are fruits chayav ma’aser?  Figs from when they are one day after picking (bochal), grapes and wild grapes from when seeds show through the skin, sumac and mulberries from when they redden, and all red fruits from when they redden.  Pomegranates from when they soften, dates from when they swell, peaches from when they show veins, and nuts when the fruit separates from the shell, as something placed in a storeroom.  Rabi Yehuda says, nuts and almonds from when they make shells.
Gimmel: Carobs from when they become spotted and all black fruits from when they are spotted.  Pears, pippins, quince, and crab-apples, when they become smooth, and all white fruit from when they become smooth.  Fenugreek from when is can grow (new plants if planted).  Grain and olive, when they have reached a third of growth.
Daled: By herbage, squash, gourds, watermelons, cucumbers, apples, and etrogim, both big and small are chayav.  Rabi Shimon exempts small etrogim.  When bitter almonds are chayav, the sweet are patur and vice versa.
Hay: What is the ‘threshing floor’ (act of completion after which food is assur if tevel) for ma’asrot?  Squash and gourd from when one removes the tail, and if one doesn’t remove the tail, from when they are stacked.  Watermelon, from when they are made smooth (removing the tail), and if he doesn’t smooth them, from when he brings them out to dry.  Vegetables which one usually bundles, from when he bundles them, if he doesn’t bundle them, from when he fills a vessel, if he’s not filling a vessel, once he’s gathered all he needs.  (If the food is going into) a large basket, it’s until he covers it, but if he’s not covering it, until he fills the vessel, if he’s not filling the vessel, until he takes what he needs.  What is this talking about?  When he’s taking it to the shuk, but if he’s taking it home, he may eat randomly until he gets home.
Vav: Pomegranate seeds, raisins, and carobs, from when he stacks them into a pile.  Onions, from when he peels them, if he’s not peeling them, from when he stacks them into a pile.  Grain, from when he neatens the bundles, if he doesn’t neaten them, until he stacks them into a pile.  Legumes, from when he sifts, if he’s not going to sift them, until he neatens the pile.  Even if he has neatened the pile, he may take from the fragmented (not completely threshed), from the sides of the pile (which haven’t been smoothed), or from the inside of husks, and eat (randomly).
Zayin: Wine, from when he skimmed it.  Even if he skimmed, he may take from the upper winepress or the pipe (between the levels of the winepress) and drink.  Oil, from when it descended into the trough.  Even if it descended, he may take from the press-basket, from between the press stones, and from between the press boards and put it on a small cake or a plate, but he may not put it into a pot or saucepan when they are boiling.  Rabi Yehuda says, you can put it into any of them, except for something that has vinegar or brine.
Chet: A fig cake, from when he smoothes it.  One may smooth down (using the juice of) figs or grapes of tevel, but Rabi Yehuda forbids it.  A cake smoothed using grape juice is not susceptible to tuma, Rabi Yehuda says it is.  Dried figs, from when he stamps them down, in a stone bin from when they are pressed together.  If he threshed in a barrel or pressing in a stone bin and the barrel or bin broke, he may not eat from them randomly.  Rabi Yossi allows it.
