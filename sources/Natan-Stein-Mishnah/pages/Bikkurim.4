Aleph: An androgynous has some manners which are similar to men, has some manners similar to women, has some manners similar to men and women, and has some manners similar to neither men nor women.
Bet: How are they like men?  He becomes tame from white (seminal fluid) like men, he dresses like men, he takes a wife and is not taken as a wife like men, his mother sits for him in clean blood like men (thirty-three days after giving birth like men, not women), he may not be alone with women like men, he isn’t maintained like daughters (who get some money after the father’s death) like men, and he would transgress upon not rounding (hair), not destroying (the corners of the beard), and not become tame for the dead (if a kohen) like men, and he is chayav in all the mitzvot in the torah like men.
Gimmel: How is he like women?  He becomes tame from red (menstrual blood) like women, he may not be alone with men like women, he doesn’t make a need to do yibum (for his brother’s wives) like women, he doesn’t divide (inheritance) with his brothers, like women, he may not eat of the holies of the Beit Hamikdash like women, his mother sits for him in unclean blood like women (fourteen days of tuma before the thirty-three clean), he is ineligible for testimony like women, and if he was subjected to sinful (intercourse) he is invalidated from eating truma, like a woman.
Daled: How is he like men and women?  He makes chayav for one who wounds or curses him like man and women, one who kills him accidentally is exiled and intentionally is killed like men and women, his mother brings a korban (after giving birth to him) like men and women, he eats holy things in the borders like men and women, and he inherits all the inheritance (if the only heir) like men and women.
Hay: How is he like neither men nor women?  One doesn’t burn truma on account of their zava and he isn’t chayav for entering the Beit Hamikdash (while having emitted white or red) like neither men nor women, he isn’t sold as a Jewish slave like neither men nor women, and he isn’t given a value like neither a man nor a woman.  And if one said, I am a nazir if this one is neither a man nor a woman, he is a nazir.  Rabi Yossi says, an androgynous is creation of its own, and the Chachamim couldn’t decide about it whether it was a man or a woman.  But a tumtum isn’t like this, (for) there are times he is a man, and times he is a woman.
