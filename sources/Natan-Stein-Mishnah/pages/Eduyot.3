Aleph: All things which (are enough of a corpse) to make tame in a tent which were divided (and were therefore not enough each to be the full amount needed to make tame, such as a kzayit of a corpse’s flesh which was split in half) and were brought into the house, Rabi Dosa ben Harkinas makes tahor, and Chachamim make tame.  How?  One who touches in two halves of a kzayit from a nevela (animal which died naturally) and with a dead body, one who touches a half of a kzayit and makes a tent over half a kzayit, or touches a half a kzayit and half a kzayit makes a tent over him (is above him), or two halves of a kzayit make a tent above him, or he makes a tent above half a kzayit and half a kzayit makes a tent above him, Rabi Dosa ben Harkinas makes tahor and the Chachamim make tame.  But one who touches half a kzayit and another thing makes a tent on him and half a kzayit, or he makes a tent on half a kzayit and another thing makes a tent on him and on half a kzayit, he’s tahor.  Rabi Meir says, even in this Rabi Dosa ben Harkanya makes tahor and the Chachamim make tame, (for the Chachamim hold that) everything is tame, except for touching (half a kzayit) while carrying (half a kzayit but not touching it) and carrying while making a tent.  This is the general rule, everything which is from one name (contact, carrying, or ohel, forming a tent) is tame, from two names, is tahor.
Bet: Food which is separated (such that no piece is big enough to make any others tame) does not combine according to Rabi Dosa ben Harkanya, and Chachamim say it does combine.  One may redeem ma’aser sheni on unstamped coins, according to Rabi Dosa, and Chachamim say, one may not redeem.  One immerses his hands for a chatat according to Rabi Dosa, and Chachamim say, if his hands became tame, his body became tame.
Gimmel: The insides of watermelon (seeds)and extra greens of truma, Rabi Dosa allows for zarim and Chachamim prohibit.  Five ewes each shorn a maneh and a half (of wool) is chayav in the first shearings (which go to the kohen).  Chachamim say, five ewes regardless.
Daled: All mats (with a lip) become tame met (because the lip makes them a vessel) according to Rabi Dosa, and Chachamim say, (they accept even) midras (tuma).  All woven nets are tahor except of a girdle according to Rabi Dosa, and Chachamim say they are all tame except of wool.
Hay: A sling with a woven pouch is tame, and with leather, Rabi Dosa ben Harkanya makes tahor, and Chachamim make tame.  If its finger hole was torn it is tahor (since it is no longer a usable vessel), and if the hand strap (which hold the hand in place while slinging) it is tame (for it can still be used).
Vav: A captive woman (who was the wife of a kohen) may eat truma (which assumes she was not raped), according to Rabi Dosa, and Chachamim say, there are captive women who may eat and there are captive women who may not eat.  How?  A woman who says, I was captured and I am tahor she may eat, for the mouth which forbade is the mouth which allowed (if one’s testimony forbids something, and by extension permits something, it is believed).  And if there are witnesses that she was taken captive, and she says, I am pure, she does not eat.
Zayin: Four doubts Rabi Yehoshua makes tame and Chachamim make tahor.  How?  The tame one (a metzora) stands (under an ohel) and the tahor passes (by, and it is not sure whether he was under the ohel or not), the tahor stands and the tame passes, there is tuma (a tame object) in a private domain and tahara (a similar but tahor object) in the public domain (and we are not sure which one he touched), or there is tahora in the private domain and tuma in the public domain, and it is a doubt if he touched, a doubt if he didn’t touch, a doubt if he had ohel, a doubt if he didn’t have ohel, a doubt if he shifted (the tame object), a doubt if he didn’t shift, Rabi Yehoshua makes tame and Chachamim make tahor.
Chet: Three things Rabi Tzadok makes tame and Chachamim make tahor, the ail of a money changer (used for the scales), the chest of a miller (used to bring ground grain to the shuk), and the nail of a sundial (which casts the shadow), Rabi Tzadok makes tame and Chachamim make tahor.
Tet: Four things Raban Gamliel makes tame and Chachamim make tahor, the covering of panniers (large basket-like vessels) of homeowners, the hangers for metal combs, unfinished metal vessels, and a large (earthenware) plate split into two parts.  And the Chachamim admit to Raban Gamliel that a large plate which split into two, one large and one small, the large is tame and the small is tahor.
Yud: In three things Raban Gamliel was stringent according the opinion of Beit Shamay, one may not insulate hot food from Yom Tov for Shabbat, one may not set a menorah up on Yom Tov, and one may not bake breads (on Yom Tov) in large loaves but rather thin rolls.  Raban Gamliel said, in the days of my father’s house they would not bake large loaves but rather thin rolls.  They said to him, what was done in your father’s house, they would be stringent on themselves and lenient on all yisra’el, to bake breads in large loaves and thick cakes.
Yud Aleph: Also he says three things to be lenient, one may sweep between beds, on may lay spices (on the fire as a perfumant) on Yom Tov, and one may prepare a mekulas goat (a lamb roasted whole) on the night of Pesach, and the Chachamim forbid.
Yud Bet: Three things Rabi Elazar ben Azarya allows and Chachamim forbid, his cow may go out with a strap between its horns, one may comb an animal on Yom Tov, and one may grind pepper in its mill.  Rabi Yehuda says, one may not comb an animal on Yom Tov since it makes a wound, but one may brush.  And Chachamim say, one may not comb, (and one may) even not brush.
