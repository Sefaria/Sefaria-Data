Introduction: The Chachamim taught the language of the Mishna, blessed is He who chose them and their Mishna (this comes as an introduction because the following perek was not originally not canonized with the Mishna but was later added with the custom of learning a perek of Mesechet, or Pirkei, Avot on the Shabbatot between Pesach and Shavuot so that there would be enough prakim).
Aleph: Rabi Meir says, whoever engages in torah for its own sake merits many things, and not only that, rather the whole world is fit (to have been created) for him.  He is called a friend, beloved, one who loves Hashem, one who loves the creations, one who gladdens Hashem, one who gladdens the creations, it clothes him in humility, in fear (awe), it trains him in being righteous, (to being) pious, upright, faithful, distances him from sin, draws him close to merit, people benefit from him advice, (people benefit) understanding, wisdom, and heroism (of character), as it says, “to Me is advice and understanding, I  am wisdom, and to Me is heroism.”  It (torah) gives him kingship, rulership, and discerning in judgment, it reveals for him the hints (secrets) of the torah, and it makes him like an overflowing spring and like a river which does not stop, he becomes modest, slow to anger, forgives his insults (those paid to him), it makes him greater and exalts him above all creations.
Bet: Rabi Yehoshua ben Levi said, every day a bat kol (heavenly voice) comes out from Mount Chorev (Sinai) and declares, saying, woe unto them the creations (comes from) their insulting of the torah.  For whoever does not engage in torah is called rebuked, as it says, “a gold nose ring in the nose of a pig is (like) a beautiful woman who is loose in reason (for this spoils her beauty).”  And it says, “the tablets were the work of Hashem and the writing was the writing of Hashem which was engraved on the tablets,” do not read engraved (charut) but freedom (cherut), for there is no free person other than one who engages in the study of torah, and whoever engages in torah regularly, behold this (person) is uplifted, as it says, “and from Matana (a gift) Nachliel (inheritance of Hashem), and from Nachliel Bamot (high places).”
Gimmel: One who learns from his friend one chapter, one law, one verse, one saying, or even one letter (of torah) needs to act towards him with respect, for so we found with David the king of Israel, for he did not learn from Achitofel other than just two things, and he called him his teacher, his guide, and his familiar (friend), as it says, “and you are a person as my commensurate, my leader, and my familiar one.”  And are these things not a kal vechomer?  Just as David the king of Israel who did not learn from Achitofel other than just two things called him his teacher, guide, and familiar one, one who learns from his friend one chapter, one law, one verse, one saying, even one letter, how much more so that he had to act toward him with respect.  And there is no respect other than torah, as it says, “wise ones will inherit respect,” “perfect ones will inherit good.”  And there is no good other than the torah, as it says, “for a good gift I have given to you, it is My torah, do not leave it.”
Daled: This is the way of (one who learns) torah, he will eat bread with salt, he will drink water by mesura (a small liquid measure), he will sleep on the earth, he will live a life of stress, and he will toil in the torah, but if you do this (to you applies the pasuk), “it is your fortune and good for you,” your fortune in this world and good for you in the world to come.  Do not ask for greatness for yourself and do not covet honor.  Do more than what you learn, do not desire the table of kings, for your table is greater than their table and your crown is greater than their crown.  And the master of your work (Hashem) is trustworthy, for He will pay you the wager of your work.
Hay: Torah is greater than kehuna and than kingship, for kingship is acquired with thirty degrees (has thirty aspects), kehuna with twenty-four (aspects) and torah is acquired with forty-eight things, with study, listening with the ear, lengthening (speech) with the lips, understanding of the heart, knowledge of the heart, awe, fear, humility, happiness, serving sages, exacting with friends, peppering students, settling (emotions), text (of the torah), review, sleeping little, speaking little, enjoying little, joking little, little worldly affairs, slowness to anger, a good heart, trust in the sages, and accepting sorrow.
Vav: (These things are complete the forty-eight things which are needed for torah study) one who knows his place, one who is happy with his portion, one who makes a fence for his words (expresses himself with caution), does not hold a good thing for himself, is loved, loves Hashem, loves the creations, loves justice, loves rebuke, loves straightening out, distances (himself) from honor, does not become haughty with his learning, is not happy to instruct (others what to do), bears a burden with his friend, judges him with favor, establishes him with truth (helps others act properly), stands him up in peace (helps settle arguments), settles his heart with his learning, asks and answers, hears and adds, learns in order to teach, learns in order to do, wisens (even) his teacher, sets his listening (takes care to not what he hears), and one who says something in the name of the one who said it (quotes sources).  Behold you have learned, whoever says something in the name of the one who said it brings salvation to the world, as it says, “and Esther said to the king in the name of Mordechai.”
Zayin: Torah is great for it gives life to those who do it in the word and in the world to come, as it says, “for they are life for those who find them and it heals all of their flesh,” is says, “it will be healing for your flesh and a tonic for your bones,” it says, “it is a tree of life for those who hold and all who grasp it are fortunate,” it says, “for they are a wreath of favor for your head and giant for your necklaces,” it says, “it will give for your head wreathes of favor, crown you with a circlet of splendor,” it says, “length of days are in its right (hand), in its right is wealth and honor,” and it says, “for length of days, years of life, and peace it will add for you.”
Chet: Rabi Shimon ben Menasia says in the name of rabi Shimon ben Yochai, beauty, strength, wealth, honor, wisdom, age, grey hair, and children is good for the righteous and good for the world, as it says, “a crown of splendor is grey hair, it will be found with the way of righteousness,” it says, “the crown of the wise is their wealth,” it says, “the crown of the elders are the children of children, and the splendor of children is their fathers,” it says, “the splendor of young men is their strength, and the beauty of elders is their grey hair,” and it says, “and the moon will was shamed and the sun was embarrassed, for Hashem, God of Legions, ruled on Mount Tzion and in Yerushalayim, and opposite his elders is honor.”  Rabi Shimon ben Menasia says, these are seven aspects which the Chachamim appointed for the righteous, and all of them were fulfilled with Rabi (Rabi Yehuda Hanasi) and his sons.
Tet: Rabi Yossi ben Kisma said, once I was walking on my way, and a man met me, greeted me, and I greeted him back.  He said to me, Rabi, where are you from?  I said to him, from a large city of wise men and scribes.  He said to me, Rabi, do you want to live with me in our place?  I will give you thousands of thousands of golden dinarim, precious stones, and pearls.  I said to him, my son, (even) if you all the silver, gold, precious stones, and pearls in the world, I will not live in a place other than that of torah, for in the time of a person’s departure (death) silver, gold, precious stones, and pearls do not accompany him, only torah and good deeds alone, as it says, “when you go it will lead you, when you lie down it will guard you, and when you awake it will be your conversation.”  “When you walk it will lead you,” in this world, “when you lie down it will guard you,” in the grave, and, “and when you awake it will be your conversation,” for the world to come.  And so too it is written in the book of psalms written by David the king of Israel, “better for you is the torah of your mouth than thousands of (pieces of) gold and silver,” and it says, “for me is the silver and for me is the gold, so said Hashem, Master of Legions.”
Yud: Hashem acquired His world with five acquisitions, and these are they; the torah, one acquisition; heaven and earth, one acquisition; Avraham, one acquisition; Yisra’el, one acquisition; and the Beit Hamikdash, one acquisition.  The torah is one acquisition, from where (do we know this)?  For it writes, “Hashem acquired me (the torah) at the beginning of His ways, before his makings of old.”  Heaven and earth is one acquisition, from where?  For it says, “so said Hashem, the heavens are My chair and the earth is My footstool, what house can you build for Me, and what place can be My resting place?” and it says, “how great are Your creations Hashem, You made them all in wisdom, the world filled with Your possessions.”  Avraham is one acquisition, from where?  For it writes, “and He blessed him and He said, blessed is Avram for the uppermost God Who acquires heaven and earth.”  Yisra’el is an acquisition, from where?  For it writes, “until they will pass, Your nation, Hashem, until they will pass, this nation which You acquired,” and it says, “for the holy ones who are on the earth, they are wonderful and all of My possessions are in them.”  The Beit Hamikdash is an acquisition, from where?  As it says, “the temple of God your hands have prepared,” and it says, “and He brought them to His holy border, this mountain His right (hand) acquired.”
Yud Aleph: All which the Holy one blessed be He created in His world, he did not create other than for His honor, as it says, “all which is called in My name, and for My honor I created it, I formed it, I also made it,” and it says, “Hashem shall reign for ever and eternity.”  Rabi Chanania ben Akashya said, the Holy one blessed be He wanted to merit for Yisra’el, therefore he increased for them torah and mitzvot, as it says, “Hashem desires for the purpose of his righteous ones, may torah be greatened and glorified.”
