Aleph: One who sells a house (without specifying which parts are being sold) has not sold the extension even if it opens into it (the house), not the (external) room which (has an opening) is within it (the house), and not a roof which has a railing higher than ten tfachim.  Rabi Yehuda says, if it (the entrance to the roof) has the form of a (separate) opening, even if it (the railing) is not taller than ten tfachim, it is not sold.
Bet: (If he sells a house without specifying, he has not sold) not a hole (cistern) and not a cellar.  And he must buy for himself (rights to) a path (that is on the property and leads to something not included in the sale) according to Rabi Akiva.  The Chachamim say, he does not need to buy himself a path.  And Rabi Akiva admits, when he (the seller) said to him, except for these (the listed things) he does not need to by a path.  If he (an owner) sold them (the excluded things) to another, Rabi Akiva says, he (the other) does not need to buy for himself the path, but the Chachamim say he needs to by for himself the path. 
Gimmel: One who sells a house sold a door but not they key (because it is portable), he sold the stationary mortar, but not portable ones, the lower millstone but the hopper (which collects flour), not an oven, and not a stove.  When he (the seller) said to him, (I am selling) it and everything within it, behold all of them are sold.
Daled: One who sold a courtyard, he sold houses, holes, trenches, and caves (in the courtyard), but not movable objects.  When he (the seller) said to him, (I am selling) it (the courtyard) and everything within it, behold all of them are sold.  Either way, he did not sell a bathhouse or olive press which is in it.  Rabi Eliezer says, one who sells a courtyard, he did not sell other than the air of the courtyard.
Hay: One who sells an olive press he sold the sea (a large vat), the pressing stone, and the virgins (support beans).  But, he did not sell the pressing logs, the wheel, or the beam.  And when he said to him, it and everything within it, behold all of them are sold.  Rabi Eliezer says, one who sells an olive press, he sold the beam.
Vav: One who sold a bathhouse did not sell the floorboards, benches, or the curtains.  When he said to him, it and everything in it, behold all of them are sold.  Either way, he did not sell the water cisterns and not the (fire) woodsheds.
Zayin: One who sells a city sold the houses, the holes, trenches, caves, bathhouses, dovecotes, olive presses, irrigated field, but not movable objects.  When he said to him, it and everything in it, even if there were animals and slaves in it, behold they are all sold.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, one who sold a city sold the guard (even if he did not sell slaves with the city).
Chet: One who sells a field sold the stones which are for its use (as a fence), the reeds in the vineyard which are for its use (as trellises), the produce which is connected to the ground, a reed fence which is less than the space of a rova, the guard hut which is not made with mortar (is makeshift), a carob which has not been grafted (onto another tree), and the virgin (young, untrimmed) sycamore.
Tet: But, he (one who sells a field) did not sell the stones which are not for its use, not the reeds in a vineyard which are not for its use, and not the produce which is separated from the ground.  When he said to him, it and everything which is in it, behold all of them are sold.  Either way, he did not sell a reed fence which is the space of a rova, not a guard hut which is made with mortar, not a grafted carob (which is now considered a significant entity), not a full grown sycamore, not a hole, not a winepress, not a dovecote, whether they (the last three) are destroyed (abandoned) or settled (in use).  And he must buy for himself (rights to) a path (that is on the property and leads to something not included in the sale) according to Rabi Akiva.  The Chachamim say, he does not need to.  And Rabi Akiva admits, when he (the seller) said to him, except for these (the listed things) he does not need to by a path.  If he (an owner) sold them (the excluded things) to another, Rabi Akiva says, he (the other) does not need to buy for himself the path, but the Chachamim say he needs to by for himself the path.  What is this (all the exceptions to sales) talking about?  With one who sells, but one who gives as a gift he gives all of them.  Brothers who divided (as an inheritance), the one who merited in the field merited in all of them.  One who grasps (makes a chazaka) on the property of a convert (who died without heirs), he grasped all of them.  One who makes a field hekdesh (property designated for temple use), he made them all hekdesh.  Rabi Shimon says, one who makes a field hekdesh, he did not makes hekdesh other than the grafted carob and the full grown sycamore.
