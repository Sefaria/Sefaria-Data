Aleph: One who divorces his wife and says to her, behold you are allowed to everyone except to so-and-so, Rabi Eliezer allows (her to marry, for he considers this a complete get and the condition invalid) and Chachamim forbid (her to marry, for by retaining control with the condition, he made the get incomplete).  What should he do?  He should take it (the get) from her and return and give it to her, and say to her, behold you are allowed to everyone.  But if he wrote it (the condition) in it (the text of the get), even if he went back and erased it, it is invalid.
Bet: (If a man said to his wife while divorcing her), behold you are allowed to everyone except to my father and your father, to my brother and your brother, to a slave, a non-Jew, and to all who she cannot be engaged to, it is valid.  (If he said,) behold you are allowed to everyone, except (if you are) a widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee and a chalutza to a lay kohen, a mamzeret and a netina to a yisra’el, a bat yisra’el to a mamzer and a natin, and to all who she has engagement even in transgression, it is invalid.
Gimmel: The body (text) of a get (says), behold you are allowed to everyone.  Rabi Yehuda says (the body is), and this shall be for you from me, a book of divorce, a letter of release, and a document of exemption, to go and marry any man you want.  The body of a document of release, behold you are a freedwoman, behold you are for yourself.
Daled: Three gittin are invalid, but if she married, the children are valid (and not mamzerim), a get in his (the husband’s) handwriting with no witnesses on it (for the Chachamim do not hold like Rabi Meir that his handwriting is like witnesses), if it has witnesses but no date, or if it has a date but only one witness, behold these three gittin are invalid, but if she married the children are valid.  Rabi Eliezer says, even if there are not witnesses but he gave it to her in front of witnesses, it is valid, and she collects (her ktuba even) from mortgaged property (meaning the get is fully valid), for the witnesses do not sign on the get except form (only for) the public interest.
Hay: Two who sent two identical gittin and they got mixed up, he gives both to this on and both to that one, therefore, if one of them got lost, behold the other is invalid (for it cannot know for sure that we gave either given wife a get).  Five who wrote a joint get (for all of their wives), the man so-and-so divorces so-and-so, and so-and-so (divorces) so-and-so (etc.), and the witnesses are below, they are all valid and they give to each one.  If there was a tofes (standard text) for each one and the witnesses were below, the one the witnesses are read with (the last get) is valid (but the others aren’t).
Vav: Two gittin which were written one next to the other, and two Ivri witnesses (who would sign their names in Hebrew) come from under this one to under that one (their names under the right get and their fathers’ names under the left get), or two Greek witnesses come (who write left to right) come from under this one to under that one (their names under the left and their fathers’ names under the right get), the one which the witnesses (their names) are first read with them is valid.  If one witness is an Ivri an one is Greek and they come under this one to under that one, they are both invalid.
Zayin: If he left part of the get and wrote it on a second paper, and the witnesses are below (the end of the get), it is valid.  If the witnesses signed at the top of the page, on the side, or on the other side in a simple get (unfolded) it is invalid.  If he put the beginning of this one next to the beginning of that one (wrote a get from the middle of the page up and then from the middle down), and the witnesses are in the middle, they are both invalid.  If the end of this is next to the end of this, and the witnesses are in the middle, that which the witnesses are read with it is valid.  If the beginning of this is next to the end of that, and the witnesses are in the middle, that which the witnesses are read with is valid.
Chet: A get which is written Ivrit (in Hebrew) and its witnesses are Greek, or in Greek and its witnesses are Ivrim, one of the witnesses is Ivri and on Greek, the sofer wrote and (acted as) a witness, it is valid.  So-and-so is a witness (without his father’s name) it is valid.  The son of so-and so (without specifying their first names).  So-and-so the son of so-and-so, and he did not write, a witness, he is valid.  And this is how those who were clean in thought in Yerushalauim would do.  If his husband or wife wrote it, it is a vslid.  A forced get, by a yisra’el it is valid, but by goyim it is invalid.  And with non-Jews they beat them and say to them, do what the Jews tell you, and it’s valid.
Tet: If a rumor went out in the town that she was engaged, behold she is engaged, divorced, if (there is a tumor that) she is divorces, behold she is divorced, as long as there is no reason to question (the rumor).  What is a plausible reason to question?  The man so-and-so divorced his wife on condition, he threw her her engagement and it’s a doubt whether it was closer to her or closer to him, this is a plausible reason to doubt.
Yud: Beit Shamay says, a man may not divorce his wife unless there is something inappropriate (with her), as it says, “if he found in her an inappropriate thing.”  Beit Hillel says, even if she spoils his dish (of food), as it says, “if he found in her an inappropriate thing.”  Rabi Akiva says, even if he found another who is more pleasant than her, as it says, “and it will be is she does not find favor in his eyes.
