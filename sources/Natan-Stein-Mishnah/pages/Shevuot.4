Aleph: An oath of a witness (testimony) works by (is valid with) a man but not a woman, a non-relative but no a relative, a valid witness but not an invalid witness, and it only works with those fit to testify, before whether before a court or not before a court, and from his own mouth (willingly).  If it is from the mouth of others, they are not liable (as forced) until they are nullified in court according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, whether it is from his mouth or from others’ mouth, he isn’t chayav until it is nullified before a court.
Bet: One is chayav for intentional (transgression of) an oath or if they accidentally (transgressed) but (denied testifying) intentionally, but aren’t chayav on accidentally (doing both).  And what are they chayav for on intentionally (violating) oaths?  A graded korban.
Gimmel: What is the oath of testimony?  He said to two, come and testify, they swear that they don’t know any testimony for him, or that they said to him, we don’t have testimony for you and he says, I make a swear for you, to which they respond amen, these are chayav.  If he made them swear five times out of court and they came to court and admitted, they are patur.  If they denied (in court that they have testimony) they are chayav on each one.  If he made them swear five times in court and they denied they are only chayav on one.  Rabi Shimon said, why?  Since they can’t go back and admit.
Daled: If both of them denied at once, they are both chayav, if one after another, the first is chayav and the second is patur.  If one denied and one admitted, the denier is chayav.  If there were two sets of witnesses and the first denied and then the second denied, they are both chayav, for the testimony could stand with the two of them (who make up on set).
Hay: I make you swear to come and testify that I have in the hand of so-and-so collateral, a loan, a stolen object, and a lost object of mine, they swear that don’t know any testimony for him, they are only chayav one.  If they swear that they don’t know testimony for him that so-and-so has collateral, a loan, a stolen object, and a loan, they are chayav on each one.  I make you swear to come and testify that so-and-so has collateral of wheat, barley, and spelt, they swear that they don’t know testimony for him, they are only chayav one.  If they swear that they don’t have testimony for him that so-and-so doesn’t have collateral of wheat, barley, and spelt, they are chayav on each one.
Vav: I make you swear that you won’t come and testify that I have from the hand of so-and-so damage and half-damage (from a forewarned and unforewarned ox, respectively), restitution of double, restitution of four and five times, that so-and-so raped my daughter, or seduced my daughter, that my son hit me, that my friend wounded me (on Yom Kippur), and that they lit my pile of grain on Yom Kippur, these are chayav.

Chet: I make you swear that you won’t come and testify that so-and-so said he would give me 200 zuz and he didn’t give me, they are patur, for they aren’t chayav in a claim about money like a collateral.
Tet: I make you swear that when you know testimony for me, you will come and testify, they are patur, for the swear came before the (having of the) testimony.
Yud: He stood in shul and said, I make you swear that if you know testimony for me that you must come and testify for me, they are patur, until he intends for them (specifically).
Yud Aleph: He said to two, I make you swear so-and-so and so-and-so that if you know testimony for me you will come an testify, a swear that we don’t know for you testimony and they know testimony for him as witnesses from the mouth of witnesses or one of them was a relative or invalid, they are patur.

With the names of aleph daled (adoshem) or yud hay (the four-letter name), with Shaday, Tzva’ot, Gracious and Merciful, Long-suffering and Great in kindness and in all substitutes, they are chayav.  One who curses by any of them is chayav according to Rabi Meir and Chachamim exempt.  One who curses his father and mother with any of them is chayav according to Rabi Meir and Chachamim exempt.  One who curses himself and his friend in any of them transgresses a lo ta’ase.  Elokim will smite you or Elokim will smite you like this, this is what the torah spoke of (as forcing a swear).  He won’t smite you, He will bless you, and He will make good for you, Rabi Meir makes chayav and Chachamim exempt.
