Aleph: A house and an upper room of two (owners) which fell, the two of them split the wood, stones, and earth (which are still usable) and they see which stones are fit to break.  If one of them recognizes some of the stones, he takes them and they count as part of the calculation.
Bet: A house and an upper room of two, if the upper room was broken and the owner of the house did not want to fix it, behold the owner of the upper room goes down and lives below until he (the homeowner) fixes the upper room for him.  Rabi Yossi says, the lower (owner, of the house) gives the ceiling, and the upper (owner, of the room) gives the pavement (for the floor).
Gimmel: A house and an upper room of two which fell down, if the owner of the upper room told the owner of the house to build (the house back up) and he doesn’t want to build, behold the owner of the upper room builds the house and lives in it until he (the owner of the house) gives him his expenses (back).  Rabi Yehuda says, also this one who lives in his friend’s (property) must give him rent, rather the owner of the upper room builds the house and the upper room, puts a roof over the upper room, and sits (lives) in the house until he gives him his expenses.
Daled: And so too an olive press which is built in a rock (a hill), there is a garden on it, and it broke.  Behold the owner of the garden goes down and sows below until he makes arches for his olive press (to support the garden).  A wall or a tree which fell into the public domain and damaged, he is patur from paying.  If they gave him time to cut the tree or dismantle the wall, and they fell within the (allotted) time, he is patur, but after the time, he’s chayav.
Hay: One whose wall was next to his friend’s garden and it fell, he (the owner of the garden) said to him, clear away your stones, and he says, they are yours, we do not listen to him.  After he (the owner of the garden) agreed (to remove the stones) he (the owner of the wall) said to him, here is for your expenses, and I will take what is mine, we do not listen to him.  One who hires a worker to do with him in hay and straw, and said to him, give me my wage, and he said, take what you made for your wage, we do not listen to him.  Once he accepted upon himself, here is your wage and I will take what is mine, we do not listen to him.  One who takes out manure to the public domain, the one who takes out takes out, and the one who fertilizes (which can be anyone) fertilizes (may take the manure).  One may not soak mortar in the public domain, and one may not form bricks, but one may knead mortar in the public domain bur not bricks.  One who builds in the public domain, the one who brings stones brings, and (whoever) builds, build (anyone may take the stones), and if it damaged, he (the one who brought the stones) pays what it damaged.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, also he (the builder) may fix (materials for) his work within thirty days (of building and use the public domain).
Vav: Two gardens one above the other, and the vegetables are between them, Rabi Meir says, they are of the upper (garden).  Rabi Yehuda says, of the lower).  Rabi Meir said, if the upper wanted to take his earth, there would be no vegetable (that would grow) here.  Rabi Yehuda said, if the bottom wanted to fill in the garden, there is no vegetable here.  Rabi Meir said, since either one can stop each other, we see from where this vegetable grows.  Rabi Shimon says, all which the upper can stretch his hand and take, behold it it his, and the rest is of the bottom.
