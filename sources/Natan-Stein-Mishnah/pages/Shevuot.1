Aleph: There are two shvuot (oaths) which are four.  There are two laws of knowing of tuma, which are four.  Carrying on Shabbat is by two (laws), which are four.  The signs of afflictions are two, which are four.
Bet: Whenever there is knowledge at the beginning (of doing an act while impure which requires purity) and the end, and unknowing in between, this is in a (korban) which may go up or down in value (based on the means of the bringer).  If there was knowledge at the beginning, but not the end, the goat which is offered inside (the holy of holies) on Yom Hakippurim suspends it until he becomes aware and brings a (korban) which may go up or down in value.
Gimmel: If there was no knowledge at the beginning, but there was at the end, the goat done outside on Yom Hakippurim atones, as it says, “besides the chatat of atonement.”  One what this atones for that atones for, just as the inner one only atones for something upon which there was knowledge, so too the outer only atones for something which had no knowledge.
Daled: One what there is no knowledge at the beginning and the end, the goats of the festivals and of Rosh Chodesh atones, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Shimon says, the goats of the festivals atone, but not the goats of Rosh Chodesh.  And for what do the goats of Rosh Chodesh atone?  For a tahor person who ate something tame.  Rabi Meir says, all of the goats have the same atonement for contaminating the Beit Hamikdash and its holy things.  Rabi Shimon used to say, the goats of Rosh Chodesh atone for a tahor person who ate something tame, those of the festivals atone for one who has no knowledge at both beginning and end, and of Yom Hakippurim atones for what had no knowledge in the beginning but had in the end.  They said to him, may they bring one (goat) set aside for one day on another?  He said to them, they may offer it.  They said to him, since their atonement isn’t the same, why can they offer this for this?  He said to them, they all come to atone for one who contaminates the Beit Hamikdash and its holy things.
Hay: Rabi Shimon ben Yehuda says in his name, the goats of Rosh Chodesh atone for a tahor person who ate something tame, they are added to with those of the festivals, for they atone for a tahor person who ate something tame and for one who had knowledge neither at the beginning nor at the end.  They are added to with those of Yom Hakippurim, for they atone for a tahor person who ate something tame, for one who had knowledge neither at the beginning nor the end, and for one who had no knowledge at the beginning, but did have in the end.  They said to him, may they offer one in the place of the other?  He said to them, he may.  They said to him, if so, those of Yom Hakippurim could be brought on Rosh Chodesh, but how can those of Rosh Chodesh be brought on Yom Hakippurim to atone for something that isn’t its (to atone for)?  He said to them, they all come to atone for a tahor person who ate something tame.
Vav: And for (one who) willingly contaminated the Beit Hamikdash and its holy things, the inner goat of Yom Hakippurim and Yom Hakippurim atone.  And on the rest of the transgressions which are in the torah, a positive or negative commandment, those punishable by karet, and those punishable by death at the hands of the court, the scapegoat atones.
Zayin: Whether a Yisra’el, a kohen, or an anointed kohen (these atonements hold).  What is the difference between a Yisra’el, a kohen, and an anointed kohen.  Only that the blood of the bull atones on the kohanim who made the Beit Hamikdash and its holy things tame.  Rabi Shimon says, just as the blood of the inner goat atones for Yisra’elim, so too the blood of the bull atones for the kohanim.  Just as the confession of the scapegoat atones for a Yisra’el, so too the confession of the bull atones for the kohanim.
