Aleph: All the roofs of a town are one domain, as long as one isnâ€™t ten tfachim higher or lower according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, each one is its own domain.  Rabi Shimon says, whether roofs, courtyards, or enclosed storage areas (for lumber and the like) are one domain for vessels which spent Shabbat  within them, but not vessels which spent Shabbat inside the house.
Bet: A large roof which is next to a small roof, the large is mutar and the small is assur.  A large courtyard which (has a) hole (in the fence adjoining) a small one, the large is mutar and the small is assur, since it is like an entrance for the large one.  A courtyard which has a hole to the public domain, one who takes from it (the public domain) to the private domain or one who takes from the private domain to it is chayav according to Rabi Eliezer.  Chachamim say, from in it to the public domain, or from the public domain into it is patur, since it is like a karmelit.
Gimmel: A courtyard which had a hole to the public domain from two directions, and so too a house which had a hole in two directions, and so too a mavoy which its kora or lechi have been taken, they are mutar that Shabbat and assur for the future (Shabbatot) according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Yossi says, if they are mutar for that Shabbat, they are mutar for the future, and if they are assur for the future, they are assur for that Shabbat.
Daled: One who builds an upper room on top of two houses, and so too bridges which have thoroughfares, one may carry under them on Shabbat according to Rabi Yehuda, and Chachamim prohibit.  And furthermore said Rabi Yehuda, one may make an eruv from a mavoy that is a thoroughfare, and Chachamim prohibit.
