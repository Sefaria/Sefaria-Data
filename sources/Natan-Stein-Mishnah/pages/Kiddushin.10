Aleph: One who keeps a sheep in a temporary pen and locks before it properly, but it went out and damaged, he’s patur.  If he did not lock before it properly, and it went out and damaged, he’s chayav.  If it broke out at night (when we do not expect him to go find it) or if bandits broke it out and it went out and damaged, he’s patur.  If the bandits took it out, the bandits are chayav.
Bet: If he left it (the sheep) in the sun (where it might act unnaturally due to the heat), or he handed it over to a deaf-dumb, a mentally infirm person, or a minor (to guard), and it went out and damaged, he’s chayav (for he was negligent).  If he handed it over to a shepherd, the shepherd enters in his place.  If it fell into a garden (it was being guarded on a roof and fell into someone else’s garden) and benefited, he pays what it benefited (how much he saved by not having to feed it).  If it went down as is normal (it was going along normally and then went into someone’s garden) and damaged, he pays what it damaged.  How does he pay what it damaged?  They evaluate a beit se’ah (the area in which a se’ah of seed is sown) in that field how much it was worth, and how much it is worth (now that it has been damaged).  Rabi Shimon says, if it ate finished (ripe) fruit, he pays finished fruit, if (it ate) a se’ah (he pays) a se’ah, if two se’ah, two se’ah.
Gimmel: One who makes piles of grain in his friend’s field without permission and an animal of the owner of the field ate them, he (the owner of the animal) is patur.  But if it (the animal) was damaged by them, the owner of the pile of grain is chayav, but if he made piles of grain with permission, the owner of the field is chayav.
Daled: One who sends fire in the hand of a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, or minor, (and it ignites something) is patur in the laws of man (from payment) but is chayav in the laws of heaven.  If he sent in the hand of a person of sound senses, the person of sound senses is chayav.  If one brings the fire and (then) one brings the wood (which ultimately led to the fire damage) the one who brought the wood is chayav.  If one brings the wood and (then) one brings the fire, the one who brought the fire is chayav.  If another came and blew it ablaze, the one who blew it ablaze is chayav.  If the wind blew it ablaze, all are patur.  One who sends (forth) a blaze and it ate (burnt) wood, stones, or earth, he’s chayav, as it says, “if a fire goes forth and finds thorns, a pile of grain is eaten, the standing grain, or the field, the one who set the blaze shall pay (for) the (property which is) burnt.”  If it (the fire) passed (over) a fence four amot high, a public path, or a river, he’s patur.  One who lights within his (property), how far can the fire pass (before he becomes patur)?  Rabi Elazar ben Azaria says, we see it as if it is the middle of a beit kor.  Rabi Eliezer says, sixteen amot, like the way (length needed to declare) of the public domain.  Rabi Akiva says, fifty amah.  Rabi Shimon says, “the one who set the blaze shall pay the burnt,” all goes according to the fire.
Hay: One who lights a pile of grain and there were vessels in it and they lit, Rabi Yehuda says, he pays what was in it.  Chachamim say, he only pays a pile of wheat or barley (the value of the volume of the pile, as if the vessels were grain).  If a kid was tied to it or a slave was next to it and burned too, he’s chayav.  If a slave was tied to it or a kid was next to it, he’s patur (killing the slave incurs death and the animal could have escaped).  And the Chachamim admit to Rabi Yehuda with one who lights a building, that he pays everything that is in it, for it is the way of people (normal) to put things inside a building (and it is to be expected).
Vav: A spark which went out from under the hammer (of a blacksmith) and damaged, he’s chayav.  A camel which was loaded with flax, passed in the public domain, its flax entered into a shop, lit on the candle of the shopkeeper, and burned a building, the owner of the camel is chayav.  If the shopkeeper left his candle outside, the shopkeeper is chayav,  Rabi Yehuda says, in a light of Chanukka he is patur (for it is a mitzva to leave it where people can see it).
