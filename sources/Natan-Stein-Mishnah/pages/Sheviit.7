Aleph: There is an important principle they said about shvi’it, anything that is edible, fodder, dyestuff, and doesn’t stay good when left in the ground, it has the laws of shvi’it, and its proceeds hava the laws of shvi’it, it has to be burned after it is out of season (biur) as does its proceeds.  What are these?  Leaves of wild luf, mint leaves, chicory, leeks, portulac, and milkweed.  And fodder?  (Even to) thorns and thistles.  And dyestuff?  After-growth of woad and madder.  They and their proceeds have the laws of shvi’it and biur.
Bet: And they said another principle, whatever isn’t edible, fodder, dyestuff, and does keep when left in the ground, it as the laws of shvi’it as does its proceeds, but neither it nor its proceeds has biur.  What are these? The roots of wild luf, mint roots, hart’s tongue, milkweed root, and hazelwort.  And dyestuff?  Dyer’s madder and sowbread, the laws of shvi’it as does its proceeds, but neither it nor its proceeds has biur.  Rabi Meir says, its proceeds have biur until Rosh Hashana.  They said to him, they don’t have biur, so their proceeds obviously don’t have biur.
Gimmel: Peels of pomegranates and their blossoms and shells of nuts and their kernels have the laws of shvi’it, as do their proceeds.  The dyer may dye for his needs, but not for a pay, for you can’t trade with produce of shvi’it, and not with first-born animals (bechor), truma, an animal that died of natural causes, torn flesh, sheketz, or remes.  And one may not take produce from a field and sell it in the market, but he can harvest and have his son sell on his behalf.  If he took for himself and some happened to be left over, he may sell it.
Daled: One bought a bechor for his son’s wedding or the festival, and didn’t end up needing it, he may sell it.  Hunters of wild animals, fowl, and fish, when they happen upon tame species, they may sell them.  Rabi Yehuda says, even anyone who randomly found these may sell, as long as this isn’t his trade.  And Chachamim forbid it.
Hay: Fronds of the service-tree and carobs have the laws of shvi’it, as do their proceeds, and they and their proceeds have biur.  Fronds of terebinth, pistachio, and white thorn have the laws of shvi’it, as do their proceeds, but neither they nor their proceeds has biur, but the leaves do have biur, because they fall off the stem.
Vav: The rose, cypress, balsam, and lotus have shvi’it, as do their proceeds.  Rabi Shimon says, balsam doesn’t have shvi’it, because it’s not a fruit (it’s a resin).
Zayin: A new rose that has been preserved in old oil (during shvi’it), the rose may be taken out (and the oil is not subject to biur).  If it’s an old rose in new oil (during motzei shvi’it), it is chayav in biur.  New carobs preserved in old wine and old in new are chayav by biur.  This is the general rule, anything which gives flavor, one has to do biur if the thing is not in its own type (and got flavor).  If it is the same type (e.g. shvi’it oil in old oil), any amount makes it chayav biur.  Shvi’it forbids anything of the same type, but for different types, only something which imparts flavor.
