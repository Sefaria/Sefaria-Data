Aleph: Ma’aser sheni (money) may be used to buy for food, for drink, and for anointing, for eating that which is usually eating, and for anointing something which is usually anointed.  One may not anoint with wine or vinegar, but he may with oil.  One may not spice ma’aser sheni oil.  One may not buy spiced oil with ma’aser sheni money, but one may spice (ma’aser sheni) wine.  If honey or spice fell into it (wine) and improved its value, the increased value is calculated according to the proportion (of worth of the components).  Fish which were cooked with leeks of ma’aser sheni and increased in value, the increased value is calculated according to the proportion.  Ma’aser sheni dough which was baked (with chulin wood) and increased in value, the increase in value is all in ma’aser sheni.  This is the general rule, anywhere the increase is recognizable in the finished product is by proportion, but anywhere the increase isn’t recognizable in the final product, it is all for ma’aser sheni.
Bet: Rabi Shimon says, one may not anoint with ma’aser sheni oil in Yerushalayim, and Chachamim allow.  They said to Rabi Shimon, if we are lenient by truma (we allow a kohen to anoint himself in it), which is stringent, shouldn’t we be lenient by ma’aser sheni which is lenient?  He said to them, it’s not so, if we’re lenient by truma, which is strict, where we were lenient by certain aspects of vetches and fenugreek, should we be lenient in the lenient ma’aser sheni, where they were not lenient with vetches and fenugreek?
Gimmel: Fenugreek of ma’aser sheni must be eaten while still sprouting, but of truma, Beit Shamay says one must do anything with it in a tahor state, except for wash his head (it is no longer food then) and Beit Hillel says one must do anything with it in a tame state, except dip it in water (making it tame from him).
Daled: Ma’aser sheni vetches must be eaten while still sprouting, and may enter and leave Yerushalayim.  If they become tame, Rabi Tarfon says they must be divided amongst doughs (so that none contains more than a kzayit), and Chachamim say, you redeem it.  And of truma, Beit Shamay says, they must be soaked and rubbed when tahor, and fed (to animals) when tame.  Beit Hillel says, one soaks while tahor, and rubs and feeds while tame.  Shamay says, they must be eaten dry.  Rabi Akiva says, all of the actions are done in tuma.
Hay: Chulin money and ma’aser sheni money which were scattered (together), whatever he picks up is for ma’aser sheni, until he picks up the right amount, and the rest is chulin.  If he made a pile and took by the handful, he takes according to proportion.  This is the general rule, what is picked up (one by one) is for ma’aser sheni, what is (picked up) mixed is according to proportion.
Vav: A sela of ma’aser sheni and one of chulin which got mixed up, he must take coins worth a sela and say, the sela of ma’aser sheni, wherever it is, is redeemed on this money, and he takes the nicer of the selas and redeems upon it, since they said, silver may be redeemed with copper when it’s necessary, not to leave it like that but to return it to silver.
Zayin: Beit Shamay says, one may not make his selas into golden dinars, and Beit Hillel allows.  Rabi Akiva said, I made Raban Gamliel and Rabi Yehoshua’s money into golden dinars.
Chet: One who changes for a sela from ma’aser sheni money, Beit Shamay says, he may change a whole sela (he won’t need copper before Yerushalayim).  Beit Hillel says, a shekel (half a sela) of silver and half of copper (so that he will be able to buy upon entering, and so that the moneychangers won’t have an influx of silver and make copper prices go up, causing ma’aser sheni to be lost).  Rabi Meir says, one may not change a shekel and produce (jointly) for a sela, but the Chachamim allow.
Tet: One who exchanges a sela of ma’aser sheni in Yerushalayim, Beit Shamay says, he may change the whole sela, and Beit Hillel says, half silver, half copper.  Ones who judge before the Chachamim say, three silver dinar and one dinar of copper.  Rabi Akiva says, three silver dinar and (the last dinar) one quarter copper.  Rabi Tarfon says, four silver aspers (some part of the last dinar).  Shamay says, let him leave the money in a shop and eat its equivalent.
Yud: One who has some tame sons and some tahor, puts down the sela and says, what the tahor drink, this sela is redeemed for it, so the tahor and tame drink from one jug.
