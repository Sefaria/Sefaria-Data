Aleph: One does not learn of inappropriate relations with three (or more students), the acts of creation with two, or the Chariot with one, unless he is intelligent and understanding of his knowledge.  All who look at four things, it would be fit for him to have not come to this world, (and the four things are) what is up (above the heavens), what is down (below the earth), what is before (creation), and what is after (the end of days).  And all who do not account for the honor of their Master, it would be fit for him to have not come to this world.
Bet: Yossi ben Yoezer says not to lay hands (on a sacrifice on Yom Tov, for doing such requires one to exert all his force), and Yossi ben Yochanan says to lay hands.  Yehoshu’a ben Prachia says not to lay hands.  Nitai the Arbeli says to lay hands.  Yehuda ben Tabay says not to lay hands.  Shimon be Shetach says to lay hands.  Shamaya says to lay hands.  Avtalyon says not to lay hands.  Hillel and Menacham did not disagree, Menachem left, and Shamay replaced him.  Shamay says not to lay hands.  Hillel says to lay hands.  The first (to be mentioned) were nesi’im (community leaders) and the second were heads of the court.
Gimmel: Beit Shamay says, they bring shlamim and do not lay hands, but not olot (on Yom Tov).  Beit Hillel says, they bring shlamim and olot and lay hands.
Daled: Shavuot which falls out on erev Shabbat, Beit Shamay says, the day of slaughtering is after Shabbat, and Beit Hillel says, there is no day of slaughtering after Shabbat, and they agree that if it fell out on Shabbat the day of slaughtering is after Shabbat.  And the kohen gadol does not dress in his garments and eulogy and fasting is mutar so as not to establish the opinion of those who say, Shavuot is after Shabbat.
Hay: One washes hands for chulin (bread), ma’aser (bread), and truma (produce).  And for holy (foods) one immerses (his hands in a mikva).  And for a chatat, (even) if (only) his hands became tame (as in when he touched a torah scroll), his body became tame.
Vav: One who immerses for chulin with the intention of chulin is assur from (eating) ma’aser.  If he immersed for ma’aser and intended for ma’aser, is assur from truma.  If he immersed for truma and intended for truma, he is assur from chatat.  If he immersed for something stringent, he is mutar for something lenient.  If he immersed without intention, it is as if he didn’t immerse.
Zayin: The clothes of an am ha’aretz (have a tuma of) midras for prushim (those who are separate and keep matter of kedusha).  The clothes of prushim are midras for those who eat truma.  The clothes of those who eat truma are midras for (those who eat) kodesh.  The clothes of kodesh are midras for (those who eat) chatat.  Yoseph ben Yoezer was a pious person among the kehuna, and his apron was madras for kodesh.  Yochanan ben Gudgeda would eat kodesh in purity all his days, and his apron was midras for chatat.
