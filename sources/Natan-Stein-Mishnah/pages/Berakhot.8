Aleph: .Here are things where Beit Shamay and Beit Hillel disagree during a meal (Beit Shamay first, through hay) – bless Kiddush first versus bless hagafen first.
Bet: Washing hands first versus mixing wine first.
Gimmel: Wiping your hands on the tablecloth and putting it on the table versus on the seat cushion.
Daled: Cleaning the table first versus doing mayim achronim first.
Hay: Havdala should be ner, hagafen, besamim, havdala, versus ner, besamim, hagafen, havdala.  Also ner should be, shebara me’or ha’esh, versus, bore me’orei ha’esh.
Vav: You don’t bless on the ner or besamim of goyim, the deceased, or avoda zara.  You don’t bless on a ner until it’s lit.
Zayin: If you forgot to bench, Beit Shamay says, go back to where you ate, Beit Hillel says, bench where you remembered.  Until when can he still bench?  Until he digests the food which he ate.
Chet: If wine was brought after the meal, and there is no other wine.  Beit Shamay says drink first, benching doesn’t need wine, and Beit Hillel says bench first and then bless on the wine.  You say amen after a Jew benches, but for a kuti only after you hear the whole bracha.
