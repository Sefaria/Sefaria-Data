Aleph: Just as the waters check her, so too the water checks him (the man she was with will get the same punishment if she drinks), as it says, “and they (the waster) shall enter,” “and they shall enter” (the repetition of the word three times is used to learn this).  Just as she is assur to her husband, so too she is assur to the one who had sex with her, as it says, “she became tame,” “and she became tame,” according to Rabi Akiva.  Rabi Yehoshua said, Zachariah ben Hakatzav would (also) expound like this.  Rabi says, two times it is said in the section, “if she became tame,” “she became tame,” one for her husband and one for the man she had sex with.
Bet: On that day (which refers to the day Rabi Elazar ben Azariah was appointed in place of Raban Gamliel and many halachic disputes were solved) Rabi Akiva expounded, “and any earthenware vessel that one of them (a sheretz) shall fall into, all which is in it will become tame.”  It doesn’t say (“tame”,) will be tame, but rather (“yitma”) will make other things tame.  This teaches on a loaf of second (of tuma, which touched something which touched the sheretz) that it makes the third (food it touches) tame.  Rabi Yehoshua said, who will uncover dust from your eyes (if only you were still alive) Rabi Yochanan ben Zakai?  For you would say, another generation is destined to make the loaf that is third tahor, for there is no pasuk in the torah which makes it tame, and didn’t Rabi Akiva your student bring for it a pasuk from the torah that it is tame, as it says, “all that is within it will become tame.”
Gimmel: On that day Rabi Akiva expounded, “and you shall measure outside the city its eastern end two thousand amot, etc.” and another pasuk  says, “from the wall of the city and outward a thousand amot around.  It cannot say a thousand amot, for it already said two thousand amot, and it cannot say two thousand amot, for it already said a thousand amot, how is it?  One thousand amot is the open space and two thousand amot is the bounds for Shabbat (in which one may walk).  Rabi Eliezer the son of Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, one thousand amot is the open space and two thousand amot is the fields and vineyards (referring to the cities of the levi’im, for the space around them was for them to have fields).
Daled: On that day Rabi Akiva expounded, “then Moshe and Bnei Yisra’el sand this song to Hashem and they said saying.”  There is not need to say, “saying,” so what does, “saying” come to teach us?  It teaches us that Yisra’el would answer after Moshe on everything, as we read Hallel, therefore it says, “saying.”  Rabi Nechemia says, like when they read shma (aloud) and not like when they read Hallel.
Hay: On that day Rabi Yehoshua ben Hurkanos expounded, Iyov did not worship Hashem except out of love, as it says, “they may kill me, in Him (lo) I will trust.”  And still the thing is doubted, I will trust him (if lo is with a vav), or I will not trust him (if lo is with an aleph)?  It comes to teach us (from the pasuk,) “until I die I will not pass my wholesomeness from me,” it teaches that he did out of love (as opposed to fear).  Rabi Yehoshua said, who will uncover the dust from your eyes Raban Yochanan ben Zakai?  For you would expound all your days that Iyov only worshipped Hashem out of fear, as it says, “a man complete and straight, god-fearing, and shunning wicked,” and didn’t Yehoshua the student of your student teach that out of love he did it?
