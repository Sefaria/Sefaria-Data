Aleph: One who set aside for a seed, to use as a sample, for medicine, or moves it to another domain on Shabbat, he is chayav in any amount.  And all (other) people aren’t chayav on it unless it is of the set measurement.  If he returned and brought in, he is only chayav if it is of the set measurement.
Bet: One who carries food and places it on the threshold, whether he returned and brought them out or someone else brought it our, he’s patur, since he didn’t do the melacha in one go.  A basket which is full of fruit  and was put on the outer threshold, even though most of the fruits are outside, he’s patur, until he takes the whole basket out.
Gimmel: One who takes out, whether with his right or his life, in his bosom, one on his shoulder, he’s chayav, for this is how the sons of Kehat carried.  With the back of his hand, his foot, in his mouth, with his elbow, with his ear, with his hair, with a belt opening downward, between his belt and his cloak, on the hem of his cloak, in his shoe, or in his sandal, he is patur, for he didn’t carry the way people carry.
Daled: If one intended to carry (an object tied to his cloak) before him, but he carried it behind him, he’s patur.  If he intended behind him and if came in front of him (and was therefore better guarded), he’s chayav.  They truly said, a woman who wraps in an apron, whether in front or behind, is chayav, for it slips around.  Rabi Yehuda says, even the receivers of edicts (which were carried in a tube on a belt which could move about).
Hay: One who carries a loaf into the public domain is chayav.  If two brought it out, they are patur.  If one (alone) couldn’t take it out and two took it out, he’s chayav, and Rabi Shimon allows it.  One who takes out food less than the set measurement in a vessel, is patur even on the vessel, for the vessel is secondary to it; a live person in a bed, the bed is patur, for the bed is secondary to him; and the dead on a bed, he’s chayav.  And so too a kzayit of a corpse, a kzayit of an animal which died of natural causes, or a lentil sized piece of sheretz, he’s chayav, and Rabi Shimon allows it.
Vav: One who cuts his nails with each other or his teeth, so too with his hair, mustache, beard, a woman who braids, a woman who uses eye shadow, and a woman who parts her hair, Rabi Eliezer makes chayav, and the Chachamim make assur because of shvut (work which while not prohibited, is against the spirit of sanctity and assur derabanan).  One who plucks from a flowerpot with a hole is chayav, and if it doesn’t have a hole, he’s patur.  And Rabi Shimon exempts both.
