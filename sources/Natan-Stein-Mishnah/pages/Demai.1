Aleph: Lists some species we are lenient about dmai with, including wild figs, jujube fruit, and sycamore fruit, and there are some others in Judea.  Rabi Yehuda says all wild figs are exempt except for a type of fig that bears fruit semiannually, all jujube fruits except those from Shikmona, and all young sycamore fruit except those which burst.
Bet: Dmai isn’t subject to chomesh or biur on Pesach, an onen, one who has not yet buried his dead, can eat it, can enter and leave Yerushalayim, you can leave a bit of it on the road, you can feed it to an am ha’aretz, but you have to eat an equivalent amount of your ma’aser sheni, you can de-sanctify redeemed dmai by exchanging silver for silver, copper for copper, silver for copper, or copper for fruit, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say you have to take the fruit to Yerushalayim.
Gimmel: One who takes to seed of as feed, flour for hides, oil for a candle, or oil to grease tools, is patur if it’s dmai.  Kziv or north, it’s not considered Israel, so it’s patur on dmai.  Challa from an am ha’aretz, mixed truma and non-truma, food bought with ma’aser sheni money, and leftovers from a korban mincha are patur from dmai.  Perfumed oil, Beit Shamay says it’s chayav dmai, and Beit Hillel says it’s patur.
Daled: Dmai can be used for an eruv, to join courtyards (such that things may be carried between them), to bench, to make a zimun, can be separated in the nude (since taking ma’aser from it doesn’t need a bracha), and can be separated at dusk.  If you take ma’aser sheni before ma’aser rishon, it doesn’t matter.  Oil which a weaver rubs between his fingers is chayav in dmai, but what the wool-comber puts on the wool is patur in dmai.
