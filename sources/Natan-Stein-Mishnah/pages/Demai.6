Aleph: One who leases a field from a Jew, a non-Jew, or a kuti, may give his payment (for sharecropping) without taking truma or ma’aser.  One who rents from a Jew takes truma and pays.  Rabi Yehuda says, what is this talking about?  When he gives him from the same field and species, but if he gives from a different field or species, he just takes ma’aser and gives it.
Bet: One who rents a field (for a fixed fee) from a non-Jew must take ma’aser before paying.  Rabi Yehuda says, even if the non-Jew’s land used to belong to the Jew’s family, he must take ma’aser.
Gimmel: A kohen or levi who leased from a yisra’el doesn’t take truma.  Rabi Eliezer says, the ma’asrot he takes for himself, because it was an understood clause of the lease.
Daled: A yisra’el who leased from a kohen or levi, the ma’asrot are for the owners.  Rabi Yishma’el says, someone from outside of Yerushalayim who leases from someone inside Yerushalayim gives the ma’aser sheni to the owner.  Chachamim say, the leaser can take the food and eat in Yerushalayim.
Hay: One who leases olive trees and is going to pay in oil doesn’t take ma’asrot.  Rabi Yehuda says, a Yisra’el who did this with a kohen or levi, the owners get the ma’asrot.
Vav: Beit Shamay says, one shouldn’t sell olives to a non-chaver.  Beit Hillel says, you can also sell to someone who takes ma’aser, but the pious among Beit Hillel acted in accordance with Beit Shamay’s opinion.
Zayin: Two people who put their grapes in one wine press, one who takes ma’aser and one who doesn’t, the one who takes ma’aser should take, and half of what he takes is considered dmai (and he should take ma’asrot accordingly).
Chet: Two people (only one of whom takes ma’asrot) who sharecropped together, inherited together, or became partners in a field, the one who takes ma’asrot can say, you take part of this crop, and I will take the other part, but he cannot say, you take this crop and I will take that, for that is like trading tevel to an am ha’aretz.
Tet: A chaver and an am ha’aretz who inherited from their father, an am ha’aretz, follow the same rules as two random people.
Yud: A convert and a goy who inherited from their father, a goy, can cut a deal using forbidden items, i.e. saying you take the idols and I take the money.  But if the ger took possession of these items, he may not use them to barter.
Yud Aleph: One who sells fruits in Syria and says they are from Israel has to take ma’aser (even though it would normally be exempt from the laws of dmai).  If he says they are me’usar, we believe him, for the same person made them assur and mutar.  If a Jew says, they are from my field in Syria, they are dmai.  If he says they are me’usar, we believe him.  If the seller is known to have a field in Syria, even if he says nothing they’re dmai.
Yud Bet: If an am ha’aretz asked a chaver to buy him a bundle of vegetables or a fine loaf of bread, the chaver can buy without taking care and is patur.  But if he said, this specific piece is for the am ha’aretz and they mixed up, he has to take ma’aser, even if it’s outweighed by 100.
