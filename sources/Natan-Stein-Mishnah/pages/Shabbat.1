Aleph: Taking out on Shabbat are two which are four inside and two which are four outside.  How?  A poor person stands outside and the homeowner inside, the poor person puts out his hand, inside, and the homeowner puts something inside his hand or he took from him and took it out, the poor person is chayav and the homeowner is patur.  If the homeowner puts out his hand, outside, and the poor person put something in his hand or he took something from him and took it in, the homeowner is chayav and the poor person is patur.  If the poor person put his hand inside and the homeowner took something from it or out something in it and he (the poor person) took it out, they’re both patur.  If the homeowner puts his hand outside and the poor person took from it or he put something in it and he (the homeowner) brought it in, they’re both patur.
Bet: One should not sit before a barber close to mincha (on erev Shabbat), until he davens.  One should not enter a bathhouse, tannery, nor eat, nor judge.  And if they started they do not stop them.  They stop to read shma, and they do not stop for shmone esray.
Gimmel: The tailor should not take out his needle close to when it darkens, lest he forget and go out, and the scribe does not go with his pen.  One may not search his garments (for lice) or read by the light of a candle.  They truly said, the chazzan (a teacher) may see where the children read, but he may not read.  Likewise, a zav may not eat with a zava, for habit (leads to) sin.
Daled: And these are from the laws which they said in the upper chamber of Chanania ben Chizkiya ben Gurion when they went up to visit him, they counted and declared that Beit Shamay was greater (in number) than Beit Hillel, and they decreed eighteen things on that day.
Hay: Beit Shamay says, one does not soak (on Friday) in ink, dyes, and vetches, unless it’s to dye for that day, and Beit Hillel allows.
Vav: Beit Shamay says, one may not put bundles of flax into an oven, unless they will be steamed that day, and (one may) not put wool into a pot (of boiling dye) unless it will gather the appearance (that day) and Beit Hillel allows.  Beit Shamay says, one may not set traps for animals, birds, or fish except to trap that day, and Beit Hillel allows.
Zayin: Beit Shamay says, one may not sell to a non-Jew (on Friday), one does not load (an animal) with him, and one does not lift on him (a load which he is carrying), unless he is going to a nearby place, and Beit Hillel allows.
Chet: Beit Shamay says, one doesn’t give hides to a leatherworker and not vessels (clothes) to a non-Jewish washer, unless they do that day.  And Beit Hillel allows all of them with the sun (still up).
Tet: Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, they were accustomed in the house of my father to give white vessels (clothes, which were hard to clean) to the non-Jewish cleaners three days before Shabbat.  And both of these agree that one may load the beams of an olive press (so the oil will be extracted over Shabbat) and the cylinders of a wine press (to further squish the grapes over Shabbat).
Yud: One may not roast meat, onion, or egg unless they will be roasted that day.  One may not put bread in the oven with (the onset of) darkness, and not charara (a type of cake baked) on coals, unless their surface will crust that day.  Rabi Eliezer says, enough for their bottom to become crusted.
Yud Aleph: One may put the korban pesach down into the oven with nightfall, and one may kindle the fire in a bonfire of Beit Hamoked (a fire in the Beit Hamikdash to warm the kohanim) and in the country, (they may only kindle) if most of them will catch fire.  Rabi Yehuda says, with charcoal, any amount (if lie makes it mutar).
