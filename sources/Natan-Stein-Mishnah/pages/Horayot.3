Aleph: An anointed kohen who sinned and then passed from his anointment (was replaced in his appointment), and so too a nasi who sinned and then passed from his greatness, the anointed kohen brings a bull and the nasi brings a goat.
Bet: An anointed kohen who passed from his anointment and then sinned, and so too a nasi who passed from his greatness and then sinned, the anointed kohen brings a bull and the nasi (brings) like a layman.
Gimmel: If they sinned before they were appointed and they were appointed, behold they are like laymen.  Rabi Shimon says, if they were informed (of their sin) before they were appointed, they are chayav (like a layman), and after they are appointed, they are patur.  Which is a nasi?  This is the king, as it says, “and he shall do on of all of the mitzvot of Hashem his God,” it (is referring) to a nasi who has nothing above him other than God.
Daled: And which is an anointed one?  One who anointed with the oil of anointment, not one who is increased in garments (the kohen gadol wore eight garments as opposed to the four of lay kohanim, and after the oil of anointment was hidden, this was their only distinction).  There is nothing (no difference) between a kohen anointed with the oil of anointment and a kohen who is increased in garments other than the bull which comes for all of the mitzvot (as a chatat).  And there is nothing between a kohen who is serving (as kohen gadol) and a kohen who passed (was removed from the position of kohen gadol) other than the bull of Yom Hakippurim and the tenth of the epha (a meal offering on Yom Hakippurim).  This and that are equal in the service of Yom Hakippurim, and are commanded about virgins (they may only marry virgins).  They are assur to a widow, do not become tame for (the death) of their relatives, do not loosen their hair (as a sign of mourning), do not tear their clothes (another sign of mourning), and (their death) returns a killer (who was exiled for killing accidentally).
Hay: A kohen gadol tears his clothes from below (this is an acceptable sign of mourning) and a lay (kohen) from above (the usual way).  A kohen gadol offers when grieving, but does not eat, and a lay (kohen) doe not offer and does not eat.
Vav: Whatever is more frequent than its friend comes before its friend, and whatever is holier than its friend comes before its friend.  If a bull of the anointed (kohen) and a bull of the assembly are standing (to be offered), the bull of the anointed one comes before the bull of the assembly for all of its actions.
Zayin: A man comes before a woman for keeping alive and for returning a lost object, and a woman comes before a man for being clothed and for removal from captivity, but in a time when both of them stand to be defiled (in captivity), the man comes before the woman.
Chet: A kohen comes before a levi, a levi (comes before) a yisra’el, a yisra’el (before) a mamzer, a mamzer (before) a natin, a natin (before) a convert, and a convert (before) a freedman.  When?  When they are all equal, but if the mamzer is a scholar and the kohen gadol is an am ha’aretz (ignoramus), a scholar mamzer comes before a kohen gadol (who is) an am ha’aretz.
