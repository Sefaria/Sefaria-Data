Aleph: Lists some things which when dmai have to have ma’aser taken, including rice.  But rice outside of Israel, whoever uses it is patur from ma’aser.
Bet: One who takes it upon himself to be ne’eman takes ma’aser on what he eats, what he sells, what he buys, and doesn’t stay by an am ha’aretz.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one who stays by an am ha’aretz is a ne’eman.  They said to him, if the person (the host) isn’t ne’eman for himself, why do you think they will be ne’eman for others?
Gimmel: One who takes it upon himself to be a chaver doesn’t sell to an am ha’aretz dry or moist, and doesn’t buy from him moist, and doesn’t stay by an am ha’aretz, and doesn’t have amei ha’aretz over in his own clothes.  Rabi Yehuda says, he doesn’t breed small cattle, take vows often, joke often, does net get tumat met, and becomes a shamash in the beit midrash.  They said to him, yours are not required.
Daled: The Chachamim didn’t require bakers to separate anything other than challa and trumat ma’aser.  Storekeepers may not sell dmai.  Wholesalers can sell dmai.  Who is considered a wholesaler?  Recognized wholesalers and grain sellers.
Hay: Rabi Meir says, one who normally wholesales but sold in small quantity, it goes under his wholesaler status, an ordinary salesman who sold wholesale, it goes under his salesman status.  How big is wholesale?  Dry things is three kav, and moist things worth a dinar.  Rabi Yossi says, baskets of figs, baskets of dates, and boxes of vegetables, as long as they are sold as a lot, they are patur.
