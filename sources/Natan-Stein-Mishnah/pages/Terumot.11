Aleph: One may not put fig cake or dried figs (both truma) into fish brine, because he is spoiling it, but one may put (truma)wine into the brine (to improve the wine).  One may not perfume (truma) oil, but one may make wine into honeyed wine (with chulin honey).  One may not boil truma wine because it reduces it.  Rabi Yehuda allows it, because it improves it.
Bet: Date honey, apple wine, winter-grape vinegar, and all other fruit juices, Rabi Eliezer makes you chayav (if you eat it) the principal and chomesh, and Rabi Yehoshua says you’re patur (from chomesh).  Rabi Yehuda allows them to become tame, because they are liquids (meaning they are treated as food and therefore truma).  Rabi Yehoshua said, Chachamim didn’t count the seven liquids which become tame the same as they counted spices (which weren’t enumerated), rather they said, these seven liquids become tame, and all other liquids are tahor.
Gimmel: One may not make (truma) dates into honey, apples into wine, or winter-grapes into vinegar.  And all other fruits, one does not change from how it was made if truma or ma’aser rishon, except for olives and grapes.  One does not get forty lashes because of orla (liquids) except for products of olives and grapes.  One may not brink liquid bikurim except for olive and grape products.  Liquids don’t become tame except for olive and grape products (and the seven liquids).  And one does not bring up on the mikdash except for olive and grape products.
Daled: The twigs of figs, dried figs, klisim (a carob-like fruit), and carobs of truma are assur to zarim.
Hay: Seeds of truma, when one (kohen) keeps them, they are assur, but if he throws them away, they are mutar (to zarim).  So too, the bones of holy things if he keeps them, they are assur, but if he throws them away, they’re mutar.  Coarse bran is permitted.  Fine bran of new (fruit) is forbidden, but of old is permitted (to zarim).  And he deals with truma in the same way as chulin (i.e. he is not destroying truma).  One who sifts one or two kav from a se’ah (six kav) may not throw out the rest, rather he should put it in a hidden place.
Vav: A storeroom from which one cleared out truma wheat (to make room for chulin), we don’t make him sit and take out grain by grain, rather he sweeps as usual and may fill it with chulin.
Zayin: So too with a barrel of oil that spilled, we don’t make him sit and scoop it up, rather, he treats it as usual, as he treat chulin.
Chet: One who transfers from jar to jar and three drops drip (from the residue in the first jar), he may put chulin into it (the first jar).  If he inclined and drank it, it’s truma.  Hand how much trumat ma’aser of dmai must there be to force him to go to the kohen?  One eight of an eighth.
Tet: Vetchlings of truma, one may feed them to domesticated animals, wild animals, and fowl.  A yisra’el who rented a cow from a kohen, may feed it truma vetchlings, and a kohen who rented a cow from a yisra’el, even though he is responsible for its food, he may not feed it the vetchlings of truma.  A yisra’el who got an appraised cow from a kohen (making it essentially his, but the kohen still gets from the profits) may not feed it truma vetchlings, and a kohen who got an appraised cow from a yisra’el may feed it truma vetchlings.
Yud: One may burn oil which must be burned (tame truma) in a shul, a beit midrash, dark alleys, or for the sick, with the permission of a kohen.  The daughter of a yisra’el who married a kohen and she goes to her father’s house often, her father may light with her permission.  One may light at a wedding, but not in a house of mourning, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Yossi says, in a house of mourning, but not at a wedding.  Rabi Meir forbids in both places.  Rabi Shimon allows in both places.
