Aleph: One may send produce through a trap door on Yom Tov (it he is drying it and it starts to rain), but not on Shabbat.  And one may cover produce with vessels because (of a fear the will get ruined by) a drip, and so too with jugs of wine and jugs of oil.  And one may put a vessel under a drip on Shabbat (to protect the house).
Bet: All which one is chayav for because of shvut (rabbinically declared work), reshut (an optional, pious act which is forbidden by shvut) or mitzva (which is nonetheless assur because of shvut) on Shabbat, one is chayav on them on Yom Tov.  And these are because of shvut, one may not climb a tree, one may not ride an animal, one may not swim on the water, and one may not clap, slap, or dance.  And these are because of reshut, one may not judge, one does not marry, one does not do chalitza (rejecting yibum), and one does not do yibum (having a child with the wife of a deceased brother in his memory).  And these are because of mitzva, one does not make hekdesh (donations to the Beit Hamikdash), one does not vow a value (to the Beit Hamikdash), one does not devote things (for the upkeep of the Beit Hamikdash), and one does not lift out truma and ma’aser.  All of these they said on Yom Tov, and kal vechomer on Shabbat.  There is nothing (no laws different) between Yom Tov and Shabbat except for food.
Gimmel: The animal and the vessel are like the feet of the owner (may only be taken where the owner can walk).  One who gives over his animal to his son or a shepherd, they (the animals) are (still) like the owner’s feet.  Vessels which are especially for (the use of) one of the brothers of the house, they are like his (the brother’s) feet, and which aren’t special (for one person, but for all of them, the place of) these are like (only) a place where they can all walk.
Daled: One who borrows a vessel from his friend from erev Yom Tov, it is like the feet of the borrower, (he borrowed) on Yom Tov, it is like the feet of the lender.  A woman who borrowed from her friend spice, water, and salt, for her dough, these are like the feet of both of them.  Rabi Yehuda exempts in water, for there is no substance in it.
Hay: A hot coal is like the feet of the owners, but a flame (which is insubstantial) can go anywhere.  A coal of hekdesh has me’ila, and a flame, on may not use, and there is no me’ila by it.  One who takes a coal out to the public domain is chayav, and a flame is patur.  (Water from) a private well is like the feet of the owner, and of the people of that town, like the feet of the people of that time, and of those going up from Bavel like the feet of the one who draws.
Vav: One whose produce was in another town, and the people of that town made an eruv to bring him his produce, they may not bring to him, and if he made an eruv, the produce is like him.
Zayin: One who invited over guests, they may not take in their hands gifts, unless he allowed them there gifts from erev Yom Tov.  One may not water of slaughter their field animals, but one may water and slaughter their house animals.  What are those?  Those which sleep in the city.  Wild animal?  Ones who sleeps in the meadow.
