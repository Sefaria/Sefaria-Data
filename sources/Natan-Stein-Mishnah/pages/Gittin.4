Aleph: One who sends a get to his wife (with an agent) and he met up with the messenger (by chance) or he sent a messenger after him and said to him, the get which I sent you is annulled, behold it is annulled.  If he reached his wife first, or he sent a messenger to her and said to her, the get which I sent you is annulled, behold it is annulled.  If it is after the get got to her hand, he cannot still annul it.
Bet: At first, (the husband) would make a court in a different place (not with the wife or messenger) and annul it, but Raban Gamliel the Elder decreed that they would not do such, for the sake of public interest (for example, if the woman does not find out about this provisional court, she may marry and her children will be mamzerim).  At first, he would change his name and her name, the name of his city and the name of her city (when writing the get if they were called something different in the place he was writing the get), but Raban Gamliel the Elder established that he would write, the man so-and-so and all names he has, the woman so-and-so and all names she has, because of public interest.
Gimmel: A widow does not collect from the property of orphans except with an oath (that she has not yet collected anything).  If they refrained from making her take an oath, Raban Gamliel the Elder established that she can vow to the orphans on anything (which was considered less serious than an oath), and she collects her ktuba.  The witnesses (of the get being given) sign the get because of the public interest.  Hillel instituted pruzbol (a document which causes loans to last throughout shvi’it) because of the public interest.
Daled: A slave who was taken captive and redeemed (by a third party), if for the sake of (his being) a slave, he is a slave.  If for the sake of a freedman, he will not be a slave.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, either way, he is a slave.  A slave whose master made him a mortgage to another and (then) freed him, based on the letter of law the slave is not obligated (to the lender) at all.  But, because of the public interest, they force his master (meaning the lender) to make him a freedman, and he (the slave) writes a document for his worth (which replaces him as the mortgage).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, he does not write, rather the one who freed him (the borrower).
Hay: One who is half slave half freedman works for his master one day and himself one day, according to Beit Hillel.  Beit Shamay said to them, you fixed it for the master, but for him you haven’t fixed it, he cannot marry a maidservant for he is already half a freedman, and he cannot marry a free woman, for he is already half a slave, should he refrain (from getting married)?  And behold, wasn’t the world only created for being fruitful and multiplying, as it says, “not wasteful did He create it, to be inhabited He fashioned it.”  Rather, for the purpose of the public interest, they force his master and make him a freedman, and he rights a bill for half of his value.  Beit Hillel returned to agree with the opinion of Beit Shamay.
Vav: One who sells his slave to a non-Jew or to outside of Israel, he (the slave) goes free (because if he has a Jewish owner he may do certain mitzvot).  One does not (have to) redeem captives for more than their value for the public interest (so that people will not learn that it is profitable to kidnap).  And they do not help captives escape for the public interest (so future captives will not be held cruelly).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, because of a decree for captives (the other captives who are being held).  And one does not buy holy books, tfillin, or mezuzot from non-Jews for more than their value, because of the public interest.
Zayin: One exits from (his marriage with) his wife because of a bad name (people believe her to have committed adultery), he may not return (to being married with her).  Because of a vow (which he does not approve of, so he divorces her), he may not return.  Rabi Yehuda says, any vow which is known to the masses, he may not return, but one which is not known to the masses, he may return.  Rabi Meir says, any vow which requires examination from a sage (and cannot simply be annulled by her husband) he may not take her back, but that which does not require examination by a sage he may return.  Rabi Eliezer says, they didn’t forbid this except because of that (they only made the prohibition by the vow that requires examination because of the case of the vow which does not need examination, meaning that that case should also be prohibited).  Rabi Yossi bar Yehuda said, there was a case in Tzidan where one who said to his wide, konam if I don’t divorce you, and he divorced her, and the Chachamim allowed him to return her, because of the public interest.
Chet: One who exits from his wife because (she is) an aylonit (one who is barren), Rabi Yehuda says, he may not return.  Chachamim say, he may return.  If she married another and had children from him, and she claims he ktuba (from the first husband, for an aylonit, which she now clearly isn’t, is not entitled to her ktuba), Rabi Yehuda said, they say to her, your silence is better for you than your speech (for your husband may say he would not have divorced you if he know you were not an aylonit, which could create problems).
Tet: One who sells himself and his children to a non-Jew, they do not redeem him, but they redeem his children after the death of the father.  One who sells his field to non-Jew and a Jew returned and bought it from him, the buyer brings bikurim (even though the produce grew while in the non-Jew’s possession) because of the public interest (so people will realize that land retains its kdusha and will work to buy it back).
