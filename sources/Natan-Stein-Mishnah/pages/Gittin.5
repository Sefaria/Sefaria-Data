Aleph: Those who are damaged (their claim) is assessed (collected) on idit (choice lands), one who is owed one beynonit (land of intermediate quality), and the ktuba of a woman with ziburit (poor quality land).  Rabi Meir says, also the ktuba of a woman with beynonit.
Bet: One does not pay back a claim with mortgaged property (which a third party creditor now possesses) when there is free property, even if they (the free property) are ziburit (despite the fact that the person is entitled to idit).  One does not pay back a claim from the property of orphans except with ziburit.
Gimmel: One does not take out for consumed land (if one bought land which was stolen and the original owner claimed back the land, the one who bought and planted the land claims money for the produce he planted from the thief who sold him the land), improvement of the land (in the same case as above, the buyer claims monies for any improvement made to the property from the original owner), or for maintenance of the wife and daughters (paid by the heirs to the wife and daughters of a dead man) from mortgaged property, because of the public interest (because the person cannot know exactly how much to leave unmortgaged, we do not want those who take things as a mortgage to have fear of losing their property).  And one who finds a lost thing does not swear (that he returned it) because of the public interest (for in the future people will not bother to deal with lost items).
Daled: Orphans who relied on a homeowner or their father appointed a guardian for them, he must tithe their produce.  A guardian who the father of the orphans appointed must swear (that he did not take any property from the estate).  If the court appointed him, he doesn’t swear (for unlike one appointed by the father, he is unpaid, and would not take the job if he had to swear).  Abba Shaul says, it’s the opposite (one appointed by the father is doing it as a kindness to the father, whereas one appointed by the court becomes known as a trustworthy, so he will not hesitate to take the oath).  One who makes (truma) tame, mixes (truma and chulin), or libates (uses wine of avoda zara) accidentally, he is patur (from paying for the loss of usable truma), if intentionally, chayav.  Kohanim who intentionally make pigul (a sacrifice which was intended to be eaten after the allowed time) in the Beit Hamikdash is chayav.
Hay: Rabi Nechunya ben Gudgeda testified about a deaf-dumb woman whose father married her off, that she exits (the marriage) with a get (which she, and not her father, receives), and about a minor bat yisra’el who married a kohen, that she eats truma.  And if she died, her husband inherits her.  And (he testified) about a stolen beam which is built into the palace, that he (the thief) must give its value (and not the beam itself) because of the decree for the repenters (for if thieves have to demolish buildings to return things, they will not return as readily), and about a stolen chatat (a stolen animal used for a chatat), that the public is unaware of, that it does atone, because of the sake of the mizbe’ach (so people are not over careful when bringing korbanot).
Vav: There was no sikrikon (a non-Jew who threatens to kill someone if they do not hand over their land) in Yehuda in the killed of the war (with Titus, for, since there was a decree to kill every Jew, the turnover of land was thought permanent).  From those killed in the war an on, there was sikrikon.  How?  If one bought from a sikrikon and then bought from a homeowner, his sale is null (for the homeowner may have sold figuring he could get it back).  But if he bought from the owner and the bought from the sikrikon, his sale is valid (for the homeowner signed over property independent of the sikrikon).  If one bought from a man and then from the wife, his sale is null (for she may say that she only wanted to sell to please her husband).  If (he bought) from the wife and then from the man, it is valid (for the claim is invalid).  This is the original mishna.  A court after them said, one who buys from a sikrikon gives the owners a fourth.  When?  When they can’t (afford to) buy it.  But if they can buy it, they take precedent over all other people.  Rabi convinced the court and they counted (votes, meaning ruled) that if it sat before the sikrikon twelve months, whoever comes first to buy merits, but he gives the owners a fourth.
Zayin: One who is deaf-dumb may hint and is hinted to (communicate), and Ben Bteira says, he may speak with lips and read lips for (transactions involving only) objects (and not land).  Children (six or seven years old), their purchase is a purchase and their sale is a sale by objects.
Chet: And these are things they said because of the ways of peacefulness, a kohen reads (gets an aliya from the torah) first, a levi after him, and after him a yisra’el because of the ways of peacefulness.  They make an eruv (combined property which allows all owners of parts of a courtyard to carry in the courtyard on Shabbat) in an old house (where they have always done it) because of the ways of peacefulness.  A pit which is closest to a water canal is filled first because of the ways of peacefulness.  Traps for animals, fowl, and fish (taking them or their contents) is treated as theft because of the ways of peacefulness.  Rabi Yossi says, this is actual theft.  The findings of a deaf-dumb, mentally infirm person, and minor (which technically do not belong to them) have theft because of the ways of peacefulness.  Rabi Yossi says, this is actual theft.  A poor person who beats the top of an olive tree (to harvest the olives), whatever is beneath him is theft, because of the ways of peacefulness.  Rabi Yossi says, this is actual theft.  One does not prevent a non-Jew from leket, shichicha, or pe’ah because of the ways of peacefulness.
Tet: A woman may lend her friend who is suspect by shvi’it a sifter, a sieve, a hand-mill, or an oven.  But she may not sift or grind with her.  The wife of a chaver (one who is careful by tithes and tahara) may lend to the wife of an am ha’aretz a sifter or a sieve, and she may separate, grind, or sift with her, but once she has poured water, she can’t touch it, for you don’t help those who are engaged in transgression.  And this was all said because of the ways peacefulness.  One may encourage non-Jews on shvi’it (as in, say good luck), but not a Jew.  And you greet people, out of the ways of peacefulness.
