Aleph: The one in charge said to them, go out and see if the time for slaughtering has come yet.  If it came, the one who sees says, barkai (the dawn has flashed).  Matitya ben Shmu’el says, the entire east is lit up (only then may they slaughter).  (They ask) until Chevron?  And he says, yes (and they slaughter).
Bet: And why did they need this?  Because once the light of the moon rose, they thought the east had lit up, and they slaughtered the tamid and brought it out to the place of burning.  (Before the Yom Hakippurim service) they would lead the kohen gadol to the place of immersion.  This is the general rule that was in the Beit Hamikdash, all who cover their feet (meaning relieve themselves) needs immersion, and all who pass water (urinate) need to sanctify (wash) their hands and feet.
Gimmel: A person may not enter the courtyard for holy work even tahor until he immerses.  Five immersion and ten sanctifications (washings) the kohen gadol does on that day (on Yom Hakippurim) and they are all in the Beit Hamikdash near the house of haparava, except only this one (the first).
Daled: They spread a linen sheet between him and the people.  He would undress, go down, and immerse, and come up and dry himself.  They brought him golden clothing, and he put them on and washed his hands and feet.  They brought him the tamid, he cut it, another finishes the slaughter on his behalf, and he got the blood and sprinkled it.  He entered (the Beit Hamikdash proper) to offer the incense, set the candles, and offer the head, limbs, chavitin, and wine.
Hay: The incense of the morning was offered between the (sprinkling of the) blood and the (offering of the) limbs.  That of bein ha’arbayim (afternoon) was between the limbs and the libations.  If the kohen gadol was old or sensitive, they warm for him hot water and pout it into the cold water (of the mikva) to reduce their coldness.
Vav: They brought him to the house of haparava, which was in the kodesh (holy area).  They spread a sheet of linen between him and the nation, and he washed his hands and feet and undressed.  Rabi Meir says, he undressed and (then) washed his hands and feet.  He went down and immersed and came up and dried off.  They would bring him white clothing, and he put them on and washed his hands and feet.
Zayin: In the morning he would wear plusim (clothing of fine Egyptian linen) of (a value of) twelve maneh, and in the afternoon (he wore) hindvin (clothing on Indian linen) of eight hundred zuz, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, in the morning he wore of eighteen maneh, and in the afternoon (he wore) of twelve maneh, all in all thirty maneh.  These are from (the funds of) the public, and if he (the kohen gadol) wanted to add, he added from his own.
Chet: He (the kohen gadol) came to his bull, and his bull was standing between the hall and the mizbe’ach, its head to the south facing west, and the kohen stands to the east facing west, and he places both of his hands on it and confesses.  He used to say like this, please Hashem I have done wrong, I have been negligent, I have sinned before you, me and my house.  Please Hashem, please atone for the wrongs, the negligences, and the sins which I did wrong, was negligent, and sinned before you, me and my house, as is written in the torah of Moshe your servant, “for on this day he will make atonement upon you etc.”  And they would answer after him, “blessed is His holy name and His kingship for ever and eternity.”
Tet: He came to the east (part) of the courtyard, north of the mizbe’ach, the sgan to his right and the head and the head of his father’s house to the left.  And there were two goats and there was an urn there and in it there were two lots.  They were made of boxwood and Ben Gamla made them out of gold, and they would remember him favorably.
Yud: Ben Katin made twelve spigots for the sink, for it only had two.  And he even made a machine for the sink (a waterwheel or a machine connecting to a cistern) so that its waters wouldn’t become pasul because of leyna (being left over night in a receptacle in the Beit Hamikdash).  Munbaz the king (a king who converted to Judaism) would make all the handles of the vessels for Yom Hakippurim out of gold.  Helena his mother (who also converted) made a golden candlestick for the entrance of the holy area and she also made a golden tablet upon which the parsha of sota was written.  (The) Nikanor (gate)had miracles done to its doors, and they would remember him favorably.
Yud Aleph: And these (were remembered) for unfavorably, those of the house of Garmu, for they didn’t want to teach how to make the showbreads, those of the house of Avtinas, for they didn’t want to teach how to make the incense, Hurgas ben Levi, he knew singing well but would not teach it, and Ben Kamtzar, he didn’t want to teach the wart of writing.  On the first it is written, “remember the righteous in blessing,” and on these it is said, “and the name of the wicked shall rot.”
