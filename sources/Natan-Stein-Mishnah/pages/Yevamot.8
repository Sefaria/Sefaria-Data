Aleph: One who is uncircumcised and all those who are tame may not eat truma, but their wives and slaves may eat truma.  A petzua daka (one with crushed testicles) and a krut shafcha (one who was castrated) they and their slaves may eat, but their wives may not.  And if she didn’t know her (sleep with her) from when he became a petzua daka or a krut shafcha (they were already married and then he became one of these), then they may eat.
Bet: What is a petzua daka?  All whose testicles were crushed, even (if only) one of them (was crushed).  And a krut shafcha (what is it)?  All whose penis was severed.  And if even a hair is left of the crown (top of the penis), he is valid (to do temple service).  A petzua daka and a krut shafcha are allowed (to marry) a convert or a freedwoman, and aren’t assur except to come in the congregation (of Yisra’el) as it says, “a petzua daka and krut shafcha shall not come into the congregation of Hashem.”
Gimmel: An Amoni and Mo’avi (people of the nations of Ammon and Mo’av) are assur, and their issur is an eternal issur, but their females are mutar immediately.  A Mitzri (Egyptian) and an Edomi aren’t assur except for (up to) the third generation, whether males or females.  Rabi Shimon allows the females immediately.  Rabi Shimon says, it’s a kal vechomer in the matters, just as in a place where the males are assur forever the females are allowed immediately, in a place where the males were only assur until the third generation, shouldn’t it be that we allow females immediately?  They said to him, if it’s halacha, we’ll accept it, and if it’s an inference we have an answer (the pasuk gives a reason for Ammon and Moav which does not apply to women, so a kal vechomer is invalid).  He said to them, no, I am stating a halacha.  Mamzerim and netinin are assur, and their issur is an eternal issur whether male or female.
Daled: Rabi Yehoshua said, I heard that a eunuch does chalitza, and they do chalitza for his wife and that (where are cases where) a eunuch does not do chalitza and they do not do chalitza for his wife, and I can’t explain it.  Rabi Akiva said, I will explain it, a man eunuch (made a eunuch by man) does chalitza and they do chalitza for his wife, since he had a time of validity (before he was a eunuch).  A sun eunuch (a eunuch since birth) does not do chalitza and they do not do chalitza for his wife since he didn’t have a time of validity.  Rabi Eliezer says, not so, rather a sun eunuch does chalitza and they do chalitza for his wife, for he has a cure.  A man eunuch does not do chalitza and they do not do chalitza for his wife for he has no cure.  Rabi Yehoshua ben Bteira testified about ben Megusat who was a man eunuch in Yerushalayim and they did yibum for his wife, upholding the opinion of Rabi Akiva.
Hay: A (sun) eunuch does not do chalitza or yibum.  And so too a barren woman does not get chalitza or yibum.  A eunuch who did chalitza for his yevama does not make her pasul (to marry a kohen).  If he had sex with her, he made her pasul, for it is sex in the way of a whore.  And so too a barren woman who the brothers did chalitza for her, she isn’t pasul.  If they had sex with her, she is pasul, for this is sex in the way of a whore.
Vav: A kohen who was a sun eunuch who married a bat yisra’el, feeds her (she may eat) truma.  Rabi Yossi and Rabi Shimon say, an androgynous priest who married a bat yisra’el feeds her truma.  Rabi Yehuda says, a tumtum who was torn (skin, revealing the sexual organs he should have had) and was found to be a male does not do chalitza, for he is like a eunuch.  And androgynous marries (a woman), but is not married (by a man).  Rabi Eliezer says, (a man who has sex with) an androgynous is chayav stoning as if he were a man.
