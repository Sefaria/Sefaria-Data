Aleph: These are the people who are exiled, those who kill a person by accident.  He was pushing a roof-flattener and it fell on someone and killed him, he was lowering a barrel (by chain) and it fell and killed someone, and if he was going down on a ladder and he fell on someone and killed him, these are exiled.  But if he was pulling a roof-flattener and it fell on someone and killed him, he was raising a barrel and fell and killed someone, or he was going up a ladder and he full on someone and killed him, these aren’t exiled.  This is the general rule, anything that’s on its way down, is exiled, but what isn’t going down, isn’t exiled.  If the ax-head separated from the handle and killed someone, Rabi Meir said, he’s not exiled, Chachamim say he is.  (If the ax-head flew) from the tree being cut, Rabi Meir said he’s exiled, Chachamim say he’s not.
Bet: One who throws a stone into the public domain and kills someone he is exiled.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, if it was after the time that the stone left his hand that the victim poked out his head and got hit, he’s patur.  If he threw a stone into his yard and killed someone, if the victim has a right to enter there, he’s exiled, and if not, he’s not exiled, as it says, “when he shall come upon his friend in the forest.”  Just as the forest is a domain for the damager and the victim to enter, it excludes the yard of the owner, for the damager and victim don’t both have a right to be there.  Abba Shaul says, just as cutting trees is optional, it excludes a father who hits his son, a Rabbi reprimanding his student, and an emissary of Beit Din.
Gimmel: A father can be exiled at the hands of the son, and the son can be exiled at the hands of the father.  All are exiled at the hands of a Jew, and a Jew is exiled at the hands of everyone, except for at the hands of a resident alien.  A resident alien is only exiled at the hands of a resident alien.  A blind person isn’t exiled according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Meir says, he is exiled.  One who hates (the victim) isn’t exiled.  Rabi Yossi bar Yehuda says, one who hates is killed because he is as if forewarned.  Rabi Shimon says, there are those who hate who are exiled, and there are those who hate who aren’t.  This is the general rule, anytime on can say he killed willingly, he isn’t exiled, and when he didn’t kill willingly, this person is exiled.
Daled: To where are people exiled?  To an ir miklat, the three in Transjordan and the three in the land of Cana’an, as it says, “you shall put the three cities in Transjordan, and you shall put the three cities in the land of Cana’an, etc.”  Until the three in Israel we chosen, the three in Transjordan weren’t refuge, as it says, “six arei miklat shall there be,” until all six of them are refuge together.
Hay: And direct paths were made from one to the other, as it says, “prepare for yourself a path and divide into three etc.”  And they would give them (the exiled) two scholars lest the avenger kill them on the way, and they speak with them (the avenger).  Rabi Meir says, even he can speak on his own behalf, as it says, “and this is the word of the killer.”
Vav: Rabi Yossi said, it used to be that whether accidental or intentional, killers would go immediately to an ir miklat, and the court would send people to take them from there.  One who was guilty would be killed, the innocent would be set free, and the exiled would be returned as it says, “and the assembly would return him to his ir miklat etc.”  Whether a kohen gadol is anointed, is given increased garments (to start his ‘term’ when the anointment oil was no longer available), or passed from appointment (temporarily removed), they allow the killer to return.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one anointed for battle (a certain kohen but not the kohen gadol) can bring back the killer.  Therefore, mothers of kohanim provide (the accidental killers) with food and clothes, so that they won’t pray for their sons to die.  If once the sentence is passed a kohen gadol dies, he isn’t exiled.  If his case hasn’t finished and the kohen gadol dies, and then his case finishes, the new kohen gadol’s death allows him to return.
Zayin: When he got his sentence there was no kohen gadol, or he killed the kohen gadol, or the kohen gadol is a murderer, he never leaves the ir miklat.  He may not leave to give testimony about a mitzva, to give testimony about money, or to give testimony about capital cases.  Even if the Jews need him, even the general of the army of Yisra’el like Yo’av ben Tzruya, he never leaves there, as it says, “which he fled there,” there will be the place he lives, there will be the place he dies, and there will be the place he is buried.  Just as the city grants refuge, so too its outskirts grant refuge.  A murderer who was outside the limits and the avenger found him, Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, it’s a mitzva for the avenger and optional for everyone.  Rabi Akiva says, it’s optional for the avenger and everyone has no chiyuv for (killing) him.  A tree which is within the border and its branches bend beyond the border, or is outside the limits and its branches bend within the border, everything is decided (even) according to the branches.  One who killed in that city is exiled from one neighborhood to another, and a levi is exiled from city to city.
Chet: Similarly, a killer who was exiled to his ir miklat, and the people of the town want to honor him, he must say to them, I’m a killer.  If they say, even so, he may get from them, as it says, “and this is the word of the killer.”  They would pay rent to the levi’im according to Rabi Yehuda.  Rabi Meir says, they wouldn’t pay the levi’im rent.  He returns to any office he had held, according to Rabi Meir, and Rabi Yehuda says, he doesn’t return to any office he had/
