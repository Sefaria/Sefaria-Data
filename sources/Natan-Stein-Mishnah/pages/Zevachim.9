Aleph: The mizbe’ach sanctifies what is fit for it (anything fit for the mizbe’ach which touches it becomes holy).  Rabi Yehoshua says, whatever is fit for the fires (on the mizbe’ach) if it went up (on the mizbe’ach), it may not come down, as it says, “that is the olah (which says) on the flame on the mizbe’ach,” just as an olah is fit for the fires if it went up it may not come down, so too anything which is fit for the fires if it went up it may not come down.  Raban Gamliel says, whatever is fit for (offering on) the mizbe’ach, if it went up it may not come down, as it says, “that is the olah (which says) on the flame on the mizbe’ach,” just as the olah is fit for the mizbe’ach if it went up it may not come down, so too anything which is fit for the mizbe’ach if it went up it may not come down.  There is nothing (no difference) between the words of Raban Gamliel and the words of Rabi Yehoshua other than the blood and the libations, for Raban Gamliel says, they may not come down, and Rabi Yehoshua says, they may come down.  Rabi Shimon says, (even) if the zevach is kasher but the libations are pasul, the libations are kasher and the zevach is pasul, or if this and that (both) are pasul, the zevach may not come down, but the libations may come down.
Bet: And these, if they went up they may not come down, that which spent the night (without being offered, and is therefore unfit for offering), the (korban which became) tame, that which left (the courtyard), what was slaughtered (with an intention to eat) outside its time, (an intention for) outside its place, if unfit people accepted its blood, or of they sprinkled its blood.  Rabi Yehuda says, one that was slaughtered at night, its blood was spilled, or its blood went outside the curtains (of the Beit Hamikdash), if it went up, it may come down.  Rabi Shimon says it may not come down, for Rabi Shimon used to say, whatever became pasul in the kodesh (the courtyard) the kodesh accepts it, but if it didn’t become tame in the kodesh, the kodesh does not accept it.
Gimmel: These, their invalidation did not happen in the kodesh, an animal a woman has sex with, an animal which a man had sex with, one set aside (for avoda zara), that which was worshipped, one used to pay a prostitute, one with the value of a dog, one which is of mixed breed, a trefa (one which has internal blemishes), one born by Caesarian section, and those which are blemished.  Rabi Akiva validates ones which are blemished.  Rabi Chanina a sgan (assistant head) of the kohanim says, my father would push those with blemishes from atop the mizbe’ach.
Daled: Just as if these went up they may not come down, if they came down, they may not go (back) up.  But all of them that went up alive to the top of the mizbe’ach may come down.  An olah that went alive to the top of the mizbe’ach, it may come down.  If he slaughtered it on top of the mizbe’ach, he flays it and dissects it in its place (without bringing it down).
Hay: And these, if they went up, they may come down, the meat of the holy of holies, the meat of light holies, the leftover of the omer (any barley brought above the minimum is for the use of the kohanim), the two breads (brought on Shavuot), the showbreads, the leftovers of menachot (eaten by kohanim), incense, the wool that is on the head of sheep, the hair in the beard of goats, bones, sinew, horns, and hooves, when they are attached (to an animal), they may go up, as it says, “and the kohen shall burn everything (of an olah) on the mizbe’ach,” (but if) they were cut they may not go up, as it says, “and you shall do (offer) your blood the flesh and the blood.”
Vav: And all which sprang from atop the mizbe’ach should not be brought back.  And so too coals which sprang off from atop the mizbe’ach.  Organs which sprang from atop the mizbe’ach before midnight, he should return them (to finish burning), and there is me’ila by them, but after midnight, he should not return, and there is not me’ila by them.
Zayin: Just as the mizbe’ach makes that which is fit for it holy, so too the ramp makes holy.  Just as the mizbe’ach and the ramp make what is fit for them holy, all of the vessels make holy, the vessels for the moist make the moist holy, the measures of the dry make the dry holy.  But the vessels of the moist do not make the dry holy, and the measures of the dry do not make the moist holy.  The holy vessels which were pierced, if they do like the work they used to and are whole, they make holy, but if not, they do not make holy.  And all of them do not make holy other than in the kodesh (Beit Hamikdash).
