Aleph: One who says, behold I am a nazir shaves the thirty-first day, and if he shaved on the thirtieth, he’s yotze.  (If he said) behold I am a nazir for thirty days, if he shaved the thirtieth day, he’s not yotze.
Bet: One who made two nazir vows shaves for the first on the thirty-first day (to end his first nezirut) and the second on the sixty-first day.  And if he shaved the first on the thirtieth day, he shaves the second on the sixtieth.  And if he shaved on the fifty-ninth day, he’s yotze.  And this is the testimony that Rabi Papis testified, one who made two nazir vows, that if he shaves for the first on the thirtieth day, he shaves the second on the sixtieth day, and if on the fifty-ninth day, he’s yotze, for the thirtieth day is counted in the number (of the second nezirut).
Gimmel: One who said, behold I am a nazir, if he became tame on the thirtieth day, it blocks everything.  Rabi Eliezer says, it doesn’t block except seven.  Behold I am a nazir for thirty days, if he became tame on the thirtieth day, it blocks everything.
Daled: Behold I am a nazir for one hundred days, if he became tame on the hundredth day, it blocks everything.  Rabi Eliezer says, it does not block except thirty.  If he became tam on the hundred-first day, it blocks thirty days.  Rabi Eliezer says, it doesn’t block except seven.
Hay: One who became a nazir and he is in a graveyard, even if he was there thirty days, they do not go up for him (are included) in the count, and he does not bring a korban of tuma.  If he went out and came in, they go up for him in the count and he brings a korban of tuma.  Rabi Eliezer says, not (if he was in the graveyard) the first days, as it says, “and the first days will fall out (not be counted),” until he has first days (the count only begins when he has days where he observes his vow).
Vav: One who vowed in many neziriyot, and he completed his neziriyot, and afterwards came to the land (Israel, where his vow can actually be fulfilled) Beit Shamay says, he is a nazir for thirty days, and Beit Hillel says, he is a nazir from the beginning (fulfills all of his vows).  There was a case with Helene the queen that he son went off to war, and she said, if my son comes from war in peace, I will be a nezira for seven years.  He son came back from war, she was a nezira for seven years, and at the end of her nezirut, she made aliya to Israel, and Beit Hillel instructed her that she should be a nezira another seven years.  And at the end of the seven years she became tame, and if was found that she was a nezira for twenty-one years.  Rabi Yehuda said, she wasn’t a nezira except for fourteen years.
Zayin: One who had two groups of witnesses testifying about him, one testifying that he vowed two (thirty day periods) and one testifying that he vowed five, Beit Shamay says, the testimony is divided and there is no nezirut, and Beit Hillel says, two are included in five, he should be a nazir two.
