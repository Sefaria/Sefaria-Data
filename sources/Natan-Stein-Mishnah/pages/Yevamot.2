Aleph: How is (the case of) the wife of his brother who was not in his world?  Two brothers, one of them died, a brother was born to them, and afterwards the second did yibum for the wife of his brother, and he died (childless also).  The first is exempt because she is the wife of a brother who was not in his world, and the second because she is her rival.  If he (the second brother) made her a ma’amar (contracted marriage but did not consummate it), the second (wife) gets chalitza but not yibum.
Bet: Two brothers and one of them died, and the second did yibum for the wife of his brother, sand afterwards a son was born to them, and he (the second brother) died, the first is exempt because she is the wife of a brother who was not in his world, and the second because she is her rival.  If he (the second brother) made her a ma’amar, the second gets chalitza but not yibum.  Rabi Shimon says, he does yibum for whichever one he wants, or does chalitza for whichever one he wants.
Gimmel: they said a general rule in doing yibum, all who is assur because of inappropriate relations is not given chalitza or yibum.  If her issur is an issur of mitzva or an issur of kdusha (explained in the next mishna), she gets chalitza and not yibum.  Her sister who is her sister-in-law may have chalitza or yibum.
Daled: Issur mitzva, secondary (inappropriate relations, such as his grandmother or granddaughter-in-law) from the words of the scribes (early sages).  Issur of kedusha (sanctification), a widow to the kohen gadol, and a divorcee or chalutza (one who got chalitza) to a lay kohen, a mamzer (bastard) or netina (a nation which deceived Yehoshua) to a yisra’el, and a daughter of a yisra’el to a natin or a mamzer.
Hay: One who has any sort of brother (including a mamzer) requires the wife of his brother to have yibum, and is (considered the same as) his brother in every matter, excluding one who has (a brother who is) from a (Cana’ani) maidservant or from a non-Jew (making the brother not Jewish).  One who has a son from any source he (the son) exempts the wife of his father from yibum, and he (the son) is chayav on hitting him (the father) and cursing him, and is his son in every matter, except for one he has from a maidservant or from a non-Jew.
Vav: One who married one of two sisters and doesn’t know which one he married, he gives a get (divorce paper) to each.  If he died, and he has one brother, he does chalitza for both.  If he had two (brothers) one does chalitza and one does yibum.  If they went ahead (before consulting the court) and got married, they do not take them from their hands (they do not divorce).
Zayin: Two who married two sisters, and neither knows which one he married, each one gives two gittin.  If they died and each has a brother, each does chalitza for both.  One has one (brother) and one has two, the single does chalitza for both, and the two, one does chalitza and one does yibum.  If they went ahead and got married, they so not take them from their hands.  If they each have two (brothers), one brother of each does chalitza for one, and the other brother of each does yibum for the chalutza of this one (his brother).  If two went ahead and did chalitza, the two of them will not do yibum, rather one does chalitza and one does yibum.  If they went ahead and got married, they do not take them from their hands.
Chet: The mitzva is on the eldest to do yibum, and if the younger did it first, he merited.  One accused of (being the son of) a maidservant and she was released, or about a non-Jew and she converted, behold this one may not marry, and if he married, the do not take from his hands.  One who is accused of (sleeping with) the wife of a man, they take her out from his hand, and even though he married, they remove.
Tet: One who brings a get from overseas and says, it was written in my presence and it was signed in my presence, he (the messenger) may not marry his wife (the one the get was written for).  (If the messenger testifies about the husband that) he died, I killed him, or we killed him, he may not marry his wife.  Rabi Yehuda says, (if he says) I killed him, his wife may not get married, we killed him, his wife may get married.
Yud: A sage who prohibited a woman to her husband based on a vow (which she made to derive no pleasure from him, that the husband did not deny, and the sage found no loophole in, so she divorced him), this one (the sage) may not marry her (we are afraid he will intentionally make them divorce so he can marry her).  One who refused or had chalitza in his presence he may marry her, since he is a court.  And all who (in the above cases were prohibited) had wives and they died, may marry them (the previously prohibited women, since they already had wives at the time of the ruling).  And all (of the prohibited women) who married others and got divorced or became widow, they are allowed to marry them (the previously prohibited men).  And all of them (the women) are mutar to the sons and the brothers (of the prohibited men).
