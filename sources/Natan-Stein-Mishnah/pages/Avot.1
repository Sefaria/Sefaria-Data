Aleph: Moshe got the torah from Sinai, and passed it to Yehoshua, and Yehoshua passed to the elders, and the elders to the prophets, and the prophets to the men of the great assembly.  They said three things, be deliberate in judgment, raise up many students, and make fences for the torah.
Bet: Shimon Hatzadik was one of the remnants of the great assembly, and he used to say, the world stands on three things, on torah, on temple service, and on acts of kindness.
Gimmel: Antigonus of Socho received (the torah) from Shimon Hatzadik.  He used to say, do not be like slaves who serve the master in order to get a reward, rather be like slaves who serve the master not to get a reward, and be let fear of Heaven be upon you.
Daled: Yossi ben Yoezer of Tzrar and Yossi ben Yochanan of Yerushalayim received (torah) from them (Shimon and Antigonus).  Yossi ben Yoezer used to say, let your house be a meeting house for wise men, be stuck to the dust of their feet (follow them), and drink down their words with thirst.
Hay: Yossi ben Yochanan of Yerushalayim used to say, let you house be wide open, let the poor be household members, and don’t talk too much (idly) with women.  If by his wife they said this, it obviously talks about his friend’s wife.  From here the Chachamim say, whenever a man talks too much with a woman, he causes himself harm, he voids torah, and in the end he will inherit hell.
Vav: Yehoshua ben Prachia and Nitai Ha’arbeli received (torah) from them.  Yehoshua ben Prachia says, make for yourself a Rabbi, acquire for yourself a friend, and judge everyone favorably.
Zayin: Nitai Ha’arbeli says, distance yourself from a bad neighbor, do not attach yourself to a wicked man, and do not lose faith in ‘karma’.
Chet: Yehuda ben Tabay and Shimon ben Shetach got torah from them.  Yehuda ben Tamay says, do not make yourself like a lawyer, when the parties stand before you treat them as sinners (look carefully into their words), and when they depart from you look upon them as innocent for they accepted the judgment upon themselves.
Tet: Shimon ben Shetach says, examine the witnesses a lot and be careful with your words, for from them, they might learn how to lie (find a loophole).  
Yud: Shmaya and Avtalyon got from them.  Shmaya says, love work, hate being a master, and don’t become familiar with the ruling powers (in seek of power).
Yud Aleph: Avtalyon says, Chachamim, be careful of your words, lest you become liable of the punishment of exile, and you will be exiled to the place of bad water, and the students after you will drink and will die, and the name of Heaven will be cursed.
Yud Bet: Hillel and Shamay got from them.  Hillel says, be a student of Aaron, love peace and chase peace and love the creations and draw them close to torah.
Yud Gimmel: He (Hillel) used to say, one who seeks fame will lost his reputation, one who doesn’t add detracts, one who doesn’t learn deserves death, and one who uses the crown (of torah for worldly benefits) will perish.
Yud Daled: He (Hillel) used to say, if I am not for myself, who is for me?, and when I am for myself (only) who am I?, and if not now, when?
Tet Vav: Shamay says, make your torah a fixed habit, say little and do much, and receive everyone with a cheerful face.
Tet Zayin: Raban Gamliel says, set for yourself a Rav, remove yourself from doubt, and don’t often take ma’asrot by guesswork.
Yud Zayin: Shimon his son says, all my days I grew up among the sages, and I didn’t find anything better for a person than silence, the expounding (of rules) isn’t the most important, but rather the action, and anyone who speaks excessively brings in sin.
Yud Chet: Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, on three things does the world stand, on judgment, on truth, and on peace, as it says, “truth, judgment, and peace shall you judge in your gates.”
