Aleph: One who had kuryakos (a mental disorder) and said, write a get for my wife, he didn’t say anything.  If he said, write a get for my wife, he had kuryakos, and he returned (to his sanity) and said, do not write (the get), his last words are nothing (for he was of sound mind when he first asked for the get).  If he became mute, and they said to him, should we write a get for your wife?  He nodded his head, they check him three times, if he said about (something which has the proper response of) no, no, and on yes, yes, behold they write and give.
Bet: If they said to him (a man), shall we write a get for your wife, and he said, write.  They told the scribe and he wrote, and (they told) the witnesses and they signed.  Even though they wrote it, signed it, and gave it to her, or he (the husband) went back (to the people he told to write the get) and gave it to her, behold the get is void, until he (directly) says to the scribe, write, and to the witnesses, sign.
Gimmel: (One who says to his wife,) this is your get if I die, this is your get if I die from this illness (I have now), this is your get after death , he didn’t say anything (because he cannot give a get posthumously).  (If he said) from today if I die, or from now if I die, behold it is a get (because it becomes effective retroactively).  From today and after death, it is a get and not a get (we are not sure if it a get), if he dies, she does chalitza and not yibum (because the brother would not need to marry her if they were divorced).  This is your get from today if I die from this illness, and he got up, walked in the shuk, got sick, and died, they evaluate him, if he died from the first illness, it is a get, and if no, it is not a get.
Daled: She may not be alone with him except before witnesses (after she receives her get), even a slave or even a maidservant, except for her maidservant, for her heart is course with her maidservant (she is familiar with her maidservant and she doesn’t mind what she sees).  What is she in those days (when she has the get on condition but her husband has not died)?  Rabi Yehuda says, like a man’s wife (married) for everything.  Rabi Yossi says, divorced and not divorced (we are not sure).
Hay: (If a man said to his wife,) behold this is your get on the condition that you give me two-hundred zuz, behold she is divorced (from when she receives the get) and she has to give (the money to fulfill the condition).  (If he says,) on the condition that you give me (two hundred zuz) from now until thirty days, if she gave him within thirty days, she is divorced, and if not, she is not divorced.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, there was a case in Tzidan with one who said to his wife, behold this is your get on condition that you give me my cloak, and his cloak got lost, the Chachamim said, she gives him its value.
Vav: (If a man said to his wife,) behold this is your get on condition you serve my father or on condition that you nurse my son (and he doesn’t specify a time), (for) how much  (time) does she nurse him?  Two years.  Rabi Yehuda says, eighteen months,.  If the son died or the father died, behold, it is a get.  (If he said,) behold this is your get on condition that you serve my father for two years or on condition that you nurse my son for two years, if the son died, the father died, or the father said, I don’t want you to serve me, without anger (she did not anger him) it is not a get.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, like this it is a get.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said a general rule, any hindrance which is not from her, behold it is a get.
Zayin: (If a man said to his wife,) behold this is your get if I don’t come (back) from here until thirty days, and he was going from Yehuda to the Galil (and he made another condition that if he reached the Galil the get would take effect).  If he reached Antipatras (a city on the border of the Galil, but still in Yehuda) and returned (within the thirty days), his condition is null (and the get is invalid).  (If he said,) behold this is your get if I don’t come (back) from here until thirty days, and he was going from Yehuda to the Galil (with the same added condition as before).  He made it to Kfar Otnaya (on the border, but actually in the Galil), his condition is null.  Behold this is your get if I don’t come from here until thirty days, and he was going overseas.  He reached Akko and returned, his condition is null.  Behold this is your get if I pass away from your face (not see you) thirty days.  If he was going and coming, going and coming, since he was not with her, behold it is a get.
Chet: Behold this is your get if I do not come from here until thirty days, and he died with twelve months, it is not a get.  Behold this is your get from now if I don’t come from here until twelve months, and he died within twelve months, behold this is a get.
Tet: (If he said to two people,) if I do not come from here until twelve months write a get and give it to my wife, if they wrote the get within twelve months and gave after twelve months, it is not a get.  Write a get and give it to my wife if I don’t come from here until twelve months, if they wrote within twelve months and gave after twelve months, it is not a get.  Rabi Yossi says, like this it is a get.  If they wrote after twelvemonths, gave after twelve months, and he died, if the get came before the death, behold it is a get.  If the death came before the get, it isn’t a get.  And if it’s not known (which came first) this is what is said, she is divorced and not divorced.
