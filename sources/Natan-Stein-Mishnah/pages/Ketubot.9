Aleph: One who writes for his wife (as a condition for marriage), I have no claim or rights in your property, behold he eats the fruits in her lifetime (for we assume he did not intend to void this right) and if she dies he inherits her (for he only renounced rights during her life).  If so, why did he write for her, I have no claim or rights in your property?  So that if she sold it or gave it away it stands.  If he wrote for her, I have no claim or right to your property and your fruits, behold he does not eat fruits during her lifetime, and if she dies, he inherits her.  Rabi Yehuda says, he always eats the benefits of her fruits, unless he writes, I have no claim or rights in your property, your fruits, or the benefits of your fruits forever.  If he wrote her, I have no claim or rights in your property, your fruits, or the benefits of your fruits in your life and in your death, he does not eat the fruits in her life, and if she dies, he does not inherit her.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, if she died, I will inherit he, for he made a condition (against) what was written in the torah (for the torah writes that a husband inherits from a wife) and all who make a condition on the torah, his condition is invalid.
Bet: One who died, and left a wife, a creditor, and inheritors, and he had a deposit or loan in the hands of another, Rabi Tarfon says, it (the money) will be given to the weakest (poorest) of them.  Rabi Akiva said, we do not have compassion in judgment.  Rather, it is given to his inheritors, for all of them need a swear and the inheritors do not need a swear.
Gimmel: If he left fruit detached from the ground, whoever comes first merits it.  If a woman merited more than her ktuba or a creditor more than he was over, the leftover, Rabi Tarfon says, it will be given to the weakest (poorest) of them.  Rabi Akiva said, we do not have compassion in judgment.  Rather, it is given to his inheritors, for all of them need a swear and the inheritors do not need a swear.
Daled: One who sets his wife as a storeowner, or he appointed her a trustee (of his estate), behold this one can make her swear (that she is conducting business properly) whenever he wants.  Rabi Eliezer says, even on her spindle and on her dough (he may force her to swear honesty in spinning and cooking).
Hay: If he wrote for her, I have no vow or oath upon you (he may not impose either upon her) he cannot impose an oath, but he may impose an oath on her heirs (make them swear about financial matter dealing with her ktuba) and those who come with her permission (if she sold her ktuba).  I have no vow or oath upon you, your inheritors, or people who come with your permission, he may not impose an oat on her, on her heirs, or on people coming with her permission.  But his heirs may impose an oath on her, her heirs, and people coming with her permission.  I, my heirs, and people coming with my permission) have no vow or oath upon you, your inheritors, or people who come with your permission, he, his heirs, and those coming with his permission may not impose an oath on her, on her heirs, or on people coming with her permission.
Vav: If she went from her husband’s grave to her father’s house, or she returned to the house of her father in law and she was not made a trustee, the heirs may not impose an oath upon her.  And if she was made a trustee, the heirs may impose a swear on her for the future, but they do not impose a swear upon her about the past.
Zayin: One who impairs her ktuba (she admits that part was already paid) may not collect except by an oath.  If one witness testifies that she was paid, she only collects by an oath.  (If her claim will be paid) from the property of orphans, or from mortgaged property, and if he is not before her, she may only collect by oath.
Chet: What is a woman who impairs her ktuba?  Her ktuba was a thousand zuz, and he said to her, you got your ktuba, ad she says, I only got a maneh, she does not collect except by oath.  How does one witness testify that she collected?  Her ktuba was a thousand zuz and he said, you got it, she said, I didn’t get it, and then one witness testifies that she collected, she does not collect except by oath.  How from mortgaged property?  He sold his property to others, and she collects from the buyers she does not collect except by oath.  How from the property of orphans?  He died and left his things to orphans, and she collects from the orphans, she does not collect except by oath.  And how not before him?  He went overseas and she collects not before him, she does not collect except by oath.  Rabi Shimon says, whenever she claims her ktuba, the heirs make her swear, and if she does not claim her ktuba, the heirs may not make her swear (about her business dealings in life).
Tet: If she brings out a get but not a ktuba, she collects her ktuba (for the normal amount paid).  (If she brings) a ktuba but not a get and she says, I lost my get, and he (the husband) says, I lost my receipt (that I paid the ktuba), and so too a creditor who took out a bill of a loan but no a prozbul, behold these do not collect.  Raban Shimon Ben Gamliel says, from the time of danger (when people were afraid to keep religious documents because of persecution) and on, a woman collects her ktuba without a get and a creditor collects without a prozbul.  If she has two gittin and two ktubot, she collects two ktubot.  (If she has) two ktubot and one get, a ktuba and two gittin, or a ktuba, a get, and (witness of) his death, she only collects one ktuba, for one who divorces his wife and takes her back based on the first ktuba he takes her back.  A minor whose father married him (off) her (his wife’s) ktuba is valid for it was made for this (it took into account that he was a minor at the time, but would extend to when he was an adult).  A convert who converted with his wife, her ktuba is valid for based on this he kept her.
