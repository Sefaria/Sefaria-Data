Aleph: And these are the people who are burnt: one who has sex with a woman and her daughter (one of whom is his wife) and a kohen’s daughter who committed adultery.  The category of a woman and her daughter includes his daughter, his granddaughter, his wife’s daughter his step-granddaughter, his mother-in-law, his mother-in-law’s mother, and the mother of his father-in-law.  And these are the people who are killed: the murderer and the people of a wayward city.  A murderer who killed with a stone or with iron or forced him into water or fire such that he couldn’t get out, and he dies, is chayav.  One who pushes his friend into water or fire, and he can get out, is patur.  He sicced upon him a dog or a snake, he’s patur.  He caused a snake to bite the person, Rabi Yehuda says he’s chayav, and Chachamim say patur.  If a person struck his friend whether with a rock or his fist, and they evaluated that he would die, he got better, but then got worse and died, he’s chayav.  Rabi Nechemia says patur, for there is basis for him to be patur.
Bet: One who intended to kill an animal but killed a human, to kill a non-Jew but killed a Jew, to kill a premature baby (who would routinely die in those days) but killed a normal baby is patur.  He intended to hit him on the loins, and there wasn’t sufficient force to kill on his loins, but he hit the heart, where there was sufficient force to kill, he is patur.  If he intended to hit the heart with sufficient force to kill, but he hit the loins with insufficient force but the person died anyway, he is patur.  He meant to hit an adult with insufficient force to kill, but he hit a minor with a sufficient force to kill, he is patur.  He intended to hit a minor with sufficient force to kill, but he hit an adult with insufficient force to kill but he died anyways, he is patur.  But, if he intended to hit on the loins and there was sufficient force to kill on the loins and it went on the heart, he is chayav.  He intended to hit an adult and there was sufficient force to kill an adult but he hit a minor who died, he’s chayav.  Rabi Shimon says, even if he intended to kill this one and he killed that he is patur.
Gimmel: A murderer who got confused among other people, we find all of them patur.  Rabi Yehuda says, we assemble them in the dome (prison).  All who are to be killed but get mixed up with others are judged by the most lenient death.  Those who should get stoning mixed in with those to be burned, Rabi Shimon says they are stoned, since burning is worse, and Chachamim say that they are burned, for stoning is worse.  Rabi Shimon said to them, if burning weren’t worse, it wouldn’t be given to the daughter of a kohen who committed adultery.  They said to him, if stoning weren’t worse, it wouldn’t be given to a blasphemer or idolater.  Ones who might be killed by strangulation, Rabi Shimon says by sword, and Chachamim say by strangulation.
Daled: One who is chayav two deaths by the court is given the stricter one.  If he did one act which can have two deaths, he is given the stricter.  Rabi Yossi says, he gets the first punishment for which the trial was first completed.
Hay: One who was lashed and repeated the offence, the court sends him to jail and feeds him barley until his stomach bursts.  One who kills without witnesses, they bring him to prison and feed him slight portions of bread and scant water.
Vav: One who steals a vessel used for libation, curses by magic, or has sex with an Aramean woman, zealots kill him (on the spot).  A kohen who did temple service while tame, his brother kohanim don’t bring him to court, rather the young kohanim take him outside of the courtyard and smash his head with a plank.  A non-kohen who served in the Temple, Rabi Akiva says, he dies by strangulation, and Chachamim say, at the hands of Hashem.
