Aleph: With what may an animal go out with (put on by the owners, going into the public domain) and with what may an animal not go out?  A camel may go out with a bit, a female camel with a ring (placed in the nose to allow for extra control), an especially difficult donkey with a halter, a horse with a chain, and all animals which go out with a chain may go out with a chain and be pulled by a chain, and (while still on the animal) one may sprinkle them (the chain, to make them tahor if they became tame) and immerse them while they are in their place (one the animal’s neck).
Bet: A donkey may go out with a cushion for warming it, while it is tied to it (the donkey).  Rams may go out covered (so they do not mount the females), ewes may go out exposed (tail tied up), tied (tails tied down), or covered (to keep their wool clean).  Goats may go out bound (bags on their teats to control milk flow).  Rabi Yossi forbids all of them, except for ewes covered.  Rabi Yehuda says, goats may go out tied.  Rabi Yehuda says, goats may go out tied to dry them (tightly to prevent milk) but not to make them have milk (loosely to protect the milk).
Gimmel: And with what do they not go out?  A camel may not go out with a pad on its hump, a front leg tied to a back leg, or its leg tied to its thigh (to immobilize that leg), and so too with all animals.  One may not tie camels to each other and pull, but he may gather the ropes in his hand and pull, as long as he doesn’t wrap (the ropes around his hand).
Daled: A donkey may not go out with a cushion if it’s not tied to it, not with a bell, even if it is muffled, not with a ladder around its neck (a type of yoke which prevents it from turning its head), and not with a strap on its leg (to protect from rubbing).  Roosters may not go out with strings or straps on their legs, rams may not go out with wagons under their fat-tails, ewes may not go out with nose chips (a device which makes them sneeze and has worms fall from their heads), a calf may not go out with a small yoke, and a cow may not go out with a hedgehog skin (the spikes would protect the teats from being drunk from as the cow sleeps) or a strap between its horns.  The cow of Rabi Elazar ben Azariah would go out with a strap between its horns, which was not according to the will of Chachamim.
