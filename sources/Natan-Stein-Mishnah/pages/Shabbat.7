Aleph: They said a great general rule about Shabbat, whoever forgets the principle of Shabbat and does many melachot (work prohibited on Shabbat) on many Shabbatot, he is only chayav one chatat.  One who knows about the principle of Shabbat (but forgot about it) and he did many melachot on many Shabbatot, he is chayav for each Shabbat.  One who knows it is Shabbat and does many melachot, he is chayav on each category of melacha.  One who does many melachot which are all similar to one melacha (the av melacha) he is only chayav one chatat.
Bet: There are forty minus one categories of melacha, one who sows, plows, harvests, bundles, threshes, winnows, sorts (out the bad grains), grinds, sifts, kneads, bakes, shears wool, bleaches, cards, dyes, spins, sets the warp (thread) on the loom, makes two loops, weaves two strings, ‘unweaves’ two strings, ties, unties, sews two stitches, tears in order to sew two stitches, traps a dear, shechts it, skins it, salts it, works its leather, smoothes it, cuts it (to size), writes two letters, erases in order to write two letters, builds, dismantles, puts out a fire, lights a fire, strikes with a hammer (completing a process), and takes from domain to domain, behold, these are the forty minus one categories of melacha.
Gimmel: And they said another general principle, anything which is fit to be set aside (is of sufficient use to be taken care of) and people set aside things like it (of that size such that it is useful) and one carried it on Shabbat, he is chayav a chatat.  And whatever isn’t fit to be set aside and people don’t set aside things like it, he isn’t chayav, only if the person himself (would) set it aside.
Daled: One who carries straw (must carry), enough to fill a cow’s mouth; pea stalks, enough to fill a camel’s mouth; sheaves, enough to fill a lamb’s mouth; herbs, enough to fill a kid’s mouth; moist garlic leaves (greens) and moist onion leaves, the size of a dried fig; and dry, enough to fill a kid’s mouth.  They do not combine with one another, since they don’t have equal measures.  One who carries food the size of a dried fig is chayav, and they combine, since they have the same measure, except their skins, pits, stems, and coarse and fine bran.  Rabi Yehuda says, except for the skin of lentils, for they are cooked with them.
