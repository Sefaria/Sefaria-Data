Aleph: Rabi Akiva said, from where do we learn that carrying (but not necessarily touching) avoda zara becomes tame, just as a menstruating woman (nidda).  As it says, “put them as far away as an unclean woman, ‘get out’ shall you tell it.”  Just as a nidda makes tame by carrying so too avoda zara makes unclean by carrying.
Bet: From where (do we know that) a boat is (always) tahor?  As it says, “the path of a ship in the heart of the sea” (equating the ship to the sea).  From where (do we know that) a bed which is six by six tfachim one may sow five types of seed, four on the four sides and one in the middle?  As it says, “for like the land produces its vegetation and like a garden her seeds she will sprout.”  It doesn’t say, her seed, but rather her seeds.
Gimmel: From where (do we know that) a woman who emits semen on the third day (after having relations) is tame?  As it says, “be ready for three days.”  From where (do we know that) one may wash a baby who had a brit mila on the third day if it falls out on Shabbat?  As it says, “and it was on the third day when they were in pain.”  From where (do we know that) that they tie a tongue of red wool on the head of the scapegoat?  As it says, “if your sins will be like red wool, like snow they will be whitened.”
Daled: From where (do we know that) anointing is like drinking on Yom Hakippurim?  Even though there is no proof for the thing, there is a mention of it, as it says, “and come like water to his insides and like oil on his bones.
Hay: One who carries wood, enough to cook alight egg; spices, enough to season a light egg, and they combine; nut shells, pomegranate peels, woad (an herb producing blue dye), and madder (an herb producing red dye), enough to dye with them a small garment in a headdress; urine, natron, and lixivium, Cimolian earth (a type of chalk), and potassium, enough to wash a small garment in a headdress.  Rabi Yehuda says, enough to pass over a stain (to check if it is blood or dye).
Vav: Pepper, any amount; sap from a tree, any amount; various spices and various metals, any amount; from the stones of an altar, the dirt of an altar, worm-eaten books and worm-eaten bands, at all, for people may put them aside to bury them.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one who carries the tools of avoda zara, any amount, as it says, “and it should not stay in your hand anything from the excommunicated.”
Zayin: One who carries a peddler’s basket, even though it has may types, he is only chayav one chatat.  Garden seeds, less than a dried fig.  Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira says, five (seeds).  Squash seeds, two; gourd seeds, two; and Egyptian beans, two.  A live, tahor locust, any amount, and dead, like a dried fig.  The bird of vineyards, whether alive or dead, any amount, for one sets it aside for medicine.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one who carries a live, tame locust any amount, for one sets it aside for children to play with.
