Aleph: All zvachim of which the blood was collected (for sprinkling) by a zar (non-kohen), one who is grieving, tvul yom (one who was tame, immersed, and has to wait until sundown to be tahor), one missing clothes, one missing atonement (for some sin), whose hands and feet were not washed, is uncircumcised, is tame, is sitting, is standing on a vessel, on an animal, or on the feet of his friend (for contact with the floor of the Beit hamikdash is needed for holiness), he invalidated it.  If he collected (the blood) with his left (hand), he invalidated it.  Rabi Shimon validates.  If it spilled on the floor and he collected it, he invalidated it.  If he put it on the ramp, not facing the base (an improper part of the mizbe’ach to sprinkle on), if he put what is to be put (sprinkled) on the bottom (half of the mizbe’ach) on the top, what is to be put on the top on the bottom, what is to be put inside (on the inner mizbe’ach) one the outer (mizbe’ach), or what is to be put on the outer on the inner, it is invalid, but there is no karet (for eating the korban).
Bet: One who slaughters a zevach (intending) to sprinkle its plod outside (of the Beit Hamikdash, which is invalid), (to sprinkle) part of its blood outside, to burn its portions (which are supposed to be burnt) outside (which is invalid), (to burn) its portions outside, to eat its meat outside (of Yerushalayim), (to eat) a kzayit of its meat outside, or to eat a kzayit of the tail (which is edible) outside, it is pasul, but there is not karet (for one who eats it).  (if he intends) to sprinkle its blood tomorrow, part of its blood tomorrow, to burn its portions tomorrow, part of its portions tomorrow, to eat its meat tomorrow, a kzayit of its meat tomorrow, or a kzayit of the skin of the tail tomorrow, it is  (called) pigul, and (one who eats it) is chayav karet for it.
Gimmel: This is the general rule, whoever slaughters, accepts, walks (the blood to the place of sprinkling), and sprinkles (with an intention) to eat the thing the way of which is to be eaten or to burn something the way of which is to be burnt, but outside its place, it is pasul but there is no karet, if outside its time, it is pigul and one is chayav upon it karet, as long has he offers (something) permitted in its way (there is not other problem with the korban).
Daled: How does he offer the permitted in its way (such that it can become pigul)?  He slaughtered in silence (with no improper intention), accepted, walked, and sprinkled (with an intention to do things) outside their time; he slaughtered (with intention) outside its time, accepted, walked, and sprinkled in silence; or he slaughtered accepted, walked and sprinkled outside its time, this is how he offered permitted in its time.  How does he not offer the permitted in its way?  If he slaughtered (with an intention for) outside its place, accepted, walked, and sprinkled outside its time; he slaughtered outside its time, accepted, walked, and sprinkled outside its place; he slaughtered, accepted, walked, and sprinkled outside its place; a pesach or chatat which he slaughtered not for their sake, accepted, walked, and sprinkled outside its time; (a pesach or chatat) he slaughtered outside its time, accepted, walked, and sprinkled not for their sake; or he slaughtered, accepted, walked, and sprinkled not for their sake, this is not offered the permitted in its way.
Hay: (If he intends) to eat a kzayit outside and (then intends to eat) a kzayit tomorrow, a kzayit tomorrow and then a kzayit outside, like half an olive outside and like half an olive tomorrow, or like half an olive tomorrow and like half an olive outside, it is pasul, but there is no karet in it (it is not pigul).  Rabi Yehuda said, this is the general rule, if the thought of the time came before the thought of the place, it is pigul and one is chayav karet on it, but if the thought of the place came before the thought of the time, it is pasul but there is not karet in it.  Chachamim say, this and that (either way it) is pasul and there is not karet.  (If he intended) to eat like half an olive (at the wrong time or place) and to burn like half an olive (at the wrong time or place) it is kosher, for eating and burning do not combine.
