Aleph: One who intentionally ate truma pays the principal but not the chomesh.  The repayment is in chulin.  If the kohen wants to forgo, he may.
Bet: The daughter of a kohen who married a yisra’el and then ate truma, she pays the principal but not the chomesh, and her death is by burning (if she committed adultery).  If she married someone who is invalid (i.e. challa or mamzer) she pays principal and chomesh, and she will die by strangulation, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, both of these pay the principal but not chomesh, and die by burning.
Gimmel: One who serves is little children and his slaves whether adults or minors, eats truma from outside of Israel, or eats less than a kzayit of truma, pays the principal but not the chomesh and the restitution is in chulin.  If the kohen wants to forgo, he may forgo.
Daled: This is the general rule, anyone who pays principal and chomesh, the restitution is in truma.  If the kohen wants to forgo, he may not forgo.  And all who pay principal but not chomesh, the restitution is in chulin, and if the kohen wants to forgo, he may forgo.
Hay: There were two baskets, one of truma and one of chulin, and a se’ah of truma fell into one of them, and it isn’t known into which of them, I can say, it fell into the truma.  If it’s not known which is truma and which is chulin, and he ate one of them, he’s patur.  The second, he treats it as truma and it’s chayav challa, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi allows it.  If another person ate the second, he’s patur.  If one ate both of them, he pays according to the smaller of the baskets.
Vav: If one of them (the baskets) fell into chulin, it doesn’t make meduma.  If the second does too, he treats it as truma and it’s chayav challa, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi allows it.  If the second falls into a different place, it doesn’t make meduma.  If they both fell into one place, it makes meduma according to the smaller of them.
Zayin: If he sowed one of them, he’s patur, if he did the second also, he treats it as truma (he must plow it under or the produce will grow as truma) and it is chayav in challa, according to Rabi Meir.  And Rabi Yossi allows it.  If another person sowed the other, he’s patur.  If one person sowed them both, if it’s a type where the seed perishes (in the ground), it’s mutar, but a species where they don’t perish, it’s assur.
