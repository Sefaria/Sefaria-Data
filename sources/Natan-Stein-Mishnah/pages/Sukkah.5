Aleph: The flute five and six, this is the flute of the Beit Hasho’eva (place of drawing, festivities held for the water libation) for it doesn’t push off either Shabbat or Yom Tov.  They said, all who hasn’t seen the festivities of Beit Hasho’eva has not seen festivities in all his days.
Bet: On motzei Yom Tov of the first (day) of the festival they went down to the women’s courtyard, and they would fix there a great fix (make a balcony for the women so as to keep a separation).  And there were golden lamps there and four golden bowls on their head, and four ladders for each one, and four children from the young kohanim and in their hands jars of one hundred twenty log of oil, which they would pour into each bowl.
Gimmel: From the worn out pants of kohanim and from their belts they would make wicks, and they would light with them.  And there wasn’t a courtyard in Yerushalayim which wasn’t lit up from the light of the Beit Hasho’eva.
Daled: The pious and men of (good) deeds would dance before them (the crowd) with torches of fire in their hands, and would say before them songs and praises.  And the levi’im with harps, lyres, cymbals, trumpets, and musical instruments which can’t be counted (they are so numerous).  By fifteen stairs they would go down from the yisra’el courtyard to the women’s courtyard, corresponding to the number of “shir hama’alot” (an introduction to certain psalms) in Tehilim, which on them the levi’im would stand with instruments and saying songs.  And two kohanim stood by the upper gate which goes down from the yisra’el courtyard to the women’s courtyard, and they held two trumpets.  The man (referring to a rooster) called (crowed) and they blew a tkiya, trua, tkiya.  When they reached the tenth step they blew a tkiya, trua, tkiya.  When they reached the courtyard, they blew a tkiya, trua, tkiya.  They would blow and walk, until they got to the gate which exited east.  When they got to the gate which exited east, they would turn themselves facing west and say, our forefathers who were in the place (turned their) backs to the sanctuary of Hashem and they faced the sun, and they would bow east to the sun, and we, to Hashem are our eyes.  Rabi Yehuda says, they would repeat and say, we are to Hashem and to Hashem are our eyes.
Hay: They do not do less than twenty-one tkiyot in the Beit Hamikdash, and they do not do more than forty-eight.  Every day there were twenty-one tkiyot, three for opening the gates, nine for the tamid of the morning, and nine for the tamid of the afternoon.  With a musaf they would add another nine, and on erev Shabbat they would add another six, three to stop the nation from its work and thee do differentiate between kodesh and chol.  Erev Shabbat which was during Sukkot there were forty-eight there, three for opening the gates, three for the upper gate (between the courtyards), three for the lower gate, three for filling the water, three on the mizbe’ach, nine for the morning tamid, nine for the afternoon tamid, nine for the musaf, three to stop then nation from its work, and three to differentiate between kodesh and chol.
Vav: On the first day of Yom Tov of Sukkot there were thirteen bulls, two rams, and one goat.  There were fourteen lambs for the eight watches (croups of kohanim).  On the first day, six offer two, two (two each) and the rest (offer) one, one (one each).  One the second (day, with one less bull there was one more unoccupied watch), five offer two each and the rest one each.  On the third, four offer two each and the rest one each.  One the fourth, three offer two each and the rest one each.  One the fifth, two offer two each and the rest once each.  One the sixth, one offers two and the rest one each.  One the seventh, they are all equal.  One the eighth, they returned to the lots like on the festivals (for who got to lift ashes from the mizbe’ach).  They said, those who offered bulls today will not offer tomorrow, rather they return to the rotation.
Zayin: At three times in the year (the three festivals) all the watches were equal in the stated festival (offerings) and in the division of the showbread.  On Shavuot they would say to him, for you matza and for you chametz (each got a piece of both).  The watch which its time is set (to be when there was a festival) offers the temidin, oath offerings, and all other public offerings, and offers everything (not special for the festival).  Yom Tov which was next to Shabbat, whether before it or after, all the watches would be even in division of the showbread.
Chet: It fell out to have one intervening day between (the festival and Shabbat), the watch which it was its set time took ten breads, and the remaining would take two loaves.  And in the other days of the year, the entering (watch) would take six and the leaving would take six.  Rabi Yehuda says, the entering takes seven and the leaving would take five.  The entering would divide (their portion) in the north, and the leaving in the south.  Bilga (a watch which was penalized either because a daughter from that watch had disrespected the Beit Hamikdash, or because they came late, which was disrespectful) would always divide in the south, its ring (to hold the animal while slaughtering) was fixed (and unusable) and its window (to the place where the knives were kept) was closed.
