Aleph: A chatat cow which one burned outside of its pit (for burning) and so too the sent-off goat (on Yom Hakippurim) which one offered outside, he’s patur, as it says, “and to the opening of the tent of meeting they were not brought,” whatever is not fit to come to the opening of the tent of meeting, one is not chayav for it (not being done in the proper place).
Bet: A rove’a (animal a woman had sex with), a nirba (that had sex with a man), one that is designated (for avoda zara), worshiped (by avoda zara), the hire of a prostitute, one worth the value of a dog, one that is kilayim (mixed species), a trefa (animal which has internal invalidations), or an animal delivered by Caesarian section which one offered outside, he’s patur, as it says, “before the Mishkan (tabernacle) of Hashem,” whatever isn’t fit before the Mishkan of Hashem, one is not chayav for.  Those (animals which are blemished, whether those which have permanent blemishes or those which have temporary blemishes, which one offered outside, he’s patur.  Rabi Shimon says, those which have permanent blemishes are patur, and those which have temporary blemishes, they transgress a lo ta’ase.  Turtledoves which did not reach their time (proper age) and young doves whose time has passed which he offered outside, he’s patur.  Rabi Shimon says, young doves whose time has passed, he’s patur, but turtledoves which did not reach their time, (he transgresses) a lo ta’ase.  One and its child (there is a prohibition against slaughtering a mother and child animal on the same day) and one which is missing time (is not old enough) is patur (if offered outside).  Rabi Shimon says, behold this is (transgressing) a lo ta’ase, for Rabi Shimon used to say, whatever is fit to be offered after time behold it is (transgressing) a lo ta’ase, and there is no karet in it.  But the Chachamim say, whatever has no karet has no lo ta’ase in it.
Gimmel: One (an offering) that is missing time is whether it itself (is missing time) or its owner (is missing time).  Which is missing time in its owner?  (An owner who is) a zav, a zava, one who just gave birth, or metzora, if they offered their chata’ot or ashamim outside, they are patur, but (if they offered) their olot or shlamim outside, they are chayav.  One who offers from the flesh of a chatat, the flesh of an asham, the flesh of the holies of holies, the meat of light holies, the leftovers of an omer, the two breads, the showbreads, the leftovers of menachot, pours oil (on a mincha), mixes in the oil, crumbles it, salts, brings to an altar, set a table (with showbread), fixes candles (on a menorah), takes a handful (of a mincha), or collects blood (from a korban) outside it patur,  One is not chayav for it because of being a zar (non-kohen), not because of being tame, not because of lacking garments (those of temple service), and not because of (not having) washed hands and feet.
Daled: Before the Mishkan was established, the bamot (private altars) were allowed, and service was done by firstborns.  After the Mishkan was established, bamot were prohibited, and the service was done by the kohanim.  The holies of holies were eaten within the curtains (of the Mishkan) and the light holies were (eaten) in any of the camp of Yisra’el.
Hay: When they came to the Gilgal (entered Israel with Yehoshu’a) the bamot became allowed.  The holies of holes were eaten within the curtains, and the light holies in any place.
Vav: When they came to Shilo (where the Mishkan was stationed in Israel), the bamot were prohibited.  There was no ceiling there, rather their was a house of stone below (comprising the building) and curtains above, and it was rested there.  The holies of holies were eaten within the curtains and the light holies and ma’aser sheni were eaten wherever could see,
Zayin: When they came to Nov (where they set up a Mishkan after Shilo was destroyed) and to Givon (which succeeded Nov) the bamot were allowed, the holies of holies were eaten within the curtains, and the light holies in any city in Israel.
Chet: When they came to Yerushalayim (the Beit Hamikdash), the bamot were prohibited and they din’d have another (period of) permission, and it (Yerushalayim) was its portion.  The holies of holies were eaten within the curtains and the light holies and ma’aser sheni within the wall (of Yerushalayim).
Tet: Any korbanot one made hekdesh in the time of prohibition of bamot and offered outside in a time of prohibition of bamot, behold these are (a transgression upon) an ase and a lo ta’ase, and one is chayav karet for them.  If he made them hekdesh in a time of allowance of bamot and offered them in a time of prohibition of bamot, behold these are an ase and a lo ta’ase, but one is not chayav karet for them.  If he made them hekdesh in a time of prohibition of bamot and offered them in a time of allowance of bamot, behold they are an ase, but there is no lo ta’ase in it.
Yud: These holies were offered in the Mishkan, holies which were made hekdesh for the Mishkan, public korbanot were offered in the Mishkan, but korbanot of the individual (were offered) on the bama.  The korbanot of an individual that were made hekdesh for the Mishkan should be offered in the Mishkan, but if he offered them on a bama, he’s patur.  What is the difference between an individual’s bama and a public bama (the Mishkan)?  Laying hands (on the korban), slaughtering in the north (part of the courtyard), giving (sprinkling blood) around (the bama), waving (a mincha), presenting (a mincha to the kohen), (though) Rabi Yehuda says there is no (offering of a) mincha on a bama, the service of the kohen, the clothes of service, the service vessels, the pleasant smell (burning of certain parts of a korban), the divider of blood (a red line which divided the top and bottom of the mizbe’ach), and the (need for) washing of hands and feet.  But (invalidation due to) time, leftovers, and (a korban becoming) tame are the same in both.
