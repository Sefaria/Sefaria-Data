Aleph: The four categories of damages (are), the ox, the hole, the maveh (animal which eats crops), and the fire.  The ox is not like the maveh, and not like the maveh is like the ox (the mishna is explaining that each category is different).  And this and that, which have in them (the damage) the spirit of life are not like the fire which does not have the spirit of life.  And this and that (the three mentioned categories), the way of which is to go and damage, are not like the pit, for its way is not to go and damage.  The side that is similar in them (all four categories) is that their way is to damage and one must guard them.  And when they damage, the damager is chayav to pay restitution for the damage with the best of the land (idit lands).
Bet: All which I (any person) is obligated in guarding it, I caused its damage.  If I caused part of its damage, I became chayav in the restitution as if I caused all of the damage.  Objects which do not have me’ila (misappropriation of holy property), property of the people of the covenant (Jews), property which is designated (to owners), and in any place, except for the domain designated for the damager, a domain (shared by) the damaged and the damager, and when he damaged, the damager is chayav to pay restitution with the best of the land.
Gimmel: We assess the money (meaning all damage is assessed and then the net is paid), monetary value (is paid from property also), (damages are paid after a ruling) before a court, and based on witnesses who are free men and people of the covenant, and women are included in the (laws of) damage.  And the damaged and the damager (sometimes share) the restitution (sometimes the damager only pays part).
Daled: Five are tam (simple, the status an ox has if unwarned) and five are mu’ad (forewarned).  An animal is not mu’ad (without any warning) not for goring, not for its body (banging into things), not for biting, not for lying (on something), and not for kicking.  The tooth is mu’ad for something that is fit for it (to eat), the foot is mu’ad to break something while walking, a mu’ad ox (who has done one action three times), an ox who has damaged in the domain of the damaged (even if it has never been warned is considered mu’ad), and a person (who is held to a higher standard).  The wolf, the lion, the bear, the tiger, the panther, ad the snake, behold they are mu’ad.  Rabi Eliezer says, when they are those of culture (domesticated), they are not mu’ad, but the snake is always mu’ad.  What is the difference between tam an mu’ad?  Only that the tam pays half the damage from itself (the damaging ox is sold and the money is used to pay back), and the mu’ad pays the full damage from the best lands.
