Aleph: These are young women who have a fine (for raping, for only virgins incur a fine), one who has sex with a mamzeret, a netina, a kutit, a convert, (a woman who was) a captive, or a maidservant who was redeemed, converted, or freed (the past three cases) less than three years and one day old.  One who has sex with his sister, his father’s sister, his mother’s sister, his wife’s sister, his brother’s wife, his father’s brother’s wife, and a nidda, they have a fine, even though they get karet, (for) they do not have (a punishment of) death by the court.
Bet: And these don’t have a fine, one who has sex with a convert, a (woman who was a) captive, or a maidservant who was redeemed, converted, or freed, (and all these) more than three years and one day old.  Rabi Yehuda says, a captive who was redeemed, she retains her purity even though she was an adult.  One who has sex with his daughter, his daughter’s daughter, his son’s daughter, his wife’s daughter, her (his wife’s) son’s daughter, her daughter’s daughter, they have no fine, since they make him chayav by his life, for his death is by the court.  And all who are chayav by their lives do not pay money, as it says, “and if there is no disaster (fatality) he shall be punished.”
Gimmel: A young girl who was betrothed and divorced, Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, she has no fine.  Rabi Akiva says, she has a fine, and her fine is hers (not her fathers).
Daled: A seducer gives three things (payments) and the rapist four, the seducer gives (restitution for), embarrassment, stigma, and fine, and the rapist adds on it for he pays distress.  What is the difference between a rapist and a seducer?  The rapist pays distress and the seducer does not pay distress, the rapist pays immediately and the seducer pays when he exits (the marriage, for may marry the woman he seduces), and a rapist drinks from his clay pot (he must marry the woman forever) and the seducer, if he wants to exit, he exits.
Hay: How does he drink from his clay pot (meaning even if it gets disgusting)?  Even if she is lame, even if she is blind, and even if she has boils (he must marry her forever).  If some sort of inappropriate relationship was found, or if she is not fit to have sex with a yisra’el, he is not allowed to keep her, as it says, “and for him she will be a wife,” a wife fit for him.
Vav: An orphan who was betrothed and then divorced, Rabi Elazar says, one who entices is patur, but the rapist is chayav.
Zayin: What is embarrassment?  All is upon the embarrassed and embarrasser.  Stigma?  We see her as if she were a maidservant being sold, how much she was worth, And how much she is worth (now).  The fine is equal in all people.  Anything which has a fixed amount from the torah is equal for everyone.
Chet: Everywhere where there is a sale (a father selling his daughter as a maidservant), there is no fine, and everywhere where there is a fine, there is no sale.  A minor girl who has a sale but not fine and a young woman has a fine but no sale.  A full-grown woman has no sale and no knas.
Tet: One who says, I seduced the daughter of such and such pays embarrassment and stigma based on himself  (his own admission), but he does not pay the fine.  One who says, I stole and slaughtered or sold, pays the principle based on himself and does not pay kefel restitution or the four or five restitutions.  My ox killed so-and-so or so-and-so’s ox, behold he pays based on himself.  My ox killed so-and-so’s slave, behold he does not pay because of himself (since what he pays is only a fine).  This is the general rule, all who pay more than what they damaged do not pay based on themselves.
