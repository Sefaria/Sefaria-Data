Aleph: If they (the court) don’t know him (the witness) they send another with him to testify (about) him.  Originally, they would accept testimony about the new moon from anyone, when the heretics messed it up, they established that they would only accept from who they knew.
Bet: Originally, they would light flares, when the kutim messed it up, they established that messengers would go out.
Gimmel: How would they light flares?  They would bring long rods of cedar, reeds, oil wood (either a certain tree or a reference to olive wood), and chips of flax; they would tie it together with rope; go up the hill and set them on fire; and (wave) send (out) and bring (close to him), raise, and lower until he sees his friend, for they would do such on top of the second hill, and so too on top of the third hill (etc.).
Daled: And from where did they light flares?  From the Mount of Olives to Sarteva, from Sarteva to Agrippina, from Agrippina to Chavran, from Chavran to Beit Blitin, and from Beit Blitin they didn’t move, rather he would send, bring, raise, and lower until he saw the entire exile before him like a bonfire (the people in Pumpedita would see this and light torches on their roves to indicate such).
Hay: There was a large courtyard in Yerushalayim and it was called Beit Yazek, and the witnesses would assemble there and Beit Din would check them there.  And they would make big meals for them so they would be regular to come.  At first (if they came on Shabbat), they (the witnesses) wouldn’t move from there the whole day, (and then) Raban Gamliel established that they could go 2,000 amot in any direction.  And not just these (got the allowance), rather also a midwife who comes to deliver and one who comes to save from a fire, troops, a river, or a collapsed building, these are like the people of the city, and they have 2,000 amot in any direction.
Vav: How would they check the witnesses?  The pair that came first, they check it first, and they bring in the greater of them (to a chamber for interviewing) and say to him, say, how did you see the moon, before the sun or after the sun (i.e. was the crescent facing towards or away from the sun)?  To the north or the south?  How high was it and where was it leaning?  And how wide was it?  If he said, before the sun, he said nothing (for the dark part, the crescent is always away from the sun).  After that they would bring in the other and check him.  If their words were found to be in accord, their testimony stands.  And the rest of all the pairs they would ask them the main points, not that they needed them, rather so they won’t go out disappointed, such that they would be regular to come.
Zayin: The head of the court says, it is sanctified.  And the entire nation answers after him, it is sanctified.  Whether it was seen in its time or it wasn’t seen in its time (if the court knew that it had to be the new month by then and therefore could declare without witness) they would sanctify it.  Rabi Elazar ben Tzadok says, if it was not seen in its time, they do not sanctify it, for Heaven has already sanctified it.
Chet: Raban Gamliel had representations of the forms of the moon on a chart and on the wall in his upper chamber, and with them he would show the laypeople and say, did you see it like this or like this?  Once two came and said, we saw it in the east in the morning and the west in the evening.  Rabi Yochanan ben Nuri said, they are testifying falsely.  When they came to Yavne, Raban Gamliel accepted them.  And furthermore, two came and said, we saw it in its time (the thirtieth) and in the night of its addition (the thirty-first) we did not see it, and Raban Gamliel accepted them.  Rabi Dosa ben Harkinas said, they are false witnesses.  How can they testify about a woman that she gave birth, and the next day that she has her belly between her teeth (she is pregnant)?  Rabi Yehoshua said to him, I see (merit in) your opinion (and consider the thirty-first to be Rosh Chodesh).
Tet: Raban Gamliel sent (a message) to him (Rabi Yehoshua), I decreed upon you that you should come to me with your staff and your money on the Yom Hakippurim which falls out according top your calculation.  Rabi Akiva went out and found him distressed, and said to him, I can learn that everything which Raban Gamliel has done is done, as it says, “these are the times of Hashem, declarations of sanctification, which you shall declare,” whether on time or not on time, and I have no times other than these.  He came by Rabi Dosa ben Harkinas, he (Rabbi Dosa ben Harkinas) said to him, if we come to judge after (investigate) the court of Raban Gamliel, we have to judge after every court which has stood from the times of Moshe until now, as it says, “and Moshe, Aaron, Nadav, Avihu, and the seventy elders went up.”  And why didn’t it expound the names of the elders?  Rather to teach that every three who stood to be a court over Yisra’el, behold it is like the court of Moshe.  He took his staff and money in his hand and went to Yavne by Raban Gamliel on the day which fell out to be Yom Hakippurim on his calculations.  Raban Gamliel stood and kissed him on his head and said to him, come in peace, my master and my student.  My master in wisdom and my student that you accepted my words.
