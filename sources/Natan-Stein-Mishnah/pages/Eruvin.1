Aleph: A mavoy (an alley with courtyards, which are private domains, around it) which has a height (the entrance) of greater than ten amot, he must reduce it.  That which is wider than ten amot, must be reduced.  But if it has the form of an entry, even though it is wider than ten amot, one doesn’t need to reduce it.
Bet: Making a mavoy fit, Beit Shamay says, a lechi (poles surrounding the entrance) and a kora (a beam as a distinctive marker), and Beit Hillel says, a lechi or a kora.  Rabi Eliezer says, two lechi.  In the name of Rabi Yishma’el one student said in front of Rabi Akiva, Beit Hillel and Beit Shamay didn’t disagree about a mavoy which is less than four amot, which is with either a lechi or a kora.  One what did they argue about?  Wider than four until ten, for Beit Shamay says a lechi (poles surrounding the entrance) and a kora (a beam as a distinctive marker), and Beit Hillel says a lechi or a kora.  Rabi Akiva said, they argued about both.
Gimmel: The kora they talked about, it’s wide enough to accept (pass through) an arich, and an arich is half of a brick three tfachim wide  It is sufficient for a kora that it will be a tefach wide, in order to accept an arich by its length.
Daled: If it is wide enough to accept an arich, and strong enough to accept an arich, Rabi Yehuda says, wide, even if it isn’t strong (since he holds it is simply a partition).
Hay: If it was of straw or reeds, we consider it as if it is made of metal.  If it’s bent, we see it as if it’s straight.  Round, we see it as if it’s a square.  Whatever has a circumference of three tfachim, it has the width of a tefach.
Vav: The lechis of which they said, their height is ten tfachim, and their width and depth is any amount.  Rabi Yossi says, their width is three tfachim.
Zayin: One may make lechis out of anything, even something which is alive, and Rabi Yossi prohibits this.  It becomes tame from golel (covering a grave), and Rabi Meir makes it (always) tahor.  And one may write on it a get for a woman, but Rabi Yossi Hagelili prohibits this.
Chet: A caravan which encamped in a valley and they encircled it with vessels for animals, one may carry in it, as long as there it forms a wall taller than ten tfachim and the gaps don’t exceed the building (there is more eruv than not).  Any gap which is about ten amot is allowed, because it is like an entrance.  Anything more than that is assur.
Tet: One may surround with three ropes, this on top of that and this on top of that, as long as between them there isn’t three tfachim.  The measurement of the ropes and their thickness is more than a tefach, so the whole thing can be ten tfachim.
Yud: One may surround with reeds, as long as there isn’t three tfachim between one reed and the next one.  They’re speaking about a caravan according to Rabi Yehuda.  Chachamim say, they’re not talking about a caravan but rather a current case.  Any partition which isn’t of a warp and a weft isn’t a partition according to Rabi Yossi bar Rabi Yehuda.  Chachamim say, one of them (is sufficient, seeing as rope is like a weft and reeds are like a warp).  There are four things the allowed in a camp (of soldiers), one may bring (take) wood from anywhere (and it’s not stealing), they’re patur from washing their hands (before a meal), from dmai, and from making an eruv.
