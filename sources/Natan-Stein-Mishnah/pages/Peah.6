Aleph: Beit Shamay says if you make something hefker for the poor, it’s hefker.  Beit Hillel says it’s only hefker if you make it even for rich people, like shmitta.  If all of the bundles are a kav and one is four kabin and you forget it, Beit Shamay says it’s not shichicha, and Beit Hillel says it is.
Bet: A heap close to an uncemented wall, a pile of grain, cattle, vessels, and he forgot it, Beit Shamay says it isn’t shichicha and Beit Hillel says it is.
Gimmel: Beit Hillel admit that a bundle at the beginning of a row that he will find when collecting in the opposite direction, which he left when he went to town, is not shichicha.
Daled: These are ‘the beginning of a row’: two starting from the middle of the row and collecting in opposite directions, anything they face can be shichicha, but anything they don’t isn’t, the other will collect it.  One person goes through a row himself, what is in from of him isn’t shichicha, and what is behind him is.  This is the general rule, everything that ‘bal tashuv’ applies to is shichicha, and what it doesn’t apply to isn’t.
Hay: Two bundles are shichicha, but not three.  Same with heaps of olives or carobs, stalks of flax, grapes (which are technically peret), and stalks of grain (leket).  This is according to Beit Hillel.  And on all of the Beit Shamay says three s for the poor, but four is for the owner.
Vav: A bundle that is two se’ah isn’t shichicha. Two such bundles, Raban Gamliel says for the owner, Chachamim say for the poor.  Raban Gamliel said, how can more bundles give the owner less right?  They said this isn’t a kal vechomer, one bundle can be like a heap, which isn’t shichicha, but two bundles are bundles, so they’re shichicha.
Zayin: Standing grain which was two se’ah and forgotten isn’t shichicha.  If it’s not two se’ah, but it’s enough crop that it could have produces two se’ah, even if it is shriveled and not close, it is considered like proper, plump barley.
Chet: Standing grain saves other standing grain and bundles next to it (from becoming shichicha).  A bundle saves neither.  What standing grain saves a bundle?  Whatever isn’t shichicha, even one stalk.
Tet: A se’ah each of plucked and unplucked grain, and likewise with trees, garlic, and onions, do not come together to make two se’ah, and are for the poor.  Rabi Yossi says, if any other things of the poor separate them, they do not combine, but if nothing else does, they do combine.
Yud: Grain used to feed animals or tie bundles, and similarly for garlic greens used to tie garlic or onions are not shichicha.  And all tubers, Rabi Yehuda says they can’t become shichicha, and Chachamim say they can.
Yud Aleph: One who harvests at night, or bundles at night, or is blind has shichicha.  But if he intended only to take the large bundles, the small ones aren’t shichicha.  If he says that he is harvesting and will come back for what he forgets, he still has shichicha.
