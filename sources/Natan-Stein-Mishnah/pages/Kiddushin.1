Aleph: A woman is acquired (betrothed) in three ways, and she acquires herself (regains independence) in two ways.  She is acquired with money, a document, or relations.  With money – Beit Shamay says, with a dinar or with (things which are) worth a dinar.  Beit Hillel says, with a pruta, or worth a pruta.  And how much is a pruta?  One of eight (an eighth) of an Italian issar (which makes a pruta worth 1/192 of a dinar).  And she acquires herself with a get (divorce document) or with the death of her husband.  A yevama (one whose husband died without having children, so she has a child with her husband’s brother) is acquired (by the yavam, the husband’s brother) with (only) relations.  And she acquires herself with chalitza (a process which signifies a rejection of yibum) and with the death of the yavam.
Bet: An Ivri (Jewish) slave is acquired with money and with a document.  And he acquires himself with years (six years if he was sold by the court), yovel (all Ivri slaves are automatically released on the fiftieth year of the yovel cycle), or by a monetary reduction (he can pay part of what he owes to reduce his term of service).  An Ivri handmaid is greater than him in that she acquires herself with signs (of puberty, after which she goes free).  One who is pierced (in the ear to symbolize that he does not wish to leave his master after his term) is acquired by piercing.  And he (the pierced) acquires himself by yovel and the death of the master.
Gimmel: A Cana’ani slave s acquired with money, a document, and chazaka (if he already does tasks for the owner).  And he acquires himself with money at the hands of others (others pay), and with a document on his own hands (if the master releases him) according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, with money on his own hands, and with a document at the hands of others, as long as the money is that of others.
Daled: A large animal (cattle) is acquired with mesira (handing over, for other forms such as raising are not practical), and a small one (flock) with hagba’a (raising) according to Rabi Meir and Rabi Elazar.  Chachamim say, a small animal is acquired (even) by meshicha (pulling to another place).
Hay: Property which has security (referring to land for it is security on loans) is acquired with money, a document, and with chazaka (making an act of ownership).  And those which do not have security, they are not acquired except with meshicha.  Property which does not have security is acquired with property which has security (if they are acquired together, one may acquire with) money, a document, and chazaka.  And property which does not have security (make a) requirement for a swear about property which has security (we do not usually make swears about land, but if we are already swearing about non-land, we add a swear for land.
Vav: All which is made the money of the other (evaluated as fit to be traded for some other thing), since he (the seller) merited this, he owes this (the object being traded for) as a chaliphin (trade).  How?  He traded an ox for a cow, or a donkey for an ox, because this one (the seller) merited, he owes this as a trade.  The higher right (treasury of the Beit Hamikdash acquires necessary objects) with money, and the layman’s right (title he has  he acquires) with chazaka.  What he says to the high (right) is like what he hands over to the layman (declaring something for the Beit Hamikdash is like handing it over).
Zayin: All mitzvot of the son (which deal which the son and the responsibility falls) on the father, men are chayav and women are patur.  And all mitzvot of the father on the son, whether men or women, they are chayav.  And all mizvot ase shehazman grama (positive commandments which have a set time), men are chayav and women are patur.  And all positive mitzvot which do not have defined time, whether men or women, they are chayav.  And al negative commandments, whether there is a set time or there is no set time, whether men or women they are chayav, except for, “do not destroy (the corners of your beard, which women do not do,” “you shall not round (the corners of your hair),” and, “do not become tame for the dead (for male kohanim only).”
Chet: Leaning (on a korban), waving, bringing near (adding things to a mincha), taking up handfuls (of a mincha), smoking (of incense), pinching of necks (of bird offerings), sprinkling (blood), and accepting (collecting the blood of a sacrifice), are done with men and not with women, except for the mincha of a sota and a nezira, for they wave.
Tet: Any mitzva which is dependant on the land, isn’t done except in the land (of Israel), and (a mitzva) which is not dependant on the land is done whether in the land or outside of the land, except from orla and kilayim (which while dependant on the land are done outside Israel).  Rabi Eliezer says, also from chadash (grain which there has not been a Pesach since its harvesting, making it assur).
Yud: All who do one mitzva is rewarded and they lengthen his days (life) and he inherits the land (the World to Come).  And all who do not do one mitzva, they do not reward him, they do not lengthen his days, and he does not inherit the land.  All who have (knowledge) in the torah, the mishna, and the ways of the world (proper actions), he does not sin quickly, as it says, “and the string is tripled, it does not quickly disconnect.”  And all who are not in the torah, not mishna, and not the ways of the world, he is not one of those of the settlement (settled community, and derives no benefit from them).
