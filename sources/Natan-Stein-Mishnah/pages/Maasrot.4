Aleph: One who pickles, stews, or salts in a field is chayav ma’aser.  One who stores in the ground is patur.  One who dips (food) in the field is patur (it isn’t considered a finishing process).  One who bruises olives to get out sap is patur.  One who squeezes olives onto his skin is part.  If he squeezed them and put into his hand, he’s chayav.  One who skims (wine) into a cooked dish is patur, but into a cooking pot is chayav, because it is seen as a small vat.
Bet: Children who hid figs for Shabbat and forgot to take ma’asrot, they may not be eaten post Shabbat until ma’asrot are taken.  A large basket for Shabbat, Beit Shamay holds it’s patur (if one wants to snack from it before Shabbat), and Beit Hillel hold it’s chayav.  Rabi Yehuda says, even one who collects a large basket for his friend may not eat until he takes ma’asrot.
Gimmel: One who takes olives from a vat may dip into salt one by one and eat, but if he salted and then took, he’s chayav.  Rabi Eliezer says, if (a tame person) took from a tahor vat, he’s chayav, but from a tame vat, he’s patur, because he’s able to put them back (even after salting).
Daled: One who drinks from a winepress (while sitting in the upper part), whether he mixed warm or cold (water), he’s patur according to Rabi Meir. Rabi Elazar ben Tzadok says you’re chayav.  Chachamim say, if it’s hot it’s chayav (since he wouldn’t be able to pour it back), if cold, it’s patur.
Hay: One who husks barley may husk one by one and eat.  If he husked and put in his hand, he’s chayav.  One who rubs dried wheat (to get the chaff off) may pass from hand to hand and eat.  But if he sifted (with his hands, as before) and put into his lap, he’s chayav.  By coriander which one sowed to get the seed, the cilantro is patur.  If he sowed it for cilantro, both coriander and cilantro must be me’usar.  Rabi Eliezer says, by dill, the seed, greens, and thin stalks must be me’usar.  Chachamim say, he doesn’t take ma’aser from the seed or greens except for in the case of pepperwort and eruca.
Vav: Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, the shoots of fenugreek, mustard, and white beans are chayav in ma’asrot.  Rabi Eliezer says, the caper is me’usar in the stalks, berries, and flowers.  Rabi Akiva says, One only takes ma’aser from the berries, for that is the fruit.
