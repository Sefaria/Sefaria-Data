Aleph: A place where their custom is to do melacha on the eve of Pesach until midday they do, and a place where their custom is not to do, they don’t do.  One who goes from a place where they do to a place where they don’t do or vice versa, we give upon him the stringencies of the place he left and the stringencies of the place he is.  And a person shouldn’t do differently, because (it causes) disagreement.
Bet: Similarly, one who takes shvi’it produce from a place where it finished (and needed biur, removal from the house) to a place it didn’t finish or vice versa, he must remove it.  Rabi Yehuda says, they tell him, go out and bring even for yourself (the meaning of this statement is disputed).
Gimmel: A place where their custom was to sell small cattle (sheep and the like) to non-Jews, one may sell.  In a place where their custom is not to sell, one may not sell.  And nowhere may one sell them a big animal (cows etc.), calves, or young donkeys, whole or broken (healthy or not), and Rabi Yehuda allows a broken.  Ben Bteira allows by a horse.
Daled: A place where it is their custom to eat roasted meat on erev Pesach, one may eat.  A place where it is their custom not to eat, one may not eat.  In a place where it is their custom to light a candle on erev Yom Kippur, one lights.  In a place where it is their custom not to light, one does not light.  And one lights in shuls, a Beit Midrash, dark alleys, and for the sick.
Hay: In a place where it is their custom to do melacha on Tisha B’Av one does.  In a place where it is their custom not to do work, one does not do.  And in all places torah scholars are idle (from their studies).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, one should always make himself a torah scholar.  Chachamim said, in Yehuda they used to do work on erev Pesach until midday, and in the Galil they would not do (work) at all.  And the evening (before), Rabi Shamay prohibits and Beit Hillel allows until sundown.
Vav: Rabi Meir says, any melacha which he started before the fourteenth he may finish on the fourteenth, but he may not start at the beginning of the fourteenth, even if he can finish it (before melacha has to stop).  Chachamim say, three craftsmen may do melacha on erev Pesach until midday, and they are tailors, barbers, and launderers.  Rabi Yossi bar Yehuda says, also leather workers.
Zayin: One may place eggs to be incubated under chickens on the fourteenth, and a chicken which escapes may be returned to its place.  If it died, one may put another instead of it.  One may rake under the legs of animals (to collect the manure) on the fourteenth, and on Chol Hamo’ed one may remove (the manure) on its sides.  One may take and bring back utensils from the workshop, even though they are not for the purpose of Chol Hamo’ed.
Chet: Six (objectionable) things which the people of Yericho did, on three they were warned on three they were not warned.  These are those they weren’t warned for, they would graft palm trees all day (erev Pesach), they shortened shma, and they harvested and stacked before the omer, and they didn’t warn them.  And for these they did warn them, they permitted (the fruit of) soft branches which grew on (carobs and sycamores, which because of fear of robbers cutting down the trunk were made) hekdesh, they ate from the fallen fruits on Shabbat, and they gave pe’ah from vegetables (which would give an undue exemption from ma’aser), and for there they  were warned.
Tet: Chizkiyahu the king did six things, for three they agreed with him, and for three they didn’t agree with him.  He dragged the bones of his father on a bed of ropes (since he was a bad king) and they agreed with him, he crushed the brass snake and they agreed with him, and he hid the book of curse and they agreed with him.  The three for which they did not agree with him he cut down the doors of the sanctuary and sent them to the king of Ashur and they didn’t agree with him, he stopped the waters of the upper Gichon and they didn’t agree with him, and he did ibur for Nissan in Nissan (turned it into Adar bet) and they didn’t agree with him.
