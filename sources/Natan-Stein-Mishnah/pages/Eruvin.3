Aleph: With anything one may make an eruv and participate, except with water and salt.  Anything may be bought with ma’aser money, except for water and salt.  One who makes an oath against food may have water and salt.  One may make an eruv with a nazir with wine and a yisra’el with truma, Sumchos says, (only) with chulin.  (One may make) with a kohen in a beit pras (an area around a plowed up grave, which is assur to a kohen).  Rabi Yehuda says, even in a graveyard, for he can go outside and eat it.
Bet: One may make an eruv with dmai, with ma’aser rishon from which truma has been taken, with ma’aser sheni and hekdesh which have been redeemed, and kohanim with challa and truma, but not with tevel, ma’aser rishon from which truma hasn’t been taken, or ma’aser sheni or hekdesh which haven’t been redeemed.  One who sends eruvin in the hand of a deaf-mute, mentally infirm person, or minor, or to one who doesn’t accept an eruv, it’s not an eruv.  And if he said to another to receive the eruv from him (the assur people) it’s an eruv.
Gimmel: If they put it in a tree higher than ten tfachim, it’s not an eruv, lower than ten tfachim, it’s an eruv.  If they put it in a pit, even if it’s a hundred amot deep, it’s an eruv.  If they put it on a reed or a pole, if it was detached (from the round) and then stuck in, even if it was taller than a hundred amot, it’s an eruv.  They put it on a tower and lost the key, this is an eruv.  Rabi Eliezer says, if he doesn’t know that the key is in his place, it’s not an eruv.
Daled: If it rolled out of the city limit, and a mound fell on it or it burnt, or it is truma which became tame, if it’s during the day, it’s not an eruv, but if it’s since it became dark, it is an eruv.  If it’s a doubt, Rabi Meir and Rabi Yehuda say, it is like a person riding a donkey and a camel (an idiom meaning both are useless, and he may not trust any eruvim which are like this, and may therefore not walk more than 2,000 amot from his home or from the city limits).  Rabi Yossi and Rabi Shimon say, a doubtful eruv is valid.  Rabi Yossi said, Avtulmos testified based on five elders that a doubtful eruv is valid.
Hay: A person may (set down two eruvim and) make conditions on an eruv, by saying, if non-Jews came from the east, my eruv is in the west (so I can flee), if from the west, my eruv is in the east, if they come from both, my eruv is where I’ll want it, and if they come from neither, I am like the people of my city (who set no eruv).  (He may also say) if a wise person comes from the east, my eruv is in the east, if from the west, my eruv is from the west, if from both ways, my eruv is where I’ll want it, and if from neither, I am like the people of my city.  Rabi Yehuda says, if one of them was his rabbi, he walks to his rabbi, and if both are his rabbis, he goes where he pleases.
Vav: Rabi Eliezer says, a Yom Tov which is next to Shabbat, whether before or after, one may make two eruvim and say, the eruv for the first (day I need to carry) is in the east and the second in the west, the first is for the west and the second for the east, may eruv is for the first and the second I am like the people of my city, or my eruv is for the second and the first I am like the people of my city.  Chachamim say, one makes an eruv for one direction or he doesn’t make an eruv at all, and one makes for two days, or he doesn’t make an eruv at all.  How does he do it?  He sets the first day and when it becomes nightfall, he brings it (home) and on the second, nightfall comes and he eats from it.  (If so,) we find he benefits (from the eruv) by his walking and his eruv (eating it).  If he ate on the first, his eruv is for the first and not an eruv for the second (day).  Rabi Eliezer said to them, you admit to me there may be two holies (as you need one for each day, you may have one for each direction).
Zayin: Rabi Yehuda says, Rosh Hashana  which he feared might have ibur (pushing off by one day), one may make two eruvim and say, the eruv for the first (day) is for the east and the for second for the west, for the first for the west and for the second for the east, my eruv is for the first, and on the second I am like the people of the city, or, my eruv is for the second and on the first I am like the people of the city.  And the Chachamim didn’t agree with him.
Chet: Furthermore said Rabi Yehuda, one may make a condition on a large basket (of tevel, which he makes some terms about the timing of his taking truma) on the first day of Yom Tov and eat it on the second.  And so too with an egg which was laid on the first, it may be eaten on the second.  And the Chachamim didn’t agree with him.
Tet: Rabi Dosa ben Harkinos says, one who is the shatz (leader of prayers) on the Yom Tov of Rosh Hashana says, strengthen us Hashem our God on this day of Rosh Chodesh, whether today or tomorrow.  And the next day he says, if today or yesterday, and the Chachamim didn’t agree with him.
