Aleph: The order of the (prayer on the last seven) fasts how (was it done)?  They take out the ark to the street of the city, and they put ashes from wood on the ark, the head of the president (a community leader), the head of the head of the court, and everyone puts on his own head.  The eldest of them says before them words of rebuke for repentance (saying), brothers, it was not said by the people of Ninve (a city of sinners who repented due to the warnings of Yona), and Hashem saw their sackcloth and their fasting, but rather, “and Hashem saw their deeds, for they returned from their evil ways,” and in other prophets he says, “and tear your hearts and not your clothes.”
Bet: They would stand in prayer, send down before the ark an elder and a (person) regular (to prayer) and he has children and his house is empty (he can’t support them), such that his heart will be wholly in prayer.  And he say before them (the people) twenty-four blessings, eighteen for everyday, and he adds on another six.
Gimmel: And these are they (the blessings added), zichronot, shofarot, “to Hashem in my distress I called and he answered me,” “I will raise my eyes to the mountains etc.”  “from the depths I called to You Hashem,” and, “prayer for the poor for he wraps (himself in prayer).”  Rabi Yehuda says, he shouldn’t say zichronot and shofarot, rather he should stay instead of them, “hunger when it will be in the land, disease when it will be etc.” and “for the word of Hashem came to Yirmiyahu because of the droughts,” and he says their seals (of the blessings).
Daled: On the first he says, “He who answered Avraham on the Moriah Mountain, He will answer you and listen to the voice of your screams today.  Blessed are You Hashem, the savior of Yisra’el.”  On the second he says, “He who answered our forefathers on the Yam Suf (which was split) He will answer you and listen to the voice of your screams today.  Blessed are You Hashem, who remembers the forgotten.”  On the third he says, “He who answered Yehoshu’a in the Gilgal (victory in the battle for Yericho with shofarot) He will answer you and listen to the voice of your screams today.  Blessed are You Hashem, who hears the tru’a.”  On the fourth he says, “He who answered Shmu’el in Mitzpeh (where he was answered) He will answer you and listen to the voice of your screams today.  Blessed are You Hashem, who listens for screams.”  On the fifth he says, “He who answered Eliyahu on Carmel Mountain, He will answer you and listen to the voice of your screams today.  Blessed are You Hashem, He who listens to prayer.”  On the sixth he says, “He who answered Yon from the bowels of the fish, He will answer you and listen to the voice of your screams today.  Blessed are You Hashem, the one who answers in a time of distress.”  On the seventh he says, “Hew how answered David and his son Shlomo in Yerushalayim, He will answer you and listen to the voice of your screams today.  Blessed are You Hashem, the one who has mercy on the world.”
Hay: There was a story in the days of Rabi Chalafta and Rabi Chananya ben Tardyon that one of the passed before the ark and finished the entire bracha (of “savior of Yisra’el”) and they did not answer amen.  (The supervisor of the shul would say,) blow, kohanim, blow.  (The shaliach tzibur would say,) he who answered Avraham our father on Mount Moriah He will answer you and listen to the voice of your screams today.  (The supervisor of the shul would say,) sound an alarm, children of Aaron, sound an alarm.  (The shaliach tzibur would say,) He who answered your forefathers by Yam Suf He will answer you and listen to the voice of your screams today.  And when the thing came before the Chachamim they said, we would not do like this except in the eastern gat and the Temple mount.
Vav: The first three fasts, the people of the watch (that week’s kohanim) fast, but doe not complete it.  And the people of the father’s house (who would fill in for that week’s watch if necessary) do not fast at all (so they will be able to fill in).  The second (next) three, the people of the watch fast and complete, and the people of the father’s house fast and do not complete.  The last seven, both of these fast and complete, according to Rabi Yehoshua.  And the Chachamim say, the first three both of these don’t fast at all.  The second three the people of the watch fast but do not complete and the people of the father’s house don’t fast at all.  The last seven the people of the watch fast and complete and the people of the father’s house fast but don’t complete.
Zayin: The people of the watch are allowed to drink wine at night, but not in the days, and the people of the father’s house, neither the night nor the day.  The people of the watch and the people of the ma’amad (yisra’elim who were appointed to stand as representatives when the public offerings were being given) are forbidden from getting a haircut and washing clothing, but on Thursday they may out of respect for Shabbat.
Chet: All which is written in Megilat Ta’anit (a list of miracles done for the Jews during the time of the second Beit Hamikdash) not to eulogize, before it is assur, after it is mutar.  Rabi Yossi says, before and after it is assur.  (If it says) not to fast on them, before and after it is mutar.  Rabi Yossi says, before it is assur and after it is mutar.
Tet: They do not enact fasts on the public at the beginning of Thursday, so as not to raise prices (the food suppliers would only bring enough for Shabbat, not knowing there would be a fast, and when the people would buy for enough for both a Shabbat and a fast, prices would rise).  Rather, the first three fasts would be on a Monday, Thursday, and Monday (so that there would be proper information and therefore supplies), and the second (set of fasts) would be Thursday, Monday, Thursday.  Rabi Yossi says, just as the first is nor on a Thursday, so too the second and not the last (seven fasts).
Yud: They do not decree a fast on the public on Rosh Chodesh, Chanuka, or Purim.  But if they started (a cycle of fasts), they do not interrupt it, according to Raban Gamliel.  Rabi Meir said, even though Raban Gamliel said we do not interrupt it, he agreed that we would not complete it (and would cut the fast short).  And so too with Tisha B’Av which falls out on erev Shabbat (we would cut it short).
