Aleph: There are those who bring bikurim (first fruits) and recite (certain psukim), those who bring but don’t recite, and there are those who don’t bring.  Those who don’t bring are those who plants in his domain and makes runners in the domain of another or public domain, and so too one who makes runners in his domain from another’s domain or the public domain.  One who plants in his domain and made runners in his domain, and a private road or a public road is between them, this person doesn’t bring.  Rabi Yehuda says, this person brings.
Bet: For what reason does he not bring?  Since it says, “the beginning of the first fruits of your land,” until all of the growth is from your land.  Tenant farmers, lessees, people who take land by threatening the owner’s life, and robbers don’t bring for that reason, for it says, “the beginning of the first fruits of your land.”
Gimmel: One doesn’t bring bikurim except for in the seven species special to Israel (shivat haminim), not from dates of the hills, not from fruits of valleys, and not from olive oil which isn’t the best quality.  One doesn’t brink bikurim before Shavuot.  The people of Har Tzvo’im brought before Shavuot and they didn’t accept from them, since it is written in the torah, “and the holiday of the harvest, the first fruits of your work, which you have sown in the field.
Daled: These people bring and don’t recite, the convert brings but doesn’t recite, for he can’t say, “which Hashem swore to our forefathers to give us.”  And if his mother was Jewish, he may bring and recite.  And when he would with himself, he says, the God of the forefathers of Israel.  When he is in the Beit Knesset he says, the God of your forefathers.  And if his mother is Jewish he says, the God of our forefathers.
Hay: Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, the daughter of converts may not marry a kohen, until her mother is Jewish.  Whether converts or freedmen, even to ten generations, (she can only marry a kohen) if her mother is Jewish.  A guardian, messenger, slave, woman, tumtum (one who has no specific gender), and androgynous (person with characteristics of both genders) bring but don’t recite, for they can’t say, “which Hashem gave me.”
Vav: One who buys two trees in his friend’s domain, brings and doesn’t recite.  Rabi Meir says, he brings and recites.  If the spring (irrigating the field) dried up, or the tree is cut down, he brings and does not recite.  Rabi Yehuda says, he brings and declares.  From Shavuot until Sukkot, he brings and recites.  From Sukkot to Chanuka, he brings but doesn’t recite.  Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira says, he beings and recites.
Zayin: He separated bikurim and sold his field, he brings and doesn’t recite.  And the other, from the same kind (that the first person brought), he doesn’t bring.  From any other type, he beings and recites.  Rabi Yehuda says, even from the same type he brings and recites.
Chet: He separated bikurim and they were plundered, mottled, stolen, lost, or became tame, he brings others in their stead and doesn’t declare, and the replacements, he’s not chayav chomesh on them (if he eats them).  If they became tame in the Beit Hamikdash’s court, he scatters them and doesn’t recite.
Tet: And from where do we know that he’s responsible for them until he brings them to the temple mount?  As it says, “the beginning of the first fruits of your land shall you bring to the temple mount.”  It teaches that he is responsible until he brings to the temple mount.  If he brought of one type and recited and he returned and brought a different type, he doesn’t recite.
Yud: And these bring and recite, from Shavuot to Sukkot, from shivat haminim, from the fruits of the hills, from the dates of the valley, from olives for oil, and from Transjordan.  Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, one doesn’t bring bikurim from Transjordan, for it is not a land flowing with milk and honey.
Yud Aleph: One who buys three trees in his friend’s field, brings and recites.  Rabi Meir says, even two.  If he acquired a tree and land he brings and recites.  Rabi Yehuda says, even tenants and lessees bring and recite.
