Aleph: All the ineligible (people) who slaughtered, their slaughtering is valid, for slaughtering is valid with zarim, women, slaves, and people who are tame, even for the holy of holies (most holy korbanot), as long as tame people do not touch the meat.  Therefore, they can invalidate with thought (an improper intention).  And all of them who accepted the blood (with an intention for) outside its time or outside its place, if there is lifeblood (blood in vital places) one who is valid must return and accept (again).
Bet: If a valid person accepted (the blood) and he gave it to an invalid person, he must return it to the valid person.  If he accepted it in his right (hand) and put it in his left, he must return it to his right.  Id he accepted in a holy vessel and put it in a normal vessel, it is valid.  If he put it on the ramp not opposite the base, put that which is to be put on the bottom on tom, that which is to be put on top on the bottom, that which is to be put inside outside, or that which is to be put outside inside, if there is lifeblood, a valid one must return and accept.
Gimmel: One who slaughters a zevach (with an intention) to eat a thing which it is not the way of to be eaten (outside of its time or place) or to burn something which it is not the way of to be burnt, it is valid.  Rabi Eliezer invalidates.  (If he intended) to eat something the way of which is to eat or to burn something the way of which is to burn (outside its time or place) less than a kzayit, it’s valid.  To eat like half an olive and to burn like half an olive, it is valid, for eating and burning do not combine.
Daled: One who slaughters a zevach (with an intention) to eat a kzayit of the skin, the broth (from cooking it), the jelly (from boiling the meat), the offal, the bones, the sinews, the hooves, or the horns outside of its time or outside of its place, it’s valid, and one is not chayav upon it from pigul, notar (meat left over past its time), or (consuming it) tame.
Hay: One who slaughters holy things (with an intention) to eat the embryo or the afterbirth outside (its time), he did not make it pigul.  One who does molek (the squeezing of blood onto the mizbe’ach from the neck of a bird korban) on turtledoves inside in order to eat their eggs outside, he did not make it pigul. The fat of holy things and the eggs of turtledoves, one is not chayav on them from pigul, notar, or tame.
Vav: If he slaughtered it in order to leave its blood or its portions until tomorrow, or to take them outside, Rabi Yehuda invalidates, and Chachamim validate.  If he slaughtered it in order to put it (the blood) on the ramp not opposite the base, to put that which is to be put below above, that which is to be put above below, that which is to be put inside outside, that which is to be put outside inside, that people who are tame will eat it, that people who are tame will offer it, that people who are uncircumcised will eat it, that people who are uncircumcised will offer it, to break the bones of a pesach and eat from it, or to mix its blood with the blood of invalid (korbanot), it is valid, so thought does not invalidate other than outside its time or outside its place, and a pesach and chatat not for their sake.
