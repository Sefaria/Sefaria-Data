Aleph: (On) Yom Hakippurim (one is) assur by eating, drinking, bathing, anointing (with perfuming), wearing (leather) sandals, and sexual relations.  And the king and the brief may wash their faces.  A woman after childbirth may wear sandals, according to Rabi Eliezer, and Chachamim prohibit.
Bet: One who eats (the amount of) a large date including the pit and one who drinks a mouthful is chayav (karet if intentional, chatat if not).  All foods combine to (the amount of) a date and all drinks combine to (the amount of) a mouthful.  Food and drink do not combine.
Gimmel: If a person ate and drank in one fit of craziness, he is only chayav one chatat.  If he ate and did melacha, he is chayav two.  If he ate foods which aren’t fit to be eaten or drank drinks which aren’t fit to be drunk, or drank brine or fish brine, he’s patur.
Daled: Babies (referring to children), one does not make them fast on Yom Kippur, but one teaches them one year or two years before (they become adults) so that they will become regular with (keeping) the mitzvot.
Hay: A pregnant woman who smelled (and thus craved food), they feed her until she returns to herself.  A sick person, they feed him based on (the opinions of) experts.  And if there are no experts there, they feed him based on himself, until he says it’s enough.
Vav: One who was seized by bulmos (a hunger-induced ailment) they feed him even tame things until his eyes light back up.  One who was bitten by a rabid dog, they do not feed him from the lobe of its liver, and Rabi Matya ben Charash allows.  And furthermore said Rabi Matya ben Charash, one who has a sore throat, they may put medicine in his mouth on Shabbat, since it is a doubt of life, and all doubt of life and all doubt of life pushes off Shabbat.
Zayin: One who debris fell on, and it’s a doubt whether he’s there or he’s not there, there is a doubt whether he is alive or if he’s dead, it’s a doubt if he’s a Jew or he’s a non-Jew, they open the pile for him (even on Yom Kippur).If they found him alive they remove for him, if he’s dead, they leave it.
Chet: A chatat and a sure asham atone (for what they are brought).  Death and Yom Hakippurim atone with repentance.  Repentance atones on light transgressions, on a (mitzvat) ase and on a lo ta’ase, and on strict (transgressions)  it hangs until Yom Hakippurim comes and atones.
Tet: One who says, I will sin and repent, I will sin and repent, he does not have enough in his hands to repent.  (If he says)  I will sin and Yom Hakippurim will atone, Yom Hakippurim doesn’t atone.  Rabi Elazar ben Azaria expounded this, “from all of your sins before Hashem you will be made tahor,” all transgressions which are between man and Hashem, Yom Hakippurim atones, and transgressions between man and his friend, Yom Hakippurim atones until he appeases his friend.  Rabi Akiva says, you are fortunate Yisra’el, before who to you become tahor?  Who makes you tahor?  Your Father in heaven, as it says, “and I will throw upon you water that is tahor and which makes you tahor.”  And it says, “hope of Yisra’el, Hashem.”  Just as a mikva makes the tame tahor, so too the Holy one Blessed be he makes Yisra’el tahor.
