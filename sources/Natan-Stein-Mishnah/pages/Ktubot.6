Aleph: The findings of a woman and the work of her hands is for her husband.  Her inheritance (which she inherits after they are married) he eats the fruits (benefits) when she is alive.  (Payments she gets for) her embarrassment and lost work (when someone injures her) are hers.  Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira says, when they (the injuries) are hidden two parts (thirds of the payments) are for her, and one part is for him.  And when they are exposed, two parts are for him and one part for her.  His part, he takes immediately, and hers, land is purchased with them and he eats the fruit.
Bet: One who (wants to) provide money for his son-in-law (as a dowry), and his son-in-law died (so his daughter needs yibum), the Chachamim said, he can say (to the yavam), I wanted to give to your brother (his original son-in-law), but to you I don’t want to give.
Gimmel: If she (the wife) agreed to bring him (the husband, as a dowry) one thousand dinars, he provides accordingly (writes the amount of property in the ktuba of) fifteen maneh (fifteen hundred dinar, or one and a half times what she brings because he benefits from what she brings).  And opposite an appraisal (of objects she brings into marriage at the time of marriage, when it was customary for appraisers to add a fifth) he provides (the principal) less a fifth.  If it is appraised at a maneh (at some other time), and worth a maneh, he only has a maneh.  If it was appraised at a maneh, she brings (money of) thirty-one sela and one dinar (one hundred twenty-five dinars).  If at four hundred, she brings five hundred dinar.  What the husband provides, he provides less a fifth.
Daled: If she agreed to bring in money, a sela of silver (four dinars) is made (in his writing of the ktuba) six dinars.  The groom accepts upon himself ten dinars for (money for her) chest (of perfumes and cosmetics) for each maneh (she brings in to the marriage).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, everything is according to the custom of the place.
Hay: One who marries off his daughter simply (without specifying how much he will give towards the wedding) may not do less than fifty zuz.  If he (the father) stipulated to marry her unclothed (i.e. not giving her money for a dress) the husband may not say, when I will bring her into my home, I will cover her with my clothing, but clothes her when she is still in her father’s house.  And so too one who marries an orphan, he may not give her less than fifty zuz.  If he has (money) in his pocket, he supports her based on her honor.
Vav: An orphan whose mother or brother married her off with her knowledge, and they wrote for her (stipulations for a dowry of) one hundred, or fifty zuz, she can when she grows older take out from their hands what was fit to be given to her.  Rabi Yehuda says, if he (the father) married off his first daughter, it should be given to the second (who is married after the father’s death) as was given to the first.  And Chachamim say, sometimes a man is poor and becomes rich, and sometimes or is rich and becomes, rather they evaluate the property and give it to her.
Zayin: One who deposits money for his daughter (by a trustee) and she says, I trust my husband for me, the trustee does what he was assigned (to do with what was) in his hands (to follow the father and not the daughter) according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi says, and if she has nothing but a field and she wants to sell it, behold it is sold from now.  What is this talking about?  In an adult, but with a minor, the act of a minor is nothing.
