Aleph: The tamid is slaughtered at eight and a half (hours) and offered at nine and a half.  One erev Pesach it is slaughtered at seven and a half and offered at eight and a half, whether a weekday or Shabbat.  When erev Pesach falls out one erev Shabbat it is slaughtered at six and a half and offered at seven and a half, and the pesach after it.
Bet: A pesach which was slaughtered not for its sake and one accepted it and carried threw (the blood) not for its sake is pasul.  What is for its sake and (then) not for its sake?  For the sake (with the intention) of a pesach and (then) for the sake of a shlamim.  (What is) not for its sake and (then) for its sake?  For the sake of a shlamim and (then) for the sake of a pesach.
Gimmel: If they slaughtered for (people who are) not its eaters or not its participants, or for (those who are) uncircumcised or tame, it’s pasul.  For those who eat and those who don’t, for its participants and not its participants, for those circumcised and uncircumcised, or for tahor and tame, it’s kosher.  If they slaughtered before midday, it’s pasul, since it says, “bein ha’arbayim (a time which starts at six hours).”  If they slaughtered it before the tamid, provided one mixes its blood (to prevent clotting) until the blood of the tamid is sprinkled.  And if it was thrown, it’s kosher.
Daled: One who slaughters the pesach with chametz is over a lo ta’ase.  Rabi Yehuda says, even the tamid.  Rabi Shimon says, the pesach on the fourteenth for its sake is chayav, and not for its sake is patur.  And all other zvachim (sacrifices) whether for their sake or no, they’re patur.  And on Yom tov, for its sake is patur, not for its sake is chayav, and all other zvachim, whether for their sake or not, they’re chayav, except for a chatat which he slaughtered not for its sake.
Hay: The pesach was slaughtered in three groups, as it says, “and they slaughtered it all the congregation of the assembly of Israel,” congregation, assembly, and Israel.  The first group comes in, the courtyard is filled, and they lock the courtyard’s doors.  They did a tkiya, trua, tkiya (three sounds on a shofar).  The kohanim would stand in lines, and in their hands silver bowls and golden bowls.  One row was all silver and one all gold, they wouldn’t mix.  And the bowls didn’t have flat bottoms, lest they put them down and the blood will clot.
Vav: A yisra’el slaughtered and a kohen accepted (a bowl of blood), he gave it to his friend (and he) to his fiend (etc.) and they would full the empty and return the empty.  The kohen close to the altar would sprinkle one sprinkling against the base (of the altar).
Zayin: When the first group exited, the second entered.  When the second left, the third entered.  Like the doing of the first so was the doing of the second and third.  They (the levi’im) would read Hallel.  If they finished, they would repeat, and if they (finished) the repetition, they would do a third time, even though they never (needed to) do a third time.  Rabi Yehuda says, in all the days, the third group didn’t get to (the chapter of) “I love for Hashem hears,” because the people are so few (in the third group).
Chet: What they did on a weekday so they did on Shabbat, except that the kohanim would wash the courtyard against the will of the Chachamim.  Rabi Yehuda says, a cup would be filled with mixed blood (from the floor before they washed it) and would throw it on the altar, and the Chachamim did not agree with this.
Tet: How do they hang and flay?  Hooks of iron were fixed in the walls and pillars on which to hang and flay.  And everyone who doesn’t have a place to hang and flay, they had thin smooth rods there and he places it on his shoulder and his friend’s shoulder and hangs and flays.
Yud: He ribbed it (the slaughtered animal) and took out the emurim (fats to be offered on the altar), they put them in a tray and burned them on the altar.  The first group left and sat on the Temple Mount, the second in the chel (an area in the temple) and the third is standing in its place (in the courtyard).  When it got dark, they would go and roast their psachim.
