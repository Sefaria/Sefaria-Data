Aleph: One who bought from a person who isn’t ne’eman, forgot to take ma’aser, and asked the seller on Shabbat may trust the seller.  Once it’s motzei Shabbat, he can’t eat until he takes ma’aser.  If he can’t find the seller, any non-ne’eman can tell him they are me’usar and he can eat them, but only on Shabbat.  Trumat ma’aser that became mixed in, Rabi Shimon Shezuri says, even during the week we will believe the seller if he says he had already taken trumat ma’aser.
Bet: If one makes a vow that his friend will be barred from his things if the friend doesn’t eat a meal with him, and the friend doesn’t trust him by ma’asrot, the friend may eat with him the first Shabbat if he says it’s me’usar, even if the friend doesn’t trust him.  But on the second Shabbat, even though there’s an issur hanaya, the friend can only eat if he takes ma’aser.
Gimmel: Rabi Eliezer says, one does not need to take ma’aser ani from dmai.  Chachamim say, he designates some as ma’aser ani, but he doesn’t need to separate it.
Daled: One who designated trumat ma’aser of dmai or ma’aser ani of tevel will not separate it no Shabbat.  And if a kohen or a poor person would normally come to him, he can give them that, as long as he informs them that it’s actually their food.
Hay: One who says to a non-ne’eman to buy for him from a ne’eman, the non-ne’eman isn’t trusted.  If he said a certain person, we trust the messenger.  If the messenger said, I couldn’t find the person, so I bought from some other ne’eman, we don’t believe him.
Vav: One who enters a city and knows nobody there, and asks who is a ne’eman.  If the resident says, I am, we don’t believe him.  If he says a certain person is, we believe him.  If he goes to the specified person and asks, who sells dry grain, and the seller says the person who sent you, even though they seem to be in cahoots we trust them.
Zayin: Donkey drivers (who sell produce) who entered a city, one said, mine is new but my friend’s is old, but mine is me’usar and my friend’s isn’t, we don’t believe him.  Rabi Yehuda says we do.
