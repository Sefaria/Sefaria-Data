Aleph: One who was married to two women and died, the first comes before the second (in collecting her ktuba) and the heirs of the first come before the heirs of the second (if the widows died and their heirs will collect their ktubot).  If he married the first, he died, and then he married the second and he died, the second and her heirs come before the heirs of the first.
Bet: One who was married to two women and they died, and then he died, and the orphans want their mothers’ ktubot, but there is only there (enough money for) the two ktubot (and there will be no more for inheritance) they split equally (as inheritance rather than ktubot).  If there was one dinar in excess, each one takes the ktuba of their mother.  If the orphans said, we raise (the value of) our father’s property by one dinar, they do not listen to them, rather they asses the property in court.
Gimmel: If there was prospective property (i.e. inheritance from the father’s father which would now fall to the orphans) are not like possessed (property).  Rabi Shimon says, even property which has a mortgage on it, it is nothing until there is property with a mortgage (of value) more than the two ktubot by one dinar.
Daled: One who was married to three women and died, and the ktuba of one is a maneh, of one is two hundred (zuz) and of one is three hundred, and there is only a maneh, they divide equally.  If there were two hundred, the one of a maneh takes fifty and the ones of two hundred and three hundred take three gold (each gold dinar is worth twenty five regular dinarim, so they each take seventy- five).  If there were three hundred, the one of the maneh takers fifty, of two hundred takes a maneh, and of three hundred, six gold.  And so too three who put it into a fund, if (the money) decreased or increased, they split it like this.
Hay: One who was married to four women and died, the first precedes the second, the second precedes the third, and the third precedes the fourth.  The first swears to the second (that she has not already collected part of her ktuba), the second to the third, the third to the fourth, and the fourth collects without an oath.  Ben Nanas says, and so because she is the last she benefits?  Also she does not collect except with an oath.  If they all went out (divorced) on one day, all who come before her friend even one hour merit (the right to collect first).  And thus they would write (on gittin) in Yerushalayim the time.  If they were all exiting at one time, and there is only one maneh there, they split it evenly.
Vav: One who was married to two women, sold his field, and the first wrote to the buyer, I have no claim or rights with you (she gives up the right to collect her ktuba from that property), the second (wife) may take out from the buyer, the first (may take) from the second (since she precedes her) and the buyer from the first (since she has no claim against him), and they return in circles until there is a compromise between them.  So too with a creditor, and so too with a woman creditor.
