Aleph: With what may one insulate, and with what may one not insulate?  One may not insulate with peat, manure, salt, lime, sand, whether moist or dry, hay, pomace (waste from pressed grapes), soft substances, or herbs, when they are moist, but one may insulate with them when they are dry.  One may insulate with coverings, produce, dove feathers, the sawdust of carpenters, and chips of fine flax.  Rabi Yehuda forbids with fine and allows with coarse.
Bet: One may insulate with hides and one may move them, with wool shearings but one may not move them.  How does he do this (use the pot if he may not move the insulation)?  He removes the cover and they fall.  Rabi Eliezer ben Azariah says, he tilts it on its side and takes it, lest he take it and be unable to return it (to the basket where it was apparently preserved, for the wool will fill its place).  Chachamim say, he takes it out and returns it.  If he didnâ€™t cover it that day, he may not cover it when it darkens.  If he covers it and it became uncovered, he may cover it.  One may fill a jug and put it under a pillow or a mattress.
