Aleph: Partners who wanted to make a divider in the courtyard build the wall in the middle.  In a place where they had a custom to build of unhewn stones, hewn stones, half-bricks, or bricks, they build, all is according to the custom of the district.  With unhewn stones, this one gives three tfachim and that one gives three tfachim (of width to the building of the wall).  With hewn stones, this one give two and a half tfachim and that one gives two and a half tfachim.  With half-bricks, this one gives two tfachim and that one gives two tfachim.   With bricks, this one gives a tefach and a half and that one gives a tefach and a half.  Therefore, if the wall fell, the place and the stones are (property) of both of them.
Bet: And so too with a garden, in a place where they have a custom to make a fence, they obligate him (to give the space and materials for a fence), but in valleys, a place where they had a custom not to make a fence, they cannot obligate him, rather if he (the abutting owner) wants to (make a fence) he goes into his (land), builds, and makes a marker on the outside (to signify that the fence is his alone).  Therefore, if the wall fell, the space and the stones are his.  If they did it with the knowledge of both of them, they build the wall in the middle and make a marker here and there (on both sides).  Therefore, if the wall fell, the space and the stones are (property) of both of them.
Gimmel: One who (has property which) surrounds his friend from three directions, and he made a fence on the first (side), on the second, and on the third, he (the one who made the fence) cannot obligate him.  Rabi Yossi said, if he stood and made a fence on the fourth, they roll in one him all of them (for now that the one surrounded benefits from having a walled in field we obligate him to take part in the building costs).
Daled: The wall of a courtyard which fell (which divided the property of two people) they obligate him (either of the owners) to build it up to (a height of) four amot.  The presumption that he (one of the owners) gave (money to the other) until he (the other owner) brings proof that he did not bring.  From four amot and up, they do not obligate him (to contribute).  If he mad another wall close to it, even if he did not put the roof on it (for he intended to use the two walls and a roof as a hut), they roll all of it onto him (force him to pay for the building above four amot as well).  There is a presumption that he didn’t give, until he brings proof that he gave.
Hay: They force him (one owner of a joint courtyard) to build a gatehouse and a door for the courtyard.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, not all courtyards are fit for gatehouses.  They force him (one who lives in a city) to build for a city a wall, two doors, and a bolt.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, not all cities are fit for a wall.  How much (time) must he be in a city and he’ll be like the people of the city?  Twelve months.  If he bought a place to live in it, behold he is like the people of the city immediately.
Vav: One may not divide a courtyard until there will be four amot for this and four amot for that (each), and not a field until there will be in it nine kabin for this and nine kabin for that.  Rabi Yehuda says, until there will be nine half kabin for this and nine half kabin for that.  And (the may not split) a garden until there will be in it a half kav for this and a half kav for that.  Rabi Akiva says, the space of a rova (each).  And (they may) not (split) a dining hall, not a compartment, not a dovecote (place doves rest), not a garment, not a bathhouse, and not an olive press until there is in them enough for this and enough for that (to get the usage he needs).  This is the general rule, all which he can divide and its name (still applies) on it (to the part each gets, meaning it is enough to be considered a usable object), they divide, and if not, they may not divide.  When?  When they do not both want (to divide it), but when they both want (to divide it) even with less than this they may divide.  And holy writing, even if both of them want, they may not divide.
