Aleph: An ox which gored a cow and a fetus was found by her side, and it was not known if before it was gored it gave birth or it gave birth form when (after) it was gored he pays half the damage for the cow and a fourth the damage for the child.  And so too for a cow which gored an ox and her child was found next to her, and it is not known if before it gored it gave birth or from when it gored it gave birth, he pays half of the damage from the (value of) cow and a quarter of the damage from the child.
Bet: A potter who brought his pots into the courtyard of the homeowner without permission and an animal of the homeowner’s broke them, he’s patur, but if it (an animal) was damaged by it, the owner of the pots is chayav.  But if he brought them in with permission, the owner of the courtyard is chayav.  If he brought his produce into the courtyard of a homeowner without permission and an animal of the homeowner’s ate them, he’s patur, but if it was damaged by them, the owner of the produce is chayav.  But if he brought them in with permission, the owner of the courtyard is chayav.
Gimmel: If he brought his ox into the courtyard of a homeowner without permission and an ox of the homeowner gored it or a dog of the homeowner’s bit it, he’s patur.  If it gored an ox of the homeowner, he’s chayav.  If he fell into his (the homeowner’s) pit and fouled his waters, he’s chayav.  If his father or his son were in it, he pays their value.  But if he brought it in with permission, the owner of the courtyard is chayav.  Rabi says, in all of them he isn’t chayav, unless he (the homeowner) accepted upon himself to guard (the object brought in).
Daled: An ox who intended (to gore) its friend (another ox) and hit a woman and she miscarried, he (the owner) is patur from the money (due because) of the child.  And a person who intended (to hit) his friend and hit a woman and she miscarried, he pays the money of the child.  How does he pay the money of the child?  They assess the woman how much she is worth until she gives birth and how much she is worth from when she gives birth.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, if so, from when the woman gives birth, her value increases (since there is a danger the woman will die in childbirth).  Rather, they asses the children how much they are worth, and he gives to the husband.  If she doesn’t have a husband, he gives to his (the husband’s) inheritors.  If she was a maidservant and she was freed or a convert, he is patur.
Hay: One who digs a hole in a private domain and opens it into the public domain, in the public domain and opens it in a private domain, or in a private domain and opens it in another private domain, he’s chayav (if someone is damaged by it).  One who digs a hole in the public domain and an ox or donkey falls into it and dies, (the one who dug the hole is) chayav.  Whether he digs a hole, ditch, cave, trenches, or wedged ditches, he’s chayav.  If so, why does it say a hole?  Just as a hole that it has enough to kill, ten tfachim (of depth), so too anything which has enough to kill, ten tfachim (makes one chayav).  If there were less than ten tfachim and an ox or donkey fell in and died, her’s patur, but if it was damaged in it, he’s chayav.
Vav: A hole of two partners, if the first passed it and didn’t cover it and the second (passed) and didn’t cover it, the second is chayav.  If the first covered it and the second one came, found it uncovered, and didn’t cover it, the second is chayav.  If he covered it properly and an ox or donkey fell into it and died, he’s patur.  If he didn’t cover it properly and an ox or donkey fell into it and died, he’s chayav.  If it (an ox) fell forward form (fear caused by) the sound of the digging (into the pit), he’s chayav, but if it fell backwards because of the sound of the digging (outside of the pit, but died), he’s patur.  If an ox and vessels fell in and they broke or a donkey and vessels and they tore, he is chayav for the animal and patur by the vessels.  If a deaf, mentally infirm, or minor ox fell into it, he’s chayav.  A son or a daughter, a slave or a maidservant, he’s patur.
Zayin: Whether an ox or any other animal for falling into a hole, for keeping away from Mount Sinai (Hashem commanded animals be kept away from the mountain), paying kefel (if one steals, they pay back double the worth, half of which is a fine called kefel), for returning lost objects, for unloading (the commandment to help an overburdened animal), for muzzling (one may not muzzle an animal while threshing), for kilayim (one may not husband different species or plow with a mixed team), and for Shabbat (animals are also commanded to be rested on Shabbat).  And so too a wild animal, fowl, and things of that sort.  If so, why does it say an ox or a donkey?  Only that the text spoke in the present (used common cases).
