Aleph: The kohen gadol came to read.  If he wanted to read in the linen garments, he reads, and if not, he reads in a white garment of his own.  The beadle of the shul (synagogue) takes the torah scroll and gives it to the head of the shul, the head of the shul gives it to the sgan, the sgan gives it to the kohen gadol, and the kohen gadol receives standing, reads standing, and reads (the portions of), “after the death,” and, “but on the tenth.”  And he rolled the torah scroll and places it in his lap and says, more than what I read is written here.  “and on the tenth,” which is in Bamidbar he reads by heart.  And he blesses on it eight blessings, on the torah, and on the service, and on the praise, and on the forgiveness for wrong, and on the Beit Hamikdash in its own right, and on Yisra’el in its own right, and on the kohanim in their own right, and on the rest of the prayer.
Bet: One who sees the kohen gadol while he is reading does not see the bull and the goat which are burnt, and the one who sees the bull and goat which are burnt does not see the kohen gadol reading.  And not because he wasn’t allowed, but because the way was far and the work of both of them (the time the work was done) was the same.
Gimmel: If he reads in linen, he would wash his hands and his feet; undress, go down, and immerse; and come up and dry off.  They would bring him golden garments, he would put them on and wash his hands, go out and do his ram and the nation’s ram and the seven unblemished lambs which were one year old, according to Rabi Eliezer.  Rabi Akiva says, with the tamid of the morning they were offered, and the olah bull and the goat done outside they would offer with the tamid of the afternoon.
Daled: He washed his hands and feet and undressed, went down, immersed, came up, and dried off.  They brought him white garments and he put them on and washed his hands and his feet.  He went in (to the holy of holies) to get out the scoop and the pan, washed his hands and feet, went down, immersed, came up, and dried off.  They brought him gold garments and he put them on and washed his hands and feet.  He entered to offer the incense of the afternoon and fix the lights (of the menorah), washed his hands and feet, and undressed.  They brought him his clothes, and he put them on.  And they accompanied him to his house.  And he made a festival (meal) for those who he liked when he came out of the holy peacefully.
Hay: The kohen gadol serves with eight vessels (items of clothing), and a lay kohen serves with four, with the tunic, pants, turban, and girdle.  The kohen gadol added to this the breastplate, apron (ephod), robe, and frontlet (tzitz).  The urim vetumim (jeweled golden breastplate with a parchment of holy writing folded inside it) was consulted (for it could be used to consult Hashem) in these.  And they do not consult except for the king, the court, and for whom the public needed.
