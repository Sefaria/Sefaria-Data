Aleph: One who says, receive this get for my wife, or, bring this get to my wife, if he wants to retract (withdraw the giving of the get) he may retract (by getting the get back from the agent before it reaches his wife).  A woman who said, receive my get for me, if he wants to return, he may not return (for she consented, so even though it is to her detriment, the messenger acts as her).  Therefore, if the husband said to him, I don’t want you to receive for her, rather go and give it to her, if he wants to retract, he can retract.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, even one (a wife) who says, take for me my get (and deliver it, but not receive it), if he wants to retract, he cannot retract.
Bet: A woman who said, receive my get for me, needs two sets of witnesses, two (witnesses) who say, before us she said (to receive it on her behalf) and two who say, before us he accepted and tore up (the get, this is an explanation of why she does not have the get, for if she has the get, no witnesses are necessary).  Even if the first (pair) is the second, or one of the first and one of the second (both come) with one who combines with (each of) them (i.e. is part of both sets of witnesses).  An engaged young girl, she and her father accept her get.  Rabi Yehuda said, two hands (people) cannot merit as one, rather only her father accepts her get.  And all who cannot keep their own get (i.e. a minor), she cannot be divorced.
Gimmel: A minor (who is capable of keeping, and therefore receiving a get) who said, receive my get fro me, it is not a get until the get reaches her hands.  Therefore, if the husband wanted to retract, he may retract, for a minor does not make an agent.  But if her father said to him (the agent) go and receive my daughter’s get for her, if he (the husband) wanted to retract, he cannot retract.  One who says, give this get to my wife in such-and-such a place, and he gave it to her in a different place, it is invalid.  (If he said to the agent,) behold she is in such-and-such a place, if he gave it to her in a different place, it is valid.  A woman who said, receive my get for me in such-and-such a place, and he received it in another place, it is invalid, and Rabi Eliezer validates it.  (If she said) being me the get from such-and-such a place, and he brought it from another place, it is valid.
Daled: (If a woman who was married to a kohen said to an agent,) bring me my get, she eats truma until the get reaches her hands.  (If she said to the agent,) accept my get for me, she is immediately forbidden to eat truma.  Accept my get from such-and-such a place, she may eat truma until the get gets to that place, and Rabi Eliezer forbids immediately.
Hay: One who says (to two people, so they can be witnesses for the get), write a get and give it to my wife, divorce her, write a letter and give it to her, behold these should write and give (a get).  (If he said,) get rid of her, support her, do to her like the law, do to her as is fit, he didn’t say anything.  Originally they would say, one who is going out in chains and says, write a get for my wife (but does not say to give it), behold they write and give.  They returned to say, also one who goes on a sea voyage or one who goes out on a caravan.  Rabi Shimon Shezuri says, also one who is in danger (from illness).
Vav: One who was throw into a pit and said, anyone who hears my voice should write a get for my wife, behold they write and give.  A healthy person who said, write a get for my wife, he wanted to joke about her (and not give the get).  There was a case with a healthy person who said, write a get for my wife, and he went up on a roof, fell, and died.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, the Chachamim said, if he felon his own, this is  get, but if the wind blew him off, it is not a get.
Zayin: If he said to two, give a get to my wife, or to three, write a get and give it to my wife, behold they should write and give.  If he said to three, give a get to my wife, they tell other to write, because he (the husband) made them a court, according to Rabi Meir.  And this law Rabi Chanina a man of Ono brought up from prison (from Rabi Akiva, who was in prison), I have a tradition that one who says to three, give a get to my wife, that they tell others and write it, for he made them a court.  Rabi Yossi said, we said to the messenger (Rabi Chanina), we also have a tradition that even if he said to the great court in Yerushalayim, give a get to my wife, they shall learn (to write a get, for they do not tell others to carry out such functions), write, and give.  If he said to ten, write a get for my wife, one writes and two sign.  (If he said) all of you write, one writes and they all sign.  Therefore, if one of them died, behold the get is void.
