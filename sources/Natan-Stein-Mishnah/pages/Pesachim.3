Aleph: These transgress on Pesach, the Babylonian sauce (which contains breadcrumbs), the Median liquor, the Edomite vinegar, the Egyptian zitom (a type of beer), a dyer’s broth, a cook’s starch, and the paste of scribes.  Rabi Eliezer says, even women’s jewelry.  This is the general rule, anything which is from a type of grain transgress on Pesach.  Behold, these are strongly warned against, but they don’t have karet.
Bet: Dough in the cracks of a trough, if there is a kzayit in one place, he must remove it, and if not, it is nullified by its smallness, and so too in the matter of (contracting) tuma.  If he is careful about it, it impedes contact, if he wants to let it be there, it is like (a piece of) the trough.  Dough of the deaf (dough which has no fermentation), if there is something like it which has leavened, it is assur.
Gimmel: How does one separate challa if tame on Yom Tov?  Rabi Eliezer says, he doesn’t designate it until it is baked.  Rabi Yehuda ben Bteira says, put it in cold water.  Rabi Yehoshua said, this is not chametz that we are careful about by not seeing and not finding, rather he separates it and rests it until the evening, and if it leavened, it leavened.
Daled: Raban Gamliel says, three women may knead as one and may bake in an oven one after another.  Chachamim say, three women deal with the dough, one kneads, one lays out, and one bakes.  Rabi Akiva says, not all women, trees, and ovens are equal.  This is the general rule, if it rises, she wets it with cold water.
Hay: Siur (dough which is not completely leavened) must be burnt, and one who eats it is patur.  Siduk (dough which has cracks, a sign of leavening) must be burnt, and one who eats it is chayav karet.  What is siur?  (With cracks) like a locust’s horns (one on each side).  Siduk?  When its cracks mix together, according to Rabi Yehuda.  Chachamim say, in both one who eats gets karet.  And what is siur?  All whose face has become pallid like a person whose hair is standing on end.
Vav: If the fourteenth falls out on Shabbat, one removes everything before Shabbat according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, in their time.  Rabi Elazar ben Tzadok says, truma before Shabbat and chulin in its time.
Zayin: One who is going to shecht his pesach, to circumcise his son, or to eat a meal of betrothal at his father in law’s house, and he remembers he has chametz in his house, if he can return, remove, and return to his mitzva, he returns and removes.  If not, he nullifies it in his heart.  (If he can’t return because he is) saving (people) from troops, a river, bandits, fire, or debris, he nullifies in his heart.  If to establish a resting Shabbat for optional things, he returns immediately.
Chet: And so too one who left Yerushalayim and remembered that he had in his hand holy meat, if he passed Tzofim, he burns it on the spot.  If not, he returns and burns it before the birah (a place around the Beit Hamikdash) from the wood of the pile (designated for such).  For how much do they return?  Rabi Meir says, either way a kbeitza.  Rabi Yehuda says, either way a kzayit.  Chachamim say, holy meat a kzayit and chametz a kbeitza.
