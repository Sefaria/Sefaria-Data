Aleph: Beit Shamay says, all (korbanot the blood of) which are given (sprinkled) on the outer mizbe’ach, if one giving was given (they were sprinkled once), they atoned (fulfilled their purpose), but a chatat needs two (sprinklings).  Beit Hillel says, also a chatat which one giving was given it atoned, therefore, if he gave the first in the proper manner and the second (with an intention) outside of its time, it atoned, if he gave the first outside of its time and the second (with an intention) out of its place, it is pigul, and (those who eat it) are chayav karet for it.
Bet: All which are given on the inner mizbe’ach, if he missed on of the givings, he did not atone, therefore, id he gave them all properly, but one improperly, it is pasul, but there is no karet in it.
Gimmel: These are things which one is not chayav on because of pigul (they do not become pigul), the handful (taken from a meal offering), frankincense (burnt with the handful), incense (which was burned in the Beit Hamikdash every day), a mincha (meal offering) of kohanim (which they burnt), a mincha of the anointed kohen (brought every day and burnt), a mincha of (and) libation (brought with korbanot), blood (of a korban), and libations brought on their own, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, also (libations) which come with an animal (even without a mincha).  The log of oil of the metzora (brought when he recovered), Rabi Shimon says, one is not chayav on it because of pigul.  Rabi Meir says, one is chayav for pigul on it, for the blood of the asham (also brought by the metzora) allows it (to be used) and anything which has something which allows it, whether to a person (to be eaten) or to the mizbe’ach (to be burnt), one is chayav on because of pigul.
Daled: An olah (burnt offering), its blood allows its flesh for the mizbe’ach, and its skin to the kohanim.  An olah from fowl, its blood allows its flesh for the mizbe’ach.  A chatat of fowl, its blood allows its flesh for the kohanim.  Bulls that are burnt and goats that are burnt, their blood allows their portions for the mizbe’ach.  Rabi Shimon says, anything which is not on the outer mizbe’ach like a shlamim, one is not chayav on it because of pigul.
Hay: The holy things of non-Jews (which they donated to the Beit Hamikdash), one is not chayav on it for pigul, notar, or (consuming it) tame.  One who slaughters it outside it patur, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yossi makes chayav.  Things which are not chayav because of pigul, one is chayav one because of notar and one is chayav on because of (consuming while) tame, except for blood.  Rabi Shimon says, by a thing the way of which is to be eaten, but like wood, frankincense, and incense, one is not chayav on them because of (consuming them) tame.
Vav: A zevach is offered for the sake of six things, for the sake of the zevach (the purpose that particular type has), for the sake of the one offering, for the sake of Hashem, for the sake of the fire (on the mizbe’ach one which it will be cooked or burnt), for the sake of the aroma (from being offered on the mizbe’ach), and for the sake of the pleasantness (for Hashem).  A chatat and an asham, for the sake of the sin.  Rabi Yossi says, also one who didn’t have in his heart for the sake of one of these, it is valid, for it is a condition of the court, for (an issur brought by) thought does not go after (matter) other than the worker (who is offering the korban).
