Aleph: Which findings are his, and which his he obligated to announce?  These findings are his, if he found scattered produce, scattered money, bunches (of grain) in the public domain, caked of pressed figs, loaves of a baker, strings of fish, pieces of meat, shearings of wool which come from their country (are all similar and unfinished), prepared bundles of flax, and tongues of purple wool, behold these are his, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, all which has a change (marking) he is obligated to return.  How?  If he found a cake with (a shard of) pottery in it, or a loaf and there is money in it.  Rabi Shimon ben Elazar says, all merchant’s vessels he is not required to announce.
Bet: And he is requited to announce, if he found produce in a vessel or a vessel just as it is (empty), money in a pocket (pouch) or a pouch just as it is, heaps of produce, heaps of money, three coins one on top of another, bundles in a private domain, loaves of a homeowner, shearings of wool from the house of the artisan (a workshop), jugs of wine, and jugs of oil, behold these he is obligated to announce.
Gimmel: If he found young birds tied behind a stone fence, behind a fence, or on (one of the) paths in the fields, behold he may not touch them.  If he found a vessel in the garbage, if it was covered, he may not touch it, if it is uncovered, he takes and announces.  If he found it in a pile of stones or an old wall, behold these are his.  If he found on a new wall, if from halfway out (on the outer half of the wall), it’s his, if from halfway in it is (property) of the homeowner.  If he rented it (the house) to others (so it may belong to several people), even within the house, behold these are his.
Daled: If he found in a store, behold these are his.  Between the counter and the storekeeper, (the finding is property) of the storekeeper, Before a moneychanger, behold it there are his, between the chair and the moneychanger, behold these are for the moneychanger.  One who buys produce from his friend of his friend sent him produce and he found money in them, behold these are his, but if they were bound, he takes and announces.
Hay: (In the torah it says you shall return your friend’s garment and anything that he lost, but) also his garment was included in (saying) all of these (things which are lost), why was it taken out?  To make a hekesh (conclusion drawn based on textual juxtaposition) from it, to say to you, just as a garment is particular for it has signs and those who wish to claim it, so too any thing which has signs and those who wish to claim it, he is obligated to announce.
Vav: And until when is he obligated to announce?  Until its neighbors (people who live near where it was found) know about it, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, three festivals, and after the last festival seven days, such that he may go to his house three (days), return three, and announce one day.
Zayin: If he (one coming to claim the object) said the object but did not say its signs, he does not give it to him.  And a (suspected) cheater, even if he gave its signs, he does not give to him, as it says, “until your brother asks for it,” (expounded to mean) until you ask of your brother, if he is a cheater is he is not a cheater.  Anything which works and eats, will work and eat (the finder must keep, for the owner wants that one to work), but a thing which does not work but eats, he may sell (and return the money).  As it says, “and you shall return it to him,” (meaning) see hoe you return it to him (in what manner is proper).  What will happen with the money?  Rabi Tarfon says, he may use them, therefore if the got lost, he is chayav for their responsibility (for he will have to give back any money he spends).  Rabi Akiva says, he may not use them, therefore if they got lost, he is not chayav for their responsibility.
Chet: If he found books, he must read from them once every thirty days (to keep them aired out properly), and if he does not know how to read, he rolls them.  But, if he will not learn from them for the first time (he may only review to ensure he does not ware it down) and another may not read after him (for two people might tear one scroll).  If he found clothing, he shakes it out once every thirty days and spread it out for its needs (to keep it aired out), but not for his honor (to decorate his house).  (If he found) vessels of silver or vessels of copper, he uses them for their needs, but not (enough) to wear them down.  Vessels of silver or vessels of gold, he may not touch them until Eliyahu comes (for they will not become degraded).  If he found a sack or a large basket, or any thing which it is not his (normal) way to take it (handle it) behold this does not take (for he may not take care of it properly).
Tet: What is something lost?  If he found a donkey or a cow grazing on the path, this is not something lost.  A donkey and its vessels (saddle and the like) are backward, or a cow running between the vineyards (in a vineyard, where it does not usually go), behold this is something lost.  If he returned it, it fled, he returned it, and it fled, even four or five times, he is obligated to return it, as it says, “return shall you return it.”  If he lost (the value of) a sela, he (the finder) may not say to him (the owner), give me a sela (which I lost in wages from dealing with your object, rather he gives him his wages as an unemployed worker.  If there is a court there, he (the finder) makes a condition (about being repaid) before the court, but if there is no court there, before who does he make a condition?  His (work) comes first (so he doesn’t have to deal with the lost object).
Yud: If he found it in a bard, he is not obligated to (care for) it, but if he found it in the public domain, he is obligated to it.  And if it was (in) a graveyard, he does not become tame for it.  If his father said, become tame, of he said to him (about any lost object), do not return it, he does not listen to him.  If he unloaded and loaded (a donkey he sees overburdened), unloaded and loaded, even four or five times, he is obligated (to help), as it says, “help shall you help.”  If he (the donkey’s owner) went and sat, and said, since it is a mitzva upon you, if you want to unload, unload, he (the one watching) is patur, for it says, “(you shall help) with him.”  If he (the owner) was elderly or sick, he (the watcher) is chayav.  It is a mitzva from the torah to unload, but not to load (he may take wages for reloading the animal).  Rabi Shimon says, also to load.  Rabi Yossi Hagelili says, if there was on it more than it could carry, he (the watcher) does not owe him (the service of helping the donkey), for it says, “under its burden,” its burden that it can stand with it.
Yud Aleph: His lost object and the lost object of his father (and he can only deal with one at a time), his lost object comes first.  His lost object and the lost object of his rabbi, his comes first.  The lost object of his father and the lost object of his rabbi, that of his rabbi comes first, for his father brought him into this world, and the rabbi who taught him knowledge brings him to the life of the next world, but if his father is wise, that of his father comes first.  If his father and his rabbi were carrying a burden, he lets down that of his rabbi and then lets down that of his father.  If his father and his rabbi were in captivity, he redeems his rabbi and then redeems his father, but if his father was wise, he redeems his father and then redeems his rabbi.
