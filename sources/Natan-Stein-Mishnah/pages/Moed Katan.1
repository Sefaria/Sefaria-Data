Aleph: One may water an irrigated field on Chol Hamo’ed and shvi’it, whether from a spring which originally came forth (was already there) or from a spring which did not originally come forth.  But one may not water with rainwater (he might come to go collect water) or water of a deep well.  And one may not make cavities (trenches around the roots for collecting water) for vines.
Bet: Rabi Elazar ben Azarya says, one may not make a trench originally (make a new one) on Chol Hamo’ed or shvi’it.  Chachamim say, one may make a trench originally on shvi’it, and fix broken ones on Chol Hamo’ed.  They may fix the ruined (trenches of) water in the public domain and clean them out.  And they may fix the paths, roads, and mikvas, and they may do all the needs of the public, mark graves, and go out even (to check) for kilayim.
Gimmel: Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, one may draw water from tree to tree (if a lot of water collected under one tree, he may lead it to another) as long as he does not water the whole field.  Seeds that did not drink (were not watered) before the festival, he may not water them during Chol Hamo’ed, and the Chachamim allow both.
Daled: One may trap an ishut (possibly a mole) and mice from an orchard or grain field, not in its normal matter, on Chol Hamo’ed and shvi’it.  Chachamim say, in an orchard in its normal manner, and from a grain field not in its normal manner.  And one may close a breach (in a wall) on Chol Hamo’ed, and on shvi’it, he may build in the normal manner.
Hay: Rabi Meir says, they look at spots of divine sickness (tzara’at) in the beginning to be lenient (declare him clean) but not to be strict (to quarantine, for one does not grieve on Chol Hamo’ed).  Chachamim say, neither to be lenient nor strict.  And furthermore said Rabi Meir, one may gather the bones of his father or mother (after the flesh was eaten away, a person would collect the bones of his family and place them in a filial bone pit, because it is happiness for him.  Rabi Yossi says, it is mourning for him.  A person may not arouse (others to cry) for his dead, and he may not eulogize thirty days prior to a festival.
Vav: One may not dig burial chambers or graves on Chol Hamo’ed, but one may prepare (fix to the proper size and the like) burial chambers on Chol Hamo’ed.  One may make a wash-pond on Chol Hamo’ed and a coffin with a dead person in the courtyard (so people will know the woodwork is for a coffin).  Rabi Yehuda prohibits, unless there are board with him (which he simply has to assemble).
Zayin: One may marry women on Chol Hamo’ed, neither a virgin nor a widow.  And they don’t do yibum because he has joy (which cheapens the joy of Chol Hamo’ed), but he may remarry his divorced wife (he divorce for yibum).  And a woman may put on jewelry on Chol Hamo’ed.  Rabi Yehuda says, she may not be (covered in) lime (to treat her skin), for it is embarrassing for her (when it is on).
Chet: A layman may sew as usual and an artisan stitch (but not sew a group of stitches).  And he may weave the beds (weave the cords under beds to help them stay up).  Rabi Yossi says, he may even tighten (even though they are usable without tightening.
Tet: On may stand (set up) an oven, stove, or millstone on Chol Hamo’ed.  Rabi Yehuda says, one may not chisel a millstone from the beginning.
Yud: One may make a rail for a roof or a balcony, the work of a layman, not an artisan.  One may smooth cracks and flatten (a roof) with a roller, the hand, or the foot, but not with a rope-pulled roller.  A hinge, pipe, beam, lock, or key which broke, one may fix on Chol Hamo’ed, as long as he does not intend to (leave his) work for Chol Hamo’ed.  And so too pickles which (pickle fast enough such that) he can eat from on Chol Hamo’ed he may pickle.
