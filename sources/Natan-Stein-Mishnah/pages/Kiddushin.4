Aleph: Ten relations (types of lineage) came up from Bavel (in the time of Ezra to rebuild the Beit Hamikdash), kohanim, levi’im, yisra’elim, chalalim (people whose kohen forefathers married a divorcee or chalutza), gerim (converts), charurim (freedmen), mamzerim, netinim, shtukim, and asufim (the last two will be explained in the next mishna).  Kohanim, levi’im, and yisra’elim are mutar to marry each other.  Levi’im, yisra’elim, chalalim, gerim, and charurim are allowed to marry each other.  Gerim, charurim, mamzerim, netinim, shtukim, and asufim are all married to marry each other.
Bet: And which are shtukim?  Anyone who knows his mother (her lineage) and does not know his father (his lineage).  (Which are) asufim?  All who is taken from the shuk (adopted) ans sors not know is father or his mother.  Abba Shaul would call the shtukim bdukim.
Gimmel: All who are assur to come into the congregation (from marrying any of the above forms of Jews, mamzerim, netinim, shtukim, and asufim) are mutar to marry each other, and Rabi Yehuda prohibits.  Rabi Eleizer says, their certain (a mamzer and natin) with their certain is mutar, but their certain with a doubt (explained below), doubt with a certain, or doubt with a doubt is assur.  And which are the doubt?  A shatuk, asuf, and kuti.
Daled: One (a kohen) who marries a woman who is a kohenet must check (to ensure that her lineage is proper) after her four mothers (four women who make up her lineage) which are eight (for their mothers are checked as well), her mother, her mother’s mother, the mother of the father of her mother (he woman’s great grandmother) and her mother (great great grandmother), her (the woman’s) father’s mother and her mother (the woman’s great grandmother), and the mother of the father of her father (the woman’s great grandmother) and her mother.  For a levi’a and a yisra’el (to marry a kohen), they add upon he one more (generation to each woman listed).
Hay: They do not check from the mizbe’ach and up (if one of the fathers listed served as a kohen, then they do not check any lineage above him because his lineage was known to pure when he served), not from the duchan and up (a levi who sang on the platform in the Beit Hamikdash), and not from the Sanhedrin and up (even a yisra’el who was on the Sanhedrin).  And all whose forefathers were known to be public officers and organizers of charity, they marry into kehuna (marry a kohen) and do not need to be checked after.  Rabi Yossi says, also one who was signed as a witness in the record office of Yeshana of Tzippori (for the court there kept of record to make sure that only people with proper lineage would be witnesses).  Rabi Chanina ben Antigonus says, also one who was registered in the army of the king (David, for his army only included people of proper lineage).
Vav: The daughter of a male chalal is eternally pasul from the kehuna.  A yisra’el who married a chalala, his daughter is kasher to the kehuna.  A chalal who married a bat yisra’el, his daughter is pasul from the kehuna.  Rabi Yehuda says, the daughter of a male ger (convert) is like the daughter of a male chalal (pasul to the kehuna).
Zayin: Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, a yisra’el who married a giyoret (female convert), his daughter is kasher to the kehuna, and a ger who married a bat yisra’el, his daughter is kasher to the kehuna.  But, a ger who married a giyoret, his daughter is pasul to the kehuna.  Whether a ger or whether a freedman, even until ten generations, (they are pasul) until their mother is from yisra’el.  Rabi Yossi says, also a ger who married a giyoret, his daughter is kasher to the kehuna.
Chet: One who says, this son of mine is a mamzer, he is not believed.  And even if both of them (the man and the pregnant woman) say about the fetus which is in her womb, he is a mamzer, they are not believed.  Rabi Yehuda says, they are believed.
Tet: One who gave his agent the right to betroth his daughter (to a man while she is still a minor), and he (the father) went to betroth her (to a different man).  If his came first, his kiddushin is kiddushin, but if that of the agent came first, his (the agent’s) kiddushin is kiddushin.  If it is not known (who came first), they both (both of the men who were going to betroth her) give a get, and if they want, one gives a get and one marries.  And so too a woman who gave her agent the right to (accept) betrothal, and (then) she (the woman) went and betrothed herself.  If hers came first, her kiddushin is kiddushin, but if that of the agent came first, his kiddushin is kiddushin.  If it is not known, they both give her a get.  And if they want, one gives her a get and one marries.
Yud: One who he and his wife went overseas, and he comes (with) his wife and his children and says, the wife I went overseas with, behold this is she, and these are her children, he does not need to bring proof, not on the wife and not on the children.  (If he says,) she died and these are her children, he brings proof about the children, but he does not bring proof about the wife (that she was of proper lineage, for that was done before the marriage).
Yud Aleph: (If a man comes from overseas and says,) I married this woman overseas, behold this is she, and these are her children, he brings proof about the wife and does not need to bring proof about the children.  (If he says,) she died and these are her children, he must bring proof about the wife and the children.
Yud Bet: One may not be alone with two women, but one woman may be alone with two men (for a man would engage in relations in front of another woman, but not another man).  Rabi Shimon says, also one man may be alone with two women when his wife is with him, and he may sleep with them in an inn, since his wife guards him.  One may be alone with his mother or with his daughter, and he may sleep with them close by (naked), but if they have grown up (either a grown man with his mother or a man with his grown daughter), this one sleeps in her clothes and this one sleeps in his clothes.
Yud Gimmel: A man who has never married may not be a teacher, and a woman may not be a teacher (for each may come to be alone with a person of the opposite gender).  Rabi Eliezer says, also one who does not have a wife (even if he has been married before) may not be a teacher.
Yud Daled: Rabi Yehuda says, a man who has never married may not tend cattle, and two men who have never been married may not sleep in one cloak, and the Chachamim permit.  All who have (business) dealings with women may not be alone with women.  And a man may not teach his son a trade (which includes dealings) with women.  Rabi Meir says, a man must always teach his son a trade which is clean and easy and pray for the One who wealth and possessions are His, for there is no craft where there is no poverty and wealth, that there is no poverty from the trade, and no richness from the trade (meaning every trade has people who are rich and people who are poor), rather everything is according to his merit.  Rabi Shimon ben Elazar says, have you ever seen an animal or fowl which have a trade?  They are provided for without trouble, and weren’t they created to serve me?  I was created to serve my Master, so isn’t is logical that I will be provided for without trouble?  Rather I have made my actions bad and I have forfeited my sustenance.  Abba Gurin a man of Tzadin says in the name of Abba Guria, a man may not teach his son (to be a) donkey-driver, camel-driver, barber, sailor, shepherd, or storekeeper, for their craft is the craft of robbers (each tends towards inappropriate dealings).  Rabi Yehuda says in his name, donkey-drivers, most of them are wicked, camel drivers many of them are proper, sailors, most of them are pious, the best of the doctors (goes to) gehinom (hell), and the most proper of the butchers is partners with Amalek.  Rabi Nehorai says, I leave my craft in this world and I don’t teach my son other than torah, for a person eats from his salary in this world, and the principle lasts for him for the world to come, and the rest of all of the professions are not like this.  When a person comes to the hands of sickness, the hands of old age, or to the hands of troubles, and he cannot engage in his work, he dies in hunger.  But torah is not like this, rather it guards him from evil in his youth, and gives him a future and hope in his old age.  In his youth, what does he say?  “And those who wait for Hashem will renew their strength.”  In his old age what does he say?  “They shall string bring forth with age.”  And so too he says about Avraham our father, upon him may there be peace, “and Avraham was old… and Hashem blessed Avraham with everything.  We found that Avraham did all the torah, in its entirety, before it was given, as it says, “since Avraham heard My voice and kept My keepings, My commandments, My laws, and My statutes.”
