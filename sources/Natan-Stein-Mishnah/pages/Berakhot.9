Aleph: If you see a place where a miracle was done for am yisrael, you say, she’asa nissim lavoteinu bamakom haze.  A place where avoda zara was uprooted, you say, she’akar avoda zara me’artzeinu.
Bet: On weather phenomena you say, shekocho ugvurato male olam.  On land structures you say, ose ma’ase bereshit.  Rabi Yehuda says if you see the ocean, you say, she’asa et hayam hagadol, when you see if anew.  On rain and good news, hatov vehametiv.  On bad news, baruch dayan emet.
Gimmel: If you buy new things, shehechiyanu.  You bless for the state of things now.  One who asked for something that is done, it is a meaningless prayer.  Like what? Praying for the gender of a baby, or if you hear a scream praying it’s not your relations.
Daled: One who enters a city blesses twice – on the way in and out.  Ben Azay said 4, two each way.  And you give thanks for what has happened and you ask for the future.
Hay: You bless on the good and bad, as we see in shma.  Bechol levavecha means yetzer tov and ra, bechol nafshecha is even if you die, bechol me’odecha is your money.  Or, bechol me’odecha is everything hashem measures out for you.  One should not act lightly about the Beit Hamikdash.  You don’t go on har habayit with your everyday items, you don’t use it as a shortcut, and you don’t spit while on it.  In the mikdash, they would add min ha’olam to the end of every bracha.  When the heretics used this to say there is only one world, they replaced it with min ha’olam ve’ad ha’olam.  And they established that people would greet each other with shem hashem, as seen in various psukim.  There’s a pasuk, et la’asot l’hashem heferu toratecha.  Rabi Natan says, when the torah is being suspended, it is a time to do for hashem.
