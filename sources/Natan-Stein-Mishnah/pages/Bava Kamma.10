Aleph: One who steals and feeds his children of he put it down before them, they are exempt from paying.  And if it was a thing in which there was a mortgage (land) they are chayav to pay.  We do not change money from the till of customs takers, the pocket of (tax) collectors (for we assume it to be improperly taken) and we do not take charity from them.  But, he may take from (money he keeps in) his house or in the shuk (for his personal money is not necessarily stolen).
Bet: If tax customs collectors took his donkey and gave him a different donkey or bandits stole his clothes and gave him different clothes, behold they are his, since the owners gave up hope for (someone returning) them.  One who saves (something) from the river, from troops, or from bandits, if the owners gave up hope, behold they are his.  And so too a swarm of bees, if the owners gave up hope (of getting the bees back), behold they are his.  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka said, a woman or minor is believed to say, this swarm came out from here (and therefore this is the owner).  And he may walk inside the field of his friend to save his swarm.  If he damaged, he pays what he damaged, but he may not cut his branch (do any intentional damage) on condition that he will give him money.  Rabi Yishma’el the son of Rabi Yochanan ben Broka said, he may even cut and give the money.
Gimmel: One who recognizes his vessels and books in the hand of another, and report of theft went out in the city (was known), the buyer (one who now has the items) will swear to him how much he paid, and he will take (that amount and return the items).  And if not (the theft was not known in the city), we do not give him the power, for I can say he (the one claiming them) sold them to another and this one (who is now in possession) bought them from him.
Daled: If one comes with his barrel of wine and one comes with his jug of honey, the barrel of honey cracked, and that one pours out his wine and saves the honey in it (his barrel), that one (the one who came with wine) only has his wage (rent for the barrel and salary for his actions, but not money for the wine).  But if he said, I will save yours (the honey) if you give me the money of mine, he is chayav to give it to him.  If a river swept away his donkey and the donkey of his friend, if his is worth a mane and his friend’s is worth two hundred, and if he left his and saved that of his friend, he only has his salary.  But if he said to him, I will save yours if you give me the (the worth) of mine, he is chayav to give him.
Hay: One who steals a field from his friend, and violent people took it, if it is a blow on the area (including surrounding fields), he says to him, behold your field is before you.  But if it is a result of the thief, he is chayav to stand for him another field (in its place).  If a river flooded it, he says to him, behold your field is before you.
Vav: One who steals (from) his friend, borrowed from him, or took a deposit from him in a settled area, he may not return to him in the desert (where the thing has a better chance of being ruined).  (If he stipulates) on condition to go out to the desert, he may return to him in the desert.
Zayin: One who says to his friend, I stole from you, you lent me, or you deposited with me, and I do not know if I returned to you or I didn’t return to you, he is chayav to pay.  But, if he said to him, I do not know if I stole from you, if you lent me, or if you deposited with me, he is patur from paying.
Chet: One who steals a lamb from the flock, returned it, and it (later) died or was stolen, he is chayav for its responsibility.  If the owners did not know about its theft or its returning, and they counted the flock and it was full, he’s patur from paying (if it died or was stolen afterwards).
Tet: One does not buy from shepherds wool, milk, or kids, and not from watchmen of fruit fruit or wood (for we fear these are all stolen).  But, one buys from a woman wool clothing in Yehuda, linen clothes in the Galil, and calves in Sharon (for these are the common products of the area).  And all who say (to the buyer) to hide (what they buy) it is assur (to buy from them).  And one may buy chickens and eggs from any place.
Yud: Hackled wool which the washer takes out (stray strands which come out while preparing the wool) behold they are his, but (the threads) which the comber (of the wool takes out) behold they are of the homeowner.  The washer takes three threads and they are his, more than that, they are of the homeowner.  If they were black (threads) on white (clothes) the washer takes them all and they are his (for they make the garment worse).  A tailor who had leftover thread and there is enough to sew with it or (to sew) a patch which is three (fingers) by three, behold these are of the homeowner.  What the carpenter takes off with a plane, behold they are his, but with a hatchet, (they are) of the homeowner.  And if he did it by the homeowner in his domain), even the sawdust is of the homeowner.
