Aleph: The court and all of Yisra’el saw it (the new moon), the witnesses were examined, and they didn’t manage to say, it is sanctified, before it got dark, it is added (a day to the month).  If only the court saw it, two would stand before them and say, it is sanctified, it is sanctified.  If three saw it and they are a court, two will stand and they will seat (two) from their friends with the one and they will testify before them and they will say, it is sanctified, it is sanctified.  For one person is not trusted by himself.
Bet: All shofarot are valid except that of a cow, since it is (called) a keren (horn).  Rabi Yossi said, and aren’t all shofarot called keren?  As it says, “when you elongate (a sound) with the yovel keren” (referring to a shofar).
Gimmel: The shofar of Rosh Hashana is of an ibex, straight, its mouth is covered in gold, and there are two trumpets to its side.  The shofar elongates (the sound) and the trumpets shorten for the mitzva of the day is with shofarot.
Daled: On a fast (the shofar is) of rams, bent, its mouth is covered in silver, and there are two trumpets in the middle.  The shofar shortens and the trumpets elongate, for the mitzva of the day is with the trumpets.
Hay: Yovel is equal to Rosh Hashana in blasts and blessings (shofar is blown on Yom Hakippurim in yovel).  Rabi Yehuda says, on Rosh Hashana they blow with those of rams, and on yovel with those of ibex.
Vav: A shofar which cracked and he glued it is invalid.  If he glued together fragments of shofarot, it’s pasul.  If it had a hole and he plugged it, if it hinders the sound, it’s invalid, and if not, it’s valid.
Zayin: One who blows in a pit, cellar, or barrel, if he heard the sound of the shofar, he’s yotze, and if he heard the sound of an echo, he is not yotze.  And so too one who was passing behind a shul or his house was close to a shul and he heard the sound of shofar or of megilla, if he directed his heart (had the proper intention), he is yotze, and if not, he is not yotze.  Even though this one heard and that one heard, this one had the proper intention and this one did not have the proper intention.
Chet: “And it was when Moshe would life his hands and Yisra’el would prevail etc.”  And do the hands of Moshe make a war or break a war?  Rather to tell you, all times which Yisra’el would look up and subject their hearts to their Father in the sky they would prevail, and if not, they would fall.  Similarly you can say, “make for yourself a serpent and put it on a pole, and it will be that all the bitten will see it and live.”  And does a snake kill or does a snake resurrect?  Rather to tell you, all times which Yisra’el would look up and subject their hearts to their Father in the sky they would be healed, and if not, they would perish.  A deaf person, a mentally infirm person, and a minor do not fulfill the obligation of the many.  This is the general rule, all who aren’t obligated in the thing does not fulfill the obligation of the many.
