Aleph: Rabi Eliezer says, if he didn’t bring a vessel (the knife for a brit mila) on erev Shabbat, one may bring it on Shabbat uncovered.  If it a time of danger, he may bring the knife based on witnesses (who will testify that he brought only the knife).  And another thing said Rabi Eliezer, one may chop wood to make charcoal and to make an iron vessel (knife, if they don’t have one).  Rabi Akiva said a general rule, any melacha you can do from erev Shabbat (like preparing the knife) does not push off Shabbat, but any melacha which one cannot do from erev Shabbat (like the brit itself) pushes off Shabbat.
Bet: One may fulfill the needs of mila on Shabbat, one may circumcise, tear, suck, and put on a bandage and cumin.  If he didn’t grind (the cumin) from erev Shabbat, he chews with his teeth and puts.  If he did not mix the wine and oil (to put on the wound), he puts on each by itself.  From the outset, one may not make a robe for it, but he may wrap it with a rag.  If he didn’t prepare if from erev Shabbat, he wraps (a rag) on his finger and brings it (on the wound), and (he may bring one) even from another courtyard.
Gimmel: One may wash the baby, whether before or after the brit mila, they (wash him by) sprinkling on him with their hand, but not a vessel.  Rabi Elazar ben Azariah says, one may wash a baby on the third day (after the brit mila) if it falls out on Shabbat, as it says, “and it was on the third day when they were in pain.”  If there is a doubt about whether there is a brit mila (based either on a doubt in the length of the pregnancy or the actual day the baby was born) and an androgynous, one does not violate Shabbat for him, and Rabi Yehuda allows for an androgynous.
Daled: One who had two babies, one to have a brit mila after Shabbat and one to have on Shabbat, and he forgot and circumcised the one for after Shabbat on Shabbat, he’s chayav.  If he had one to circumcise on erev Shabbat and one on Shabbat, and he forgot and circumcised the one for erev Shabbat on Shabbat, Rabi Eliezer says he’s chayav, and Rabi Yehuda says he’s patur.
Hay: A baby may have a brit on the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, or twelfth day, no more and no less.  How is this?  Normally, the eighth; if he was born at twilight, the ninth; twilight before Friday, the tenth; Yom Tov which fell after Shabbat (and the baby was born twilight before Friday), the eleventh; and Rosh Hashana (after Shabbat) the twelfth.  And a baby who is sick, we do not give him a brit mila until he becomes healthy.
Vav: These are shreds (of foreskin) which hinder (the validity) of a brit mila, those which the flesh covers most of the corona (the head of the penis).  (If he still has this) he may not eat truma.  And if he is fat, he corrects it (removes more than the foreskin, for the leftover still seems to cover the penis) for the sake of a proper appearance (so we don’t think he was improperly circumcised).  If he circumcised but didn’t tear the circumcision, it is as if he didn’t circumcise.
