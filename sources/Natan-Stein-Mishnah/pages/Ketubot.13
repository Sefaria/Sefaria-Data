Aleph: There were two judges of decrees in Yerushalayim, Admon and Chanan ben Avishalom.  Chanan says two things and Admon says seven (things which are disputed).  One who went overseas and his wife claims maintenance, Chanan says, she swears in the end (when she claims her ktuba) and she does not swear in the beginning (when she claims maintenance).  The sons of the kohanim gedolim disagree with him, and said, she swears in the beginning and the end.  Rabi Dosa Ben Harkinas said like their words.  Raban Yochanan ben Zakai said, Chanan said well, she does not swear except at the end.
Bet: One who went overseas, and one stood up (voluntarily) and supported his wife, Chanan says, he lost his money.  The sons of the kohanim gedolim disagreed with him and said, he swears how much he spent and takes it.  Rabi Dosa Ben Harkinas said like their words.  Raban Yochanan ben Zakai said, Chanan said well, he rested his money on the horn of a deer (meaning he placed it on something hard to catch back and therefore renounced it).
Gimmel: Admon says seven, one who died and left sons and daughters, when the property is great, the sons inherit and the daughters are maintained, when the property is little, the daughters are maintained and the sons frequent the openings (beg).  Admon says, because I am a male I lost?  Raban Gamliel says, I see the words (agree with the opinion) of Admon.
Daled: One who claims from his friends jugs of oil, and he admitted jars, Admon says, since he admitted to part of the claim, he must swear, and the Chachamim say, this is not an admission of the type of the claim.  Raban Gamliel says, I see the words of Admon.
Hay: One who stipulated (to give) money to his son-in-law, and he extended his leg (went bankrupt) she must sit (in her father’s house) until her hair gets white (if the groom does not agree to marry her without the dowry).  Admon says, she could say, if I stipulated upon myself, I would sit until my hair turns white, but now that my father stipulated for me, what should I do?  Either marry or divorce.  Raban Gamliel says, I see the words of Admon.
Vav: One who contests (the ownership of) a field, and he (the one making the claim) signed it (the bill of sale) as a witness (but claims that the field was stolen from him by the seller to the current resident of the field), he (the one who is claiming the field was originally his) may say, the second (who he is claiming from) is comfortable for me, and the first (who allegedly stole the field) is harder than him (so I am dealing with the current resident), and the Chachamim say, he lost his right.  If he made a sign (boundaries) for another (adjacent field which he sold, excluding the field he is currently claiming) he lost his right.
Zayin: One who went overseas and the path of his field (through other people’s fields) was lost, Admon says, he may go the shortest one (way he can find to cut through their fields even without permission), and the Chachamim say, he can buy a path for a hundred maneh, or let him fly in the air (the neighbors have a right to deny him passage).
Chet: One who brings out a bill of debt on his friend and the other one brings out (a bill stating that) he (the borrower) sold him (the lender) the field, Admon says, he can say, if I were in debt to you, you should have collected what is yours when you sold me the field (not pay but agree that my debt is forgiven).  Chachamim say, this one was prudent that he sold him the land, because he can take it as a pledge (the lender can now take the field back and for sure has the money).
Tet: Two who brought out bills of debt on each other, Admon says, (one can say) if I owed you, why did you borrow from me?  Chachamim say, each one collects his bill of debt.
Yud: There are three lands (regarding the topic of) marriage, Yehuda, Transjordan, and the Galil.  (A husband) may not compel (his wife) to move from town to town (which are in different lands) or from city to city, but in the same land (the husband may) move from town to town or city to city, but not from town to city or city to town.  He may take out from a bad dwelling to a good dwelling, but not from a good dwelling to a bad dwelling.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, not even from a bad dwelling to a good dwelling, for a good dwelling tests (the health, for she has to keep up the house).
Yud Aleph: All can bring (their family forcefully) to the land of Israel, but none may (force to) leave.  All may bring to Yerushalayim, but none may leave.  (Allowing to force their family applies) to men and women.  If he married a woman in Israel and divorced her in Israel, he gives her (for her ktuba) the money (currency) of Israel.  If he married a woman in Israel and divorced her in Cappadocia (a place, where the currency was worth more), he gives her the money of Israel.  If he married a woman in Cappadocia and divorced her in Israel, he gives her the money of Israel.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, he gives her from the money of Cappadocia.  If he married a woman in Cappadocia and divorced her in Cappadocia, he gives her the money of Cappadocia.
