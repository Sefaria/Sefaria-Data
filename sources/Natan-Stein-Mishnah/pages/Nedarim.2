Aleph: And these are untying (unbinding) chulin that I shall eat of yours (your food shall be like chulin), like pork, like avoda zara, like perforated skins (of animals, which was involved in some practices of avoda zara), like nevelot, like trefot, like skatzim, like remasim, like Aaron’s challa (separated challa given to the kohanim), or like his (the kohanim’s) truma, it’s unbound (for these items are forbidden from the torah, which a person cannot make assur).  One who says to his wife, behold you are to me like my mother (whom I cannot have sex with) they open him an opening from another place (find him a loophole with some other wording), so that things as such (prohibiting his wife from sex) will not be treated with levity.  (If a person says) konam that I don’t sleep, that I don’t speak, that I don’t walk, and one who says to his wife, konam that I do not have sex with you, behold this is (bound by the pasuk), “and he shall not violate his word.”  An oath that he doesn’t sleep, that he doesn’t speak, that he doesn’t walk, he’s assur.
Bet: (If one says) korban I won’t eat of yours (based on the wording it does not affect what he does eat), korban I will eat of yours (which may be taken as an oath by the life of the korban), not a korban I won’t eat of yours (again, this does not affect what he eats), he’s mutar.  An oath that I won’t eat of yours, an oath that I will eat of yours (meaning in context let there be an oath upon me if I eat of yours), and not an oath that I won’t eat of yours (seen as a double negative), he’s assur.  This is a stringency in oaths (the latter cases) over vows (the prior cases).  And a stringency in vows over oaths how?  If he said, konam the sukka I am making (I will not do the mitzva of sukka), the lulav I am taking, the tfillin I am laying, in vows he is assur and in oaths he is mutar, for one may not take an oath to transgress a mitzva.
Gimmel: There is a vow in a vow, and there is no oath in an oath.  How?  If he said, behold I am a nazir if I eat, behold I am a nazir if I eat, and he ate, he is chayav on each one.  An oath that I will not eat, and oath that I will not eat, and he ate, he is only chayav one.
Daled: Unspecified vows are made stringent, and their explanation (if they are explained by the taker, their interpretation) is lenient.  How?  If he said, behold this is on me like salted meat, (or) like libation wine, if (he specified afterwards that) he vowed of heaven, it’s assur, if he vowed of avoda zara, mutar, and if unspecified assur.  Behold it is on me like cherem, if like cherem of heaven, assur, if like cherem of the kohanim (for this is generally used only for property already belonging to kohanim), patur, and if unspecified, assur.  Behold it is on me like ma’aser, if he vowed like ma’aser behema, assur, if of the threshing floor, mutar (for it is already permitted), and if unspecified, assur.  Behold it is on me like truma, if he vowed like truma of the chamber (money for the beit Hamikdash), assur, if like that of the threshing floor, mutar (for that is prohibited, and he cannot make his food prohibited like truma), if unspecified, assur, according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, unspecified truma in Yehuda is assur, in the Galil, mutar, for the people of the Galil do not know of the truma of the chamber.  Unspecified charamim, in Yehuda are mutar and in the Galil assur, for the people of the Galil for not know of the cherem of the kohanim.
Hay: If he vowed with cherem and he said, I didn’t vow except with the net (cherem) of the sea; with korban and he said, I didn’t vow except with the offerings (korbanot) of the kings; behold my bones are korban (saying his friend could not benefit from him), and he says, I didn’t swear except with the bone I set aside to swear with it (he intended to make a misleading vow); and, konam my wife benefits from me, and he says I didn’t vow except with my first wife who I divorced, on all of these they do not ask them (to explain themselves).  And if they asked, they punish them and are stringent with them according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, they open them an opening (loophole) from somewhere else, and teach them so that they should not act with levity regarding vows.
