Aleph: One who receives a field from his friend (as a sharecropper who pays a part of the harvest), in a place where it was the custom to harvest, he harvest, to uproot (crops by hand) he uproots, to plow after (harvesting so weeds will die) he plows, all is according to the custom of the country.  Just as they divide the produce they divide the hay and stra, just as they divide the wine, they divide the prunings and the reeds (used as trellises), and both of them supply the reeds.
Bet: On who receives a field from his friend and it is an irrigated field or a field with trees, if the spring dried up or the trees were cut down, he may not deduct from his rent.  If he said, lease me this irrigated field or this field with trees, if the spring dried up or the trees were cut down, he reduces from his rent.
Gimmel: One who receives a field from his friend and let it lie fallow, they assess it how much it is fit to make and he (the renter) gives him (the owner), for so he writes to him (in the agreement) if I let it lie fallow and do not work it, I will pay based on the best (yield the field is fit to make).
Daled: One who receives a field from his friend and did not want to weed, and said to him (the owner) what does it matter to you, since I am giving you your rent.  They do not listen to him, since he (the owner) can say to him, tomorrow (some day) you will go out from me (give me back the field) and it will raise before me grasses (weeds).
Hay: One who receives a field from his friend and it did not make (produce, so the renter feels it is not worth the trouble), if there was enough to stand (make) a pile of grain, he is chayav to care for it (so he can pay the owner).  Rabi Yehuda says, what is the amount of a pile of grain?  Only if there is in it enough to drop (the amount used to sow the field).
Vav: One who receives a field from his friend and locusts ate it or it was blasted (by wind ruining the grain), if it is a blow on the district, he deducts from the rent, if it is not a blow on the district, he does not deduct from the rent (for he can say it was the luck of the renter).  Rabi Yehuda says, if he received it from him for money (rented as opposed to tenant or sharecropping) either way he does not deduct from the rent.
Zayin: One who receives a field from his friend for ten kor of wheat a year, if it was blighted, he may give from in it (for the ten kor), and if the wheat was good, he may not say to him, behold I will buy from the shuk, rather he gives him from it.
Chet: One who receives a field from his friend to sow barley may not sow it (with) wheat (for it takes more from the soil), (if he got it for) wheat he may sow it barley.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel forbids (even the second case).  (If he got it for) legumes, he may not sow it (with) grain, for grain, he may not sow it legumes.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel forbids.
Tet: One who receives a field from his friend for a few years may not sow it with flax (which takes a lot of nutrients and its roots last for seven years) and he does not have the beams of the sycamore (if there were sycamores, he may not take branches from them, for they take seven years to grow back).  If he received it from him for seven years, in the first year he may sow flax and he has the beams of sycamores.
Yud: One who receives a field from his friend for one week (seven years) for seven hundred zuz, the shvi’it (which falls during these years) is part of the count.  If he received it from him for seven years for seven hundred zuz, shvi’it is not part of the count.
Yud Aleph: One hired for (work during) the day collects (his wage) the whole night (if after that, the hirer is transgression on the prohibition of withholding wages).  One hired for the night collects the whole day.  One hired by collects all the (following) night and all the day.  One who is hired for a Shabbat (seven days), hired for a month, hired for a year, or hired for a week (seven years), if he went out (finished work) during the day, he collects the whole day, if he went out during the night, he collects the whole night and the whole day.
Yud Bet: Whether he hired a person, rented an animal, or rented vessels, he has (a responsibility) because (of the commandment) of, “in its day you shall give his wage.”  And he had because of, “you shall not let rest the work of a rented (entity) with you until the morning.”  When?  When he (the hired) claimed it from him.  If he didn’t claim it, he does not transgress on it.  If he ordered it (an equivalent of the wage) by a shopkeeper or by a moneychanger, he does not transgress upon it.  A hired worker, in his time he swears (he was not paid) and takes, if his time passed, he does not swear and take.  If there are witnesses that he (the hired) claimed it, behold this one swears and takes (even after his time has passed).  A resident alien has (transgression) because of, “in its day you shall give his wage,” but he does not have because of, “you shall not let rest the work of a rented (entity) with you until morning.”
Yud Gimmel: One who lends his friend may not take collateral from him except in court, and he may not enter his house to take his collateral, as it says, “outside you shall stand (and the borrower will bring out the pledge).”  If he (the borrower) had two vessels (sets of clothes) he takes on and leaves one, and he returns the pillow (which is used as collateral by one who only has one pillow) at night and the plow during the day.  But if he (the borrower) dies, he (the lender) does not return to his heirs (unless they pay back the loan).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, even to him he does not return except until thirty days, and from thirty days on he sells tem in court (to pay back the debt).  A widow, whether she is poor or rich, one may not take collateral from her, as it says, “and you may not make collateral the clothes of a widow.”  One who takes collateral from millstones transgresses a lo ta’ase (negative commandment) and is chayav for two vessels (the two millstones), as it says, “one may not make collateral from millstones or the upper millstone.”  Not millstones and the upper millstone alone did they say, rather anything with which he makes food for people, as it says, “because he makes a collateral of the man’s life.”
