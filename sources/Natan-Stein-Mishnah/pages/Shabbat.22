Aleph: A barrel which broke, one may save from it food for three meals.  And he may tell others, come and save for yourselves, as long as (none of them) use a sponge (to collect the wine and then squeeze it out later).  One may not squeeze fruits to get their juice out, and if they came out on their own, they are assur.  Rabi Yehuda says, if they were for food what comes out of them is mutar, if it was for a drink, what comes out of them is assur.  Honeycombs which one crushed before Shabbat, and (the honey) came out by itself, it’s assur, and Rabi Elazar allows it.
Bet: Whatever comes in hot water (was boiled) from before Shabbat, one may soak in hot water on Shabbat, and whatever didn’t come in hot water before Shabbat, one may rinse it in hot water on Shabbat, except for an old salty fish, small salted fish, and Spanish kolyas (a type of fish), for this rinsing is finishing their work (of prepare to eat).
Gimmel: One may break a barrel to eat from it dried figs, as long as he doesn’t intend to make a vessel.  One may not make a hole in the bung (stopper) of a barrel, according to Rabi Yehuda, and Chachamim allow.  And he may not make a hole in its side, and if it had a hole, he may not put wax on it, since he is spreading.  Rabi Yehuda said, a case came before Raban Yochanan ben Zakai in Arabia and he said, I fear for him a chatat.
Daled: One may put a cooked dish in a pit to preserve it, good water in bad such that it will become colder, and cold water in the sun so that it will heat up.  One whose vessels (garments) got soaked in water on the way, he may walk in them and not worry.  When he reaches the outer courtyard (of a city, which is guarded and he could leave his clothes to dry), he spreads them in the sun, but not opposite the people (they might think he washed clothes on Shabbat).
Hay: One who bathes in cave water and in water from Tveria (both referring to warm waters) and he wipes, even with ten towels, he won’t take them in his hand (home, for he might come to wring them out), but ten people wipe with one towel their face, hands, and feet, and they may take it in their hand.
Vav: One may anoint or rub on the stomach, but one may not knead (rub vigorously) or scrape (with a brush).  One may not go down to Kordima (a river with a slippery base, so we are afraid his clothes will become wet and he will wring them), use ipecac, one may not manipulate (the spinal alignment) of a child, and one may not set a break.  One whose hand and foot were dislocated, he may not heal them with cold water, but he may wash as usual, and if it healed, it healed.
