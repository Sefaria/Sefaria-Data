Aleph: A hotplate which one heated with straw or straw remainders taken from the field, one may put a dish of food on it.  (If he heated) with peat and sticks, he may not put on it until he rakes or until he puts ashes on it.  Beit Shamay says, hot (water may be put on), but not food, and Beit Hillel says, water and food.  Beit Shamay says, one may remove, but not return, and Beit Hillel says, he may even return.
Bet: An oven which one heated with straw or straw remainders one may not put in it or in it.  A half-sized hotplate (which maintains heat better) which one heated with straw or straw remainders, it is like a hot plate, with peat or wood, it is like an oven.
Gimmel: One may not put an egg next to a hot pot so that it will roll, he may not crack it in a scarf (which has been heated by the sun), and Rabi Yossi allows.  And he may not bury it in sand and the dirt of roads so that it will be roasted.
Daled: Once the people of Tveria brought a pipe of cold (water) into a channel of hot (water, to heat it up).  Chachamim said to them, if it’s on Shabbat, it is like how water which was heated on Shabbat, which are assur for washing and drinking.  If on Yom Tov, they are like hot water which was heated up on Yom Tov, assur for washing and mutar for drinking.  A raked water hotpot may be drunk from on Shabbat.  A water heater (with coals under a vessel for heating) even if raked it may not be drunk from.
Hay: A hot pot which was removed (from the flame), one may not put into it cold water such that they will get warmer, but he may put it into a cup (with cold water) to make it lukewarm.  The stewpot and cauldron that he removed while boiling, he may not put spices in them, but he may put it into a bowl or a serving dish.  Rabi Yehuda says, he may put it into anything unless there is in it vinegar or brine.
Vav: One may not put a vessel under the candle to collect from it the oil, but if he put it there during the day it’s mutar.  One may not derive benefit from it, since it is not prepared (for use on Shabbat).  One may move a new candle (never used to light for Shabbat) but not an old one.  Rabi Shimon says, any candle may be moved, except for the one he is lighting that Shabbat.  One may put a vessel under the candle to collect its sparks, but he may not put water in it, since that is extinguishing.
