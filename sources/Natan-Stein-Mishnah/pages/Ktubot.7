Aleph: One who makes a vow (against) his wife benefiting from him (or his property) if it is under thirty days, he establishes a guardian, more than this (if she does not agree to have the guardian) he exits (the marriage) and gives her her ktuba.  Rabi Yehuda says, by a (woman married to a) yisra’el, one month he stays (and established a guardian and may remain married) but two (months, meaning any more than one month) he exits and gives her ktuba, and by a kohenet, with two he may stay (because he may not remarry her after he divorces her, so we give him extra time to find a way out), and the third, he exits and gives her ktuba.
Bet: One who vows (that) his wife will not taste one of all the types of produce will exit and give her ktuba.  Rabi Yehuda says, by a yisra’el, one day he stays, two he exits and gives her ktuba, and by a kohenet, two (days) he stays, three he exits and gives her ktuba.
Gimmel: One who vows his wife will not make (herself) up with one of all the kinds (of make-up) will exit and give her ktuba.  Rabi Yossi says in poor women, (he exits when) he did not give a time limit, in rich women, (if the vow is still effective after) thirty days.
Daled: One who vows his wife will not go to her father’s house, when he is with her in the city (and she visits often), one month he stays, two he exits and gives her ktuba.  And when he (the father) is (living) in another city, one festival he stays, three, he exits and gives her ktuba.
Hay: One who vows his wife will not go to a house of mourning or a wedding, he exits and gives her ktuba, because he closes before her (for since she does not console or rejoice with others, they will not come to her).  And if he claimed, it is for a different reason, he has the right.  If he said to her (I will annul the vow) if you say to so-and-so what you told me or what I told you (either of which may be degrading) or you fill (a vessel with water) and pour on the trash (to appear foolish), he exits and gives her ktuba.
Vav: And these exit without their ktuba, one who transgresses the law of Moshe or a Jewish woman.  What is the law of Moshe?  She feeds him what is not me’usar, she sleeps with him while a nidda, she does not separate challa for him, and she swears but does not fulfill.  And what is the law of a Jewish woman?  She goes out with her head bare, she spins in the shuk (behaves inappropriately while doing business), and speaks with everyone.  Abba Shaul says, also one who curses his parents to his face.  Rabi Tarfon says, also a loudmouth.  What is a loudmouth?  When she speaks in her house and her neighbors hear her voice.
Zayin: One who betroths a woman on the condition that there are no vows (of hers that he allows to be binding) on her, and it is found that she has vows on her, she is not betrothed.  If he married her simply (without any further condition) and vows were found on her, she exits without her ktuba.  (If he betroths her) on condition that she has no blemishes, and blemishes were found on her, she is not betrothed.  If he married her simply and blemishes were found on her, she exits without her ktuba.  All blemishes which invalidate by kohanim invalidate by women.
Chet: If there were blemishes on her and she was still in her father’s house, the father needs to prove that these blemishes came about after she was betrothed, and it is (as if) his field was flooded (it was his bad luck).  If she entered the domain of the husband, the husband must prove that before she was betrothed she had these blemishes, and his acquiring (her) was a mistaken acquisition, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, what is this talking about?  In blemishes which are hidden, but with exposed blemishes, he cannot claim (that he was mistaken in taking her).  And if there is a bathhouse in that city, even hidden blemishes he cannot claim about, for he may check her through her relatives (before taking her).
Tet: A man (upon) whom blemishes came about (and the wife wants a get), they do not force him to exit.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, what is this talking about?  In small blemishes, but in large blemishes, they force him to exits (if she wants to).
Yud: And these we force to exit, one afflicted with leprosy, one with a certain disgusting nasal growth, one who collects dog excrement (for tanning hides), one who mines copper (whose skin is affected), and a tanner (for he smells), whether they had it before they married or the came about after they married.  And about all of them Rabbi Meir said, even if he stipulated with her (that she could accept these) she can say, I thought I could accept (these defects) but now I can’t accept.  Chachamim say, (when he had them before marriage) she must accept (even) against her (current) will except one who is afflicted with leprosy, for she weakens him (sexual relations are bad for him, and therefore we do not let her stay married to him).  There was a case in Tzidon with a tanner who died and he had a brother who was a tanner, the Chachamim said, she (the wife) may say (to the brother who needs to do yibum or chalitza for her), I could accept your brother, but you I cannot accept (and therefore he must do yibum).
