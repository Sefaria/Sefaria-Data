Aleph: All are chayav to see (the Beit Hamikdash on the festivals) except for, a deaf-dumb, a mentally infirm person, a minor, one of undetermined gender, an androgynous, women, unfreed slaves, the lame, the blind, the sick, the old, and one who cannot go up on his feet.  Who is a minor?  All who cannot ride on their father’s shoulders and go up from Yerushalayim to the temple mount according to Beit Shamay.  And Beit Hillel says, all who cannot hold their father’s hand and go up from Yerushalayim to the temple mount, as it says, “three festivals,” (and the word used for festivals is feet, showing one goes up on his own feet.
Bet: Beit Shamay says, the re’iya (a korban for seeing the Beit Hamikdash on the festivals) is (has a value of) two silver, and the chagiga (the festival korban) is a ma’ah (a sixth of a dinar) of silver.  Beit Hillel says, the re’iya is a ma’ah of silver, and the chagiga is two silver.
Gimmel: Olot on festivals come from (are bought with only) chulin (funds), and shlamim (may be bought from) ma’aser (sheni money).  On the first of Yom Tov of Pesach, Beit Shamay says, (the shlamim chagiga korban is paid for) from chulin.  And Beit Hillel says, from ma’aser.
Daled: Yisra’elim fulfill their obligation (to bring shlamei simcha) with vowed, donated, and animal ma’aser, and kohanim (fulfill) with chata’ot, ashamot, and with the bechor, the breast, and the shoulder (which are given to the kohanim), but not with birds or menachot.
Hay: One who has many eaters and little property brings many shlamim (which are eaten) and few olot (which are not eaten).  (If one has) a lot of property and few eaters, he brings many olot and few shlamim.  If he has little of both, on this it was said, a ma’ah silver and two silver (as the values of what he brings).  If he has a lot of both, on this it was said, “a person, like the gift of his hand according to the blessing of Hashem which He has given him.”
Vav: One who didn’t celebrate (through a korban) on the first Yom Tov, (may) offer the whole festival, and on the last of Yom Tov (Shmini Atzeret) he may offer.  If the festival passed and he didn’t offer, he is not chayav to compensate.  On this it was said, “what is bent cannot be straightened, and what is missing cannot be counted full.”
Zayin: Rabi Shimon ben Menasya days, what is something net which cannot be straightened?  This is one who has inappropriate relations and a mamzer is born from him.  If you say it is by a thief when he steals, he may return it and straighten things out.  Rabi Shimon ben Yochay says, We do not call something bent unless it was straight originally and was bent, and what is it?  This is a scholar who separates from torah.
Chet: Annulment of vows floats in the air and has nothing (no textual source) to support it.  The laws of Shabbat, chagiga (korbanot), and me’ila (misappropriation of holy objects) behold they are like hills hanging by a hair, for they have little text (which supports them) and many laws.  Legal matters, temple services, teharot and tumot, and inappropriate relations have what (texts) to support them.  These (all of the laws mentioned here) are the body (essentials) of torah.
