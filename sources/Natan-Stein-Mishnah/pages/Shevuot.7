Aleph: All who swear from the torah swear and don’t pay.  These swear and take (money), a hired worker, one who was robbed, was wounded, whose opponent was suspected in his oath, and a shopkeeper with his ledger.  The hired worker how?  He said to him, give me my wage which I have in your hand, and he says, I gave it, and the other one says, you didn’t give me, he swears and takes.  Rabi Yehuda says, (he doesn’t pay) until there is in that case a bit of acknowledgement (of the claim).  How?  He said to him, give me my wage of fifty dinar that I have in your hand and he says, you got a golden dinar (twenty-five dinar).
Bet: One who was stolen from, how?  They testified about him that he entered someone else’s house to take a collateral without a right, he says, you took my vessel, and he says, I didn’t take it, behold this one may swear and take (what he claims was robbed from him).  Rabi Yehuda says, only when there is in that case a bit of acknowledgement.  How?  He said to him, you took two vessels and he says, I only took one.
Gimmel: One who was wounded how?  They testified about him that that he entered under his hand whole and exited wounded, and he said to him, you wounded me, and he says, I didn’t wound you, behold this one swears and takes.  Rabi Yehuda says, only when there is in that case a bit of acknowledgement.  How?  He said to him, you wounded me twice, and that one says, I only wounded you once.
Daled: And when his opponent is suspected about his oath how?  Whether the oath of testimony or the oath about a deposit, and even a vain oath.  If one of them was a gambler, usurer, pigeon stealer, or seller of shmitta produce, the one against him may swear and take.  If they were both suspected, the oath returns to its place (by whom it would normally be made) according to Rabi Yossi.  Rabi Meir says, they split it.
Hay: And a storekeeper based on his ledger how?  Not that he said to him, it is written in my ledger they you owe me two hundred zuz, rather that he said to him give my son two se’ah of wheat, give my workers small change worth a sela, and he says, I gave and they say we didn’t take, he swears and takes, and they swear and take.  Ben Nanas said, how?  These and these are coming to a vain oath!  Rather he takes without an oath and they take without an oath.  
Vav: He said to the storekeeper, give me a dinar of produce, and he gave it, he said, give me the dinar, and he said, I gave it to you, and you put it on the till, the homeowner must swear.  He gave him a dinar, and said to him, give me the produce, and he said, I gave it to you and you brought it home, the storekeeper must swear.  Rabi Yehuda says, whoever has the produce has the upper hand.  He said to the moneychanger, give me change for a dinar, and he gave him, he said to him, give me the dinar, he said to him, I gave it to you, and you put it on the till, the homeowner must swear.  He gave him the dinar, and said to him, give me the change, he said, I gave it to you, and you put it in your pocket, the moneychanger must swear.  Rabi Yehuda says, it is not the way of the moneychanger to give an issar until he takes a dinar.
Zayin: Just as they said, one who impairs her ktuba (says that only part of it was paid and wants the rest) does not collect except by an oath, and one witness testifies that she collected and she does not collect except by an oath, from property (which was designated for) captives and orphans she may not collect (as payment for her ktuba) except by an oath, and one who collects in her husband’s absence (from his estate) may not collect except by an oath.  So too orphans may not collect except by an oath, an oath that (they say) we didn’t instruct us or tell us and that we have not found among the documents of our father that this bill was collected (for these orphans).  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka says, even if the son was born after the death of the father, he may swear and take.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, if there are witnesses that the father said when he was going to die, this bill is not paid, he may take without an oath.
Chet: And these swear without a claim (even on suspicion), partners, sharecroppers, trustees, a woman who conducts business for the house, and a member of the household (who manages an inheritance).  One (of the above) says to him (who asks for an oath), why are you accusing me?  (He says,) I want you to swear to me, he’s chayav (to make the oath).  If partners or sharecroppers divided (their produce already), he cannot force him (the other) to swear.  If his oath was rolled (there is a concept that one can ‘roll’ an unnecessary oath into the language of a necessary oath and force one to take it) from another place, they roll it on everything.  And shvi’it cancels the oath.
