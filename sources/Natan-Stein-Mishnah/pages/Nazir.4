Aleph: One who said, behold I am a nazir and his friend herd and said, me too. (If another said) me too, they are all nezirim.  If the first was unbound, they are all unbound, if the last one is unbound, the last one is unbound and they (the rest) are all bound.  If he said, behold I am a nazir and his friend heard and said, my mouth is like his mouth and my hair is like his hair, behold he is a nazir.  Behold I am a nazir and his wife heard and said, me too, he can annul hers and his stands.  Behold I am a nezira and her husband heard and said, me too, he cannot annul.
Bet: (If a man said) behold I am a nazir (and to his wife he said) and you?  And she said, amen, he can annul hers, and his stands.  Behold I am a nezira, and you?  And he said, amen, he cannot annul hers.
Gimmel: A woman who vowed to be a nazir, drank wine, and became tame for the dead, behold she absorbs (is lashed) forty.  If her husband annulled for her, and she didn’t know that her husband had annulled fro her, and she drank wine and became tame for the dead, she does not absorb forty.  Rabi Yehuda says, if she does not absorb forty, she absorbs makat mardut (rabbinical lashes which are given based on what the person can take).
Daled: A woman who made a cow to be a nazir and she separated her animals (set aside the animals needed for her korban), and afterwards her husband annulled, if the animal was his, it goes out and grazes with the flock.  And if the animal was hers, the (animal designated for a) chatat dies (it is starved to death), the olah is brought as an olah, and the shlamim is brought as a shlamim, are eaten in one day, and do not need bread (for normally a nazir’s shlamim is brought with bread).  If she had unspecified money (she did not specify which of her korbanot for nezirut they would go to), they fall in as a donation.  If she had specified money, money for a chatat is thrown into the Dead Sea (to destroy it) and they do not benefit from it and it is not me’ila, the money for the olah, will be brought as an olah (purchase an animal to be an olah) and there is me’ila by them, and the money for shlamim, they will be brought as shlamim, they are eaten for one day, and do not need bread.
Hay: If one of the bloods (of her korbanot) was (already) thrown one her (behalf), he cannot revoke.  Rabi Akiva says, even if one of the animals was slaughtered for her, he cannot annul.  What is this talking about?  The tiglachat (shaving korban the set of which she brings at the end of nezirut) for tahara (which allows her to wine making it not a depriving vow so her husband cannot revoke it).  But in the tiglachat of tuma (if she became tame during nezirut she brings the same korbanot), he may annul, for he can say, I do not want a disgraced woman (for she must start her nezirut again, and he may object to her being a nazir).  Rabi says, even in the tiglachat of tahara he may annul, for he can say, I do not want a shaven woman (for she must shave at then end of nezirut, which is repulsive).
Vav: A man vows his son a nazir, but a woman does not vow her son a nazir.  How?  He (the son) shaved or his relative shaved him (showing that) he denied or his relatives denied.  If he had a separated animal, the chatat dies, the olah is brought as an olah.  And the shlamim is brought as a shlamim, eaten for one day, and does not need bread.  If he had unspecified money, they fall in with a donation.  Separated money, the money for the chatat go to the Dead Sea they don’t benefit from theme and there is no me’ila by them, the money for the olah they bring an olah and there is me’ila with them, and the money for shlamim, they bring shlamim, are eaten for one day, and do not need bread.
Zayin: A man may shave for his father’s nezirut, but a woman may not shave for her father’s nezirut.  How?  One whose father was a nazir and he separated unspecified money for his nezirut and died and (the son) said, behold I am a nazir on condition that I will shave with the money of my father,  Rabi Yossi said, behold these fall in with a donation, this one does not shave for the nezirut of his father.  Who shaves for the nezirut of his father?  One who he and his father vowed to be nezirim and his father set aside unspecified money for his nezirut and died, this one shaves for his father’s nezirut.
