Aleph: One who is engaged or waiting for a yavam does not drink and does not take her ktuba, as it says, “that a woman will drink under (due to) her husband,” which excludes a person who is engaged and one who is waiting for a yavam.  A widow to a kohen gadol, a divorcee or chalutza to a lay kohen, a mamzeret and a netina to a yisra’el, and a bat yisra’el to a mamzer or natin, they do not drink and do not take their ktuba.
Bet: And these do not drink and do not take their ktuba, one who says, I am tame; that witnesses came and testified that she was tame; and one who says, I am not drinking.  If her husband said, I am not making her drink; and that her husband had sex with her on the way, she takes her ktuba and does not drink.  If their (any woman who were going to drink) husbands died before they drank, Beit Shamay says, they take their ktuba and do not drink, and Beit Hillel says, they don’t drink and they don’t collect their ktuba.
Gimmel: A woman pregnant by his friend (her first husband) or nursing his friend, she does not drink and she does not take her ktuba according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, he may separate from her and take her back after some time (that of the nursing period).  An aylonit (barren woman) and an old woman who are not fit to give birth, they do not drink and they do not take their ktuba.  Rabi Eliezer says, he may marry another wife and be fruitful and multiply by her.  And all the other women, either they drink, or they don’t collect their ktuba.
Daled: The wife of a kohen drinks and is mutar to her husband.  The wife of a eunuch drinks.  They may warn for all inappropriate relations (even against secluding with her father), except for a minor, or from one who is not a man (an animal, here the warning is meaningless and she will not be forced to drink). 
Hay: And these are those who the court warns, one whose husband became deaf, became mentally infirm, or was in jail.  They (the court) said this not to make her drink, but to make her invalid from her ktuba.  Rabi Yossi says, even to make her drink, for when her husband gets out of prison, he will make her drink.
