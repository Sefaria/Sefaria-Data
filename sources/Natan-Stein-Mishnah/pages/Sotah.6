Aleph: One who warned his wife and she secluded herself (with the man he warned her against), even if he heard from a flying bird (meaning a traditionally unreliable source, as opposed to witnesses in which case he brings her to drink), he must exit (the marriage) and give her her ktuba, according to Rabi Eliezer.  Rabi Yehoshua says, until they argue, those who spin by the moon (if there are no witnesses, he requires it to be common gossip, because then it is improper for him to be married to her).
Bet: If one witness said, I saw that she became tame (defiled), she wouldn’t drink (because we believe this witness).  And not only that, even a slave or a maidservant, behold they are believed to make her invalid from her ktuba (a sota).  Her mother-in-law, her mother-in-law’s daughter, her rival (wife), her sister-in-law, and her husband’s daughter (from another wife), behold they are believed (if they say they saw her become tame, even though we generally think these women want her to be sent away), but not to make her invalid from her ktuba, but to make her not drink.
Gimmel: It would have been logical (to say,) just as the first testimony (that she secluded herself with the man) which does not make her assur (to her husband) eternally is not enacted with less than two (witnesses), (so too) the last testimony (that she was defiled) which makes her assur eternally, isn’t it logical that it will not be enacted with less than two?  (A pasuk) comes to teach us, “and there is no witness by her,” any testimony which there is by here (will make her invalid).  (There is) a kal vechomer for the first testimony from here, just as the last testimony, which makes her invalid eternally, is enacted with one witness, so too the first testimony, which does not make her assur eternally, isn’t it logical that it should be enacted with one witness?  It comes to teach us, “for he found in her a thing of nakedness,” and later he says, “based on two witnesses… a thing shall be enacted.”  Just as later it is based on two witnesses, also here based on two witnesses.
Daled: If one witness says, she became tame, and one witness says, she didn’t become tame, (or) one woman says she became tam, and a woman says, she didn’t become tame, she would drink.  One says, she became tame and two witnesses say, she didn’t become tame, she would drink.  Two said, she became tame, and one said, she didn’t become tame, she wouldn’t drink (and would be assumed tame).
