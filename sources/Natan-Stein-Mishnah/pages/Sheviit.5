Aleph: White figs, shvi’it also applies in the second year of the cycle, since they only produce every three years.  Rabi Yehuda says, Persian figs, their shvi’it is motzei shvi’it, since they only produce every two years.  They said to him, it only applies to whit figs.
Bet: One who buries luf (an onion-like plant) during shvi’it (to preserve it), Rabi Meir says not less than two se’ah, it has to be up to three tfachim, and no less than a tefach of dirt on top.  Chachamim say, no less than twelve kav (one third of Rabi Meir) and up to and covered with one tefach.  And you bury it in a place people step.
Gimmel: Luf which has remained through shvi’it, Rabi Eliezer says, if the poor picked its leaves, they picked them.  If they haven’t he must settle by giving to the poor.  Rabi Yehoshua says, if the poor picked, they picked, and if not, they don’t have a settlement.
Daled: Luf from erev shvi’it which entered shvi’it, and so too with onions, spring onions, and dyestuff from choice land, Beit Shamay says, you uproot it with wooden rakes.  Beit Hillel says, with metal spades.  But they agree by dyestuffs with lateral roots can be uprooted with metal spades.
Hay: From when can one pick luf on motzei shvi’it?  Rabi Yehuda says, immediately.  Chachamim say, once the new crop comes in.
Vav: These are tools which an artisan may not sell in shvi’it (that he suspects will be using them), a plow and its tools, a yoke, a winnow-fork, and a weeding-fork.  But he can sell a hand-sickle, a scythe, and a cart and all its tools.  This is the general rule, all tools which have specialized usage for a transgression, are assur, but those used for both transgressions and allowed work may be sold.
Zayin: A potter may sell five oil jugs and fifteen wine jugs, for one usually takes this much from hefker.  If one bought more than this, it’s mutar.  And he may sell to a non-Jew in Israel and a Jew outside of Israel.
Chet: Beit Shamay says, one may not sell a plowing cow during shvi’it.  Beit Hillel allows it, for he can shecht it.  One may sell him produce even when it’s time to sow (we assume he’ll eat it), lend him a se’ah measure even though one knows he has a threshing floor (we assume he’s measuring a small amount to be threshed), and change money even though on knows he has workers (we assume he’s covering mutar expenses).  But if he expresses any forbidden need, it is assur.
Tet: A woman may lend her friend who is suspect by shvi’it a sifter, a sieve, a hand-mill, or an oven.  But she may not sift or grind with her.  The wife of a chaver may lend to the wife of an am ha’aretz a sifter or a sieve, and she may separate, grind, or sift with her, but once she has poured water, she can’t touch it, for you don’t help those who are engaged in transgression.  And this was all said because of the ways peacefulness.  One may encourage non-Jews on shvi’it (as in, say good luck), but not a Jew.  And you greet people, out of the ways of peacefulness.
