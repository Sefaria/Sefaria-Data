Aleph: One may clear out even four or five piles of hay and produce because of guests and because of neglect of the beit midrash (to clear space for the students), but not the (entire) storehouse (for he may be flattening the floor).  One may clear out tahor truma, dmai, ma’aser rishon which had truma taken, ma’aser sheni and hekdesh which were redeemed, and dry lupine, because it is food for the poor.  But not tevel, ma’aser rishon from which truma wasn’t taken, ma’aser sheni and hekdesh which weren’t redeemed, luf, and not mustard.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel allows luf, since it is the food of ravens.
Bet: Bundles of straw, wood, or greens, if he prepared them to feed animals, he may carry them, and if not, he may not carry them.  One may turn a basket upside-down so young birds may go up and down it.  A rooster which escaped, one pushes it until it goes back in (to the coop).  One may lead a calf or pull it in a public domain.  A woman may lead her child.  Rabi Yehuda says, when?  When he takes one (foot) and rests one (a.k.a. can walk somewhat), but if he was dragging, it’s assur.
Gimmel: One may not deliver an animal (from its mother’s womb) on Yom Tov, but one may assist.  One may deliver from a woman on Shabbat, call her a midwife from this place to that, one may desecrate Shabbat for her, and one may tie the umbilical cord.  Rabi Yossi says, one may even cut it.  And all of the needs of a brit mila may be done on Shabbat.
