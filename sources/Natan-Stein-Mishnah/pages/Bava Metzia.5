Aleph: What is interest (a prohibition from the torah) and what is increase (a rabbinical extension)?  Which is interest, one who lends a sela (four dinar) for (a return of) five dinar, (lending) two se’ah of wheat for three, because it bites (from the borrower’s wealth).  What is increase, one who increases by produce.  How?  If one bought from him wheat with a golden dinar (twenty-five dinar) per kor (gave the money but did not get the produce), and that is the price, .  Wheat (increased in price and) stood at thirty dinar a kor.  He (the purchaser) said, give me my wheat, I want to buy wine with it.  He (the seller) said to him, behold your wheat are made upon me (cost me) thirty dinar a kor, behold, you can have wine by me with them (the money) and he has no wine (for while he owes him the amount of wheat he paid for, despite the loss, he is making it into credit for a different commodity and thereby avoiding his loss, which is not what the customer paid for).
Bet: One who lends his friend money, he may not live in his courtyard for free and he may not (even) rent from him for less, because this is interest.  A rental fee may be increased, but a price may not be increased.  How?  One who rents his courtyard to his friend and sys to him, if now you give me (the rent) it is for you ten sela for the year, but if you give (the rent) of the month on the month, it is a sela a month, that is mutar.  If he sold him his field, and he said to him, if you give me (the money) now, behold it is for you one thousand zuz, but if (when the grain gets) to the threshing floor, for twelve hundred zuz.
Gimmel If he sold him his field, gave him part of the money, and (the seller) said to him, when you want, bring the money and take your field (which you acquire retroactively from now), this is assur (for neither can use the field, because it would be interest either way).  If he lent him on (a mortgage of) his field and he (the lender) said to him if you do not give me from her until three years, behold it (the field) is his (the lender’s).  And Baytos ben Zonin would do like this with the consent of the Chachamim.
Daled: One may not set up with a shopkeeper for half the wage (sell to a shopkeeper at wholesale prices on condition that they split the profit), and he may not give money (to a shopkeeper) to buy with it produce to split the wage (for in both cases this money functions as half loan half investment, meaning that the investment is seen as interest), unless he gives him his wage as a worker (which would make him the manager of the investment and not benefiting from the loan).  One may not set up chickens (and eggs) for half (the profit to be made from the eggs hatching), one may not assess calves and foals for half (giving them to another to raise and then split the profit), unless he gives him wage for his toil and his food (to feed the animals).  But, one may receive calves and foals for half (the profit without an assessment, meaning there is no liability for the giver if they die) and raise them (calves) until they are a third (of their growth) and a donkey until it can carry burdens.
Hay: One may assess a cow and a donkey and whatever it does and eats for half (since it is doing work for the one raising, this is not seen as unfair interest).  In a place where they had a custom to divide the offspring (of animals when they are given to someone to raise) immediately, they divide, and a place where they have a custom to raise, they raise.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, they assess the calf with its mother and a foal with its mother.  And one may be mafriz (offer more than the asking price and use the extra as a loan to improve the land) on his field, and he does not have to worry because of interest.
Vav: One may not get tzon barzel (an agreement where one raising sheep accepts all responsibility for losses but splits profits) from a Jew, because it is interest.  But, one can accept tzon barzel from a non-Jew and borrow from them and lend to them with interest, and so too with a resident alien.  A Jew may lend (to another Jew) the money of a non-Jew (with interest to another Jew) with the knowledge of a non-Jew (where the non-Jew facilitates the transfer of a loan with interest to the non-Jew from one Jew to another) but not with the knowledge of a Jew (it there is no non-Jew with whom the loan is being transferred, i.e. if a loan to a non-Jew which has interest is being transferred directly between Jews).
Zayin: One may not make an agreement about produce until the price is put out (determined).  One the price comes out, they may make an agreement, even though this one does not have, the one does (if one of them does not have produce, he can simply use what he traded for to acquire it when the other asks for his purchase).  If he was the first of the harvesters, he may (only) make an agreement with him about a pile of grain, harvest-basket of grapes, vat of olives, clay lumps of a potter, and lime from when he sunk it in the kiln.  And he may make an agreement with him about manure all the days of the year.  Rabi Yossi says, one does not make an agreement about manure unless he had manure in a dung heap, and the Chachamim allow.  And one may make an agreement with him according to the highest market price (in the eyes of the buyer, referring to the cheapest price).  Rabi Yehuda says, even though he didn’t make an agreement with him for the highest market price, he can say to him, give me this much, or give me my money.
Chet: One may loan his tenant farmer wheat for (a return of) wheat for (use as) seed, but not for food (for one may not make a loan with a return of produce, for the price may change causing interest).  For Raban Gamliel would loan his sharecroppers wheat for what for seed, whether it was expensive and became cheap or was cheap and became expensive, he would take according to the cheap price (even if the wheat became cheaper he would only take what he gave), but not because the halacha is such, but rather because he wanted to be strict on himself.
Tet: A person may not say to his friend, lend me a kor of wheat, and I will give (back) you from the threshing floor (for if the price changes, there will be interest).  But he may say, lend me until my son comes, or, until I fink the key (so he can get to wheat which he has, meaning that the loan is intended to be for a short time), but Hillel forbade.  And so too Hillel would say, a woman may not loan a loaf to her friend until she makes money, for perhaps the price of wheat will rise and they will find themselves coming to interest.
Yud: A person may say to his friend, weed with me and I will weed with you, hoe with me and I will hoe with you, but he may not say to him, weed with me and I will hoe with you, hoe with me and I will weed with you.  All the days of the dry season are (considered) one (in length, so repaying a service from one day of the season to the other has no problem of interest) and all the days of the rainy season are one.  One may not say to him (his friend) plow with me in the dry season and I will plow with you in the rainy season.  Raban Gamliel says, there is interest which is (paid in) advance, and there is interest later.  How?  If one gave his eyes (wanted to) borrow from him (another person), was sending him (a gift), and said, so that you will lend me, this is interest in advance.  If one borrowed from someone, returned him money, was sending him, and said, for your money which was null (from your use) by me, behold this is interest later.  Rabi Shimon says, there is interest by words, one may not say to him (the lender), know that so-and-so came from such-and-such a place (and he would not have normally let the lender know).
Yud Aleph: And these transgress a lo ta’ase (negative commandment when there is a loan with interest), the lender, the borrower, the guarantor, and the witnesses.  The Chachamim also the scribe.  They transgress because of “do not give (a loan with interest),” because of, “do not take (interest) from him,” because of, “do not be to him like a creditor (with interest),” because of, “do not put upon him interest,” and because of, “and before a blind person you shall not put a stumbling block, and you shall fear from your God, I am Hashem.”
