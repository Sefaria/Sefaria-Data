Aleph: One who nightfall (starting Shabbat) came when he was on the road, he gives his purse to a non-Jew, and if there is no non-Jew with him, he lays it on his donkey.  When he reaches the outside courtyard, he removes the vessels which may be removed on Shabbat, and those which cannot be removed on Shabbat, he unties their ropes, and the bags fall from them.
Bet: One may untie bundles of sheaves before an animal, and one may separate moist cedar shoots (or else the animal cannot eat them) but not bundles of straw tied with three knots.  One may not chop up young corn or carobs before an animal, whether small or large, Rabi Yehuda allows small carobs.
Gimmel: One may not stuff a camel (with food so it will last) or cram food down its throat, but one may put food in its mouth.  One may not stuff calves, but one may put food in its mouth.  One may stuff roosters and put water in bran, but not knead it (as feed for them).  And one may not put water before bees or doves ion a birdhouse, but one may put before geese, roosters, and domesticated doves.
Daled: One may cut gourds before cattle, and a carcass before dogs.  Rabi Yehuda says, if it was not a carcass from erev Shabbat, it’s assur, since it isn’t something prepared.
Hay: One may nullify oaths on Shabbat and borrow things which are needed for Shabbat.  One may stop up an illuminating (hole) and measure a strip (of cloth which transferred tuma if it was big enough) and a mikva.  And there was once in the days of the father or Rabi Tzadok and the days of Abba Shaul ben Batnit who stopped up an illuminating hole with a pitcher (not usually used for this purpose, so theoretically assur according to the beginning of the mishna) and tied a fire pot with reed-grass, to know if there was in the tub (the size of) less than a tefach or not.  And from their actions we have learned that one may stop up, measure, and tie on Shabbat.
