Aleph: these are the things of pesach which push off Shabbat, its slaughtering, sprinkling of its blood, the cleaning of its entrails, and the burning of its chelev (fats to be burnt).  But its roasting and the rinsing of its entrails don’t push off Shabbat.  Carrying it, bringing it outside of city limits, and cutting off its wart do not push off Shabbat.  Rabi Eliezer says, they do push off.
Bet: Rabi Eliezer said, and isn’t it obvious, just as slaughtering which is because of melacha pushes off Shabbat, these which are because of shvut should push off Shabbat.  Rabi Yehoshua said to him, Yom Tov will prove, for they allowed on it because of melacha (slaughtering) and they prohibited on it because of shvut (going outside the limits).  Rabi Eliezer said to him, what is this Yehoshua?  What proof is there from an option for a commandment?  Rabi Akiva responded and said, sprinkling will prove, for this is a mitzva because of shvut and does not push off Shabbat, but you don’t be astounded by these, for even though those are a mitzva and these are because of shvut and do not push off Shabbat.  Rabi Eliezer said to him, about these I argue, and just as slaughtering which is because of a melacha pushes off Shabbat, sprinkling, which is because of shvut doesn’t push off Shabbat?  Rabi Akiva said to him, on the contrary!  Just as sprinkling which is because of shvut doesn’t push off Shabbat, slaughtering, which is because of melacha should not push off Shabbat.  Rabi Eliezer said to him, Akiva, you uprooted what is written in the torah, “bein ha’arbayim… at its time,” whether weekday or Shabbat.  He said to him, rebbe, give me a time for these as we have a time for slaughtering.  Rabi Akiva said a general rule, any melacha which one can do from erev Shabbat doesn’t push off Shabbat, and slaughtering, which one can’t do from erev Shabbat, pushes off Shabbat.
Gimmel: When does he bring a chagiga with it?  When he is coming on a weekday, tame, and it (the pesach) is (too) small (for the group of eaters).  When he comes on Shabbat with many and tame, he does not bring a chagiga with it.
Daled: A chagiga comes from the flocks, cattle, sheep, goats, mountain goats, and ewes.  And it may be eaten for two nights and one day.
Hay: A pesach which they slaughtered not for its sake on Shabbat, he is chayav a chatat (for breaking Shabbat).  And all other zvachim (on Shabbat) which he slaughtered in the reason of a pesach, if they are not fit (to be a pesach, a.k.a. not the same type of animal) he is chayav, and if they are fit, Rabi Eliezer makes chayav a chatat, and Rabi Yehoshua exempts.  Rabi Eliezer said, just as a pesach, which is allowed for its sake, and when he changes its sake (the intention) he’s chayav, so too all zvachim, which are assur (even) for their sake, when he changes its sake, shouldn’t it be chayav?  Rabi Yehoshua said to him, no, if you say by a pesach for he changed it to something assur, would you say by zvachim that he changed it to something mutar?  Rabi Eliezer said to him, public offerings will prove, for they are mutar for their sake, and one who slaughters (other sacrifices) for their sake is chayav.  Rabi Yehoshua said to him, no, if you said by public offerings which have a limit, would you say that by a pesach which has not limit?  Rabi Meir says, even one who slaughters (other sacrifices) for the sake of a public offering is patur.
Vav: If he slaughtered for those who don’t eat or aren’t participants, or for uncircumcised or tame, he’s chayav.  For those who eat it and those who don’t, for its participants and not its participants, for circumcised and uncircumcised or tahor or tame, he’s patur.  If he slaughtered it and found it to be blemished, he’s chayav.  If he slaughtered and found it to be internally torn, he’s patur.  If he slaughtered it and found out the owners withdrew (from this sacrifice), died, or became tame, he’s patur, since he slaughtered with permission.
