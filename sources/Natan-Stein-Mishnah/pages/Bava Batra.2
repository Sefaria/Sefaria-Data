Aleph: A person may not dig a hole (to collect water) near the hole of his friend, and not a trench, not a cave, not a water channel, and not a washer’s pool, unless he distanced it from his friend’s wall (of the hole) by three tfachim, and he plasters it with lime (so it does not compromise the strength of his friend’s hole).  They distance (a hole with) olive peat, manure, salt, lime, and rocks from the wall of his friend (for these can ruin the water in the hole) by three tfachim and he plasters with lime (so it does not damage his friend’s hole).  They distance seeds, a plow, and urine from the wall by three tfachim.  And they distance (from a friend’s hole) millstones three (tfachim) from the bottom millstone which is four from the top millstone (for the vibration may cause ht hole to collapse), and an oven, three from the base which is four from the lip (of the oven).
Bet: A person may not stand an oven within the house, unless it has on top of it a height of four amot.  If he stands it in the upper room, there must be below it (a floor) of cement three tfachim (thick), and for a stove a tefach (of cement floor).  And it damaged, he pays what it damaged.  Rabi Shimon says, they did not say all of these measurements, rather if it damaged (with these measurements in place) he is exempt from paying.
Gimmel: A person may not open a store of a baker or dyer under the storage room of his friend, and not a cow barn (dairy).  Really, with wine (in the upper room) they permitted, but not a dairy (below, for that will affect even wine).  A store which is in a (jointly owned) courtyard, he (the other owner of the courtyard) can protest and say to him, I cannot sleep because of the noise of those who enter and the noise of those who leave (the shop) One who makes vessels goes out and sells in the shuk, but (if he makes the vessels in the joint courtyard) he (the other owner) cannot protest and say to him, I cannot sleep from the sound of the hammer, not from the sound of the millstones, and not from the sound of the children (if he runs a school).
Daled: One whose wall was close to his friend’s wall, he may not make another wall close to it unless he distanced from it by four amot (to leave room for pedestrians to walk through).  And (if he wishes to build a wall close to someone else’s) windows, (he must distance) above them, below them, and in front of them four amot.
Hay: One distances a ladder from a dovecote four amot, such that a marten will not jump (up the ladder to attack the doves), and (one distances) a wall from a gutter by four amot so that he may stand a latter (against the gutter to go clean it).  One distances a dovecote from the city fifty amot (so the doves of another person are not attracted to it, which would be stealing), and a person may not set up a dovecote in his (property) unless he has fifty amot in every direction.  Rabi Yehuda says, space for four kor, the full flight distance of a dove.  But if he bought it even (if it was on only) the space of a rova, behold it is in his holding.
Vav: A young bird which was found within fifty amot (of a dovecote) behold it is (property) of the owner of the dovecote.  (If it was found) outside of fifty amot, behold it is of its finder.  If it was found between two dovecotes, if it was closer to this, it is his, closer to that, it is his, half by half (exactly in the middle), the two of them split.
Zayin: One distances a tree from the town twenty-five amot, and by a carob and a sycamore fifty amot (because a city gets a public open area around it).  Abba Shaul says, any serak (non fruit-bearing) tree fifty amot.  If the city came first, he (a resident of the city) may cut it down (a tree which is planted too close) and he does not give its money (to the owner), but if the tree came first, he cuts it down and gives the money, if it was a dout if this cam first, a doubt if that came first, he cuts down and does not give the money.
Chet: One distances a set threshing floor from the city fifty amot.  A person may not make a set threshing floor in his (property) unless he has fifty amot in every direction, and he distances it from the planings of his friend or his plowed field so that it will not damage.
Tet: One distances nevelot (animals which died naturally), graves, and a tannery fifty amot from the city,  One may not make a tannery other than to the east of the city (so the odor will not be carried to the city, for odors carry best on the east wind).  Rabi Akiva says, he may make it in any direction except for west, and he distances it fifty amot.
Yud: One distances a soaking (area for flax) from vegetables, leek from onions, and mustard from bees.  Rabi Yossi allows with mustard.
Yud Aleph: One distances a tree from a hole (cistern) twenty-five amot, and with a carob and sycamore fifty amot, whether above (on a hill) or on the side (on flat ground).  If the hole came first, he cuts down and fives money, but if the tree came first, he may not cut down.  If it’s a doubt if this came first, a doubt if that cam first, he may not cut down.  Rabi Yossi says, even if the hole came before the tree he may not cut down, for this one is digging (a hole) in his (land) and this one is planting (a tree) in his 9there is no damage at the time of planting, only later).
Yud Bet: A person may not plant a tree near his friend’s field unless he distanced 9the tree) from it four amot, whether (he is planting) vines or any tree.  If there was a fence between, this one may come close to the fence on this side and that one may come close to the fence on that side.  If his roots went out into his friend’s (field) he (the friend) may lower them (cut them) up to three tfachim so that it does not hinder the plow.  If he was digging a hole, trench, or cave, he may cut and go down (continue digging) and the wood is his.
Yud Gimmel: A tree which is turning towards (growing over) his friend’s field, he (the friend) may cut it the full (height) of the handle on the plow, and a carob and sycamore according to a plumb line (if branches extend over his field, no matter how high, he may cut them).  An irrigated field, all trees are according to the plumb line.  Abba Shaul says, all serak trees are according to a plumb line.
Yud Daled: A tree which is turning towards the public domain one may cut down such that a camel may pass with its rider.  Rabi Yehuda says, all trees are according to the plumb line because of tuma (for this can make a person tame by being under a covering with a corpse).
