Aleph: There are four (types of) watchmen, an unpaid guard, a borrower, a paid guard, and a renter.  An unpaid guard swears (and exempts himself from paying if the object is not returned for whatever reason) on everything, and a borrower pays for everything.  A paid guard and a renter swear on something broken, captured, or dead, and pay for something lost or stolen.
Bet: He said to the unpaid guard, where is my ox, and he said it died, and it broke (was injured), was captured, was stolen, or was lost; it broke and it died, was captured, was stolen, or was lost; it was captured and it died, broke, was stolen, or was lost; it was stolen and it died, broke, was captured, or was lost; or it was lost and it died, broke, was captured, or was stolen, I make you swear and he says, amen, he’s patur (for he saved himself nothing by lying).
Gimmel: (The owner asked) where is my ox?  And he (the guard) said, I don’t know what you’re talking about, and it died, broke, was captured, was stolen, or was lost, I make you swear, and he says, amen, he’s patur.  Where is my ox?  He said, it was lost, I make you swear, and he says, amen, and witnesses testify that he ate it, he pays the principle.  If he admitted himself, he pays the principle, chomesh, and brings a korban asham.  Where is my ox, he said, it was stolen, I make you swear, and he says, amen, and witnesses testify that he himself stole it, he pays kefel.  If he admitted himself, he pays the principle, chomesh, and a korban asham.
Daled: If he said to someone in the shuk, where is my ox that you stole, and he says, I didn’t steal it, and witnesses testify that he stole it, he pays kefel.  If he slaughtered or sold it, he pays restitutions of four or five times.  If he saw witnesses approaching and he says, I stole it, but I didn’t slaughter or sell it, he only pays principle.
Hay: He said to a borrower, where is my ox?  He said, it died, and it broke, was captured, was stolen, or was lost; broke, and it died, was captured, was stolen, or was lost; was captured, and it died, broke, was stolen, or was lost; was stolen, and it died, broke, was captured, or was lost; or was lost, and it died, broke, was captured, or was stolen, I make you swear, and he says, amen, he’s patur (he has to pay either way).
Vav: Where is my ox?  And he said, I don’t know what you’re talking about, and it died, broke, was captured, was stolen, or was lost, I make you swear, and he says, amen, he’s chayav.  He said to a paid guard or a renter, where is my ox?  And he said, it died, and it broke or was captured; it broke and it died or was captured; it was captured, and it died or broke; it was stolen, and it was lost; or it was lost, and it was stolen, I make you swear, he says amen, and he’s patur.

It was lost or stolen and it died, broke, or was captured, I make you swear, he says, amen, he’s patur.  This is the general rule, (changing circumstances) from obligation to obligation, innocence to innocence, or innocence to obligation, he’s patur.  From obligation to innocence, he’s chayav.  This is the general rule, anyone who swears to make easier upon himself is chayav, and to make more stringent upon himself is patur.
