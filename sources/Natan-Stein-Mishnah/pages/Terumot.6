Aleph: One who accidentally eats truma pays the principal value and adds chomesh (one fifth of the whole amount paid, or one quarter of the original value).  Whether he eats it, drinks it, anoints with it, whether tahor or tame truma, he pays a fifth (and if he accidentally eats that he also pays) a fifth of a fifth.  He doesn’t pay with truma, rather with tithed chulin, and they become truma.  And the restitution is truma also.  Even if the kohen wants to forgo it, he cannot forgo.
Bet: The daughter of a yisra’el who ate truma and then married a kohen, if she ate truma the kohen hadn’t acquired, she pays the value and keeps the chomesh.  If he had acquired it, she pays the value to the owners and keeps the chomesh, as is said, one who accidentally eats truma pays the owners the principal and chomesh for whoever wants.
Gimmel: One who feeds his workers and guests truma pays the principal and they pay chomesh according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, they pay the principal and the chomesh, and he pays them the value of their meal.
Daled: One who steals truma but didn’t eat it pays double the principal value (kefel).  If he ate it, he pays double the principal and chomesh, one principal and chomesh from chulin and one principal from truma.  One who stole truma which a kohen made hekdesh pays two chumshim and one principal, for there is no kefel by hekdesh.
Hay: One may not pay from leket, shichicha, pe’ah, hefker, ma’aser rishon that has had truma taken, or ma’aser sheni or hekdesh that have been redeemed, for hekdesh cannot redeem hekdesh, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim allow these.
Vav: Rabi Eliezer says, one may pay (back for truma) with one kind for another, as long as he pays from the superior on the inferior.  Rabi Akiva says, you may only pay for one kind with the same one, therefore, if he ate squash on erev shvi’it, he waits for squash of motzei shvi’it and pays from them.  From the same source that Rabi Eliezer is lenient Rabi Akiva is stringent, as it says, “and you shall give to the kohen that which is holy.”  Anything which is fit to become holy, according to Rabi Eliezer.  Rabi Akiva says from there, the holy thing which he ate.
