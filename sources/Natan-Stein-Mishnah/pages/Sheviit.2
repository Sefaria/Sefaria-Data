Aleph: Until when may one plow in a ‘white’ field (not trees) be plowed on erev shvi’it?  Until the moisture has dried up, as long as people plow to plant squash and gourds.  Rabi Shimon said, you give law for each person individually (for fields dry up at different times).  Rather in a field until Pesach and an orchard until Shavuot.
Bet: One spreads manure and hoes squash and gourds until Rosh Hashana.  And so too in irrigated fields.  One may cut off flaws, strip leaves, cover up, or smoke out until Rosh Hashana.  Rabi Shimon says, one may even remove a leaf from a cluster of grapes on shmitta.
Gimmel: One may clear stones until Rosh Hashana.  One may clip, prune, and trim until Rosh Hashana.  Rabi Yehoshua says, like clipping and pruning of the fifth year (which continue into the next year) are clipping and pruning of the sixth year.  Rabi Shimon says, whenever I may work on a tree (until Shavuot) I may trim.
Daled: One may smear wounds on saplings with dung, wrap them, trim them, make shelter for them, and water them until Rosh Hashana.  Rabi Elazar ben Tzadok says, even during shmitta you may water the branches but not the trunk.
Hay: One may oil unripe figs and pierce them until Rosh Hashana.  Unripe figs of erev shvi’it that entered shvi’it and those of shvi’it that entered motzei shvi’it may not be oiled or pierced.  Rabi Yehuda says, a place where they would oil, they don’t oil, for it’s work, and a place where they don’t oil, you may oil.  Rabi Shimon allows work on a tree (even though it is shvi’it fruit), for work on a tree is allowed (in the eighth year).
Vav: One may not plant, make runners, or graft erev shvi’it less than thirty days before Rosh Hashana.  If you planted, made runners, or grafted, you must uproot it.  Rabi Yehuda says, any grafting that has not taken root in three days will never take root.  Rabi Yossi and Rabi Shimon say, two weeks.
Zayin: Rice, millet, poppy, and sesame which grew roots before Rosh Hashana, you take ma’aser for the past year, and they are allowed on shvi’it.  And if not, they are assur on shvi’it and you take ma’aser the next year.
Chet: Rabi Shimon Shezuri says, Egyptian bean that was planted, but for the purpose of seeds, by the beginning of shvi’it has the same rules as above.  Rabi Shimon says, large peas are also like them.  Rabi Elazar says, large peas if they began to form pods before Rosh Hashana.
Tet: Seedless onions and Egyptian beans which one prevented from getting water starting thirty days before Rosh Hashana, one takes ma’aser with the past year, and they are allowed on shvi’it.  If not, they are forbidden on shvi’it, and one takes ma’aser with the coming year.  In a rain irrigated field, if one prevented them from getting water for two seasons, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say three seasons.
Yud: Gourds which one made for seeds, if they hardened before Rosh Hashana and become unfit as human food, if is mutar to keep them during shvi’it.  If not, it is assur to keep them on shvi’it.  Their truma is assur on shvi’it. And one may water ‘white’ soil (non-orchard) according to Rabi Shimon.  Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov forbids it.  One may soak rice on shvi’it.  Rabi Shimon says, but you don’t trim the leaves.
