Aleph: A woman to whom property fell (though inheritance) before she was betrothed, Beit Shamay and Beit Hillel agree that she may sell it or give it away and it stands (her husband has no claim in it and cannot stop her).  If they fell to her after she was betrothed, Beit Shamay says, she may sell it, and Beit Hillel says, she may not sell it.  And both agree that if she sold it or gave it away, it stands.  Rabi Yehuda said, they said before Raban Gamliel since he merited (to have) the woman doesn’t he merit the property?  He said to them, we are embarrassed (unsure a ruling like this) on the new (property which she gets while married) and you want us to roll it (the ruling) onto the old (property which she got before marriage).  If they fell to her after she married, both agree that if she sold it or gave it away, the husband may take it from the hand of the takers.  If (she got the property) before she married, and (then) she married, Raban Gamliel says, if she sold it or gave it away, it stands.  Rabi Chanina ben Akavia said, they said before Raban Gamliel since he merited the woman doesn’t he merit the property?  He said to them, we are embarrassed on the new and you want us to roll it onto the old.
Bet: Rabi Shimon separates between (certain) properties and (certain other) properties, property which is known to the husband she may not sell, and if she sold it or gave it away, it is invalid.  (Properties) which aren’t known to the husband, she may not sell, and if she sold it or gave it away, it stands.
Gimmel: Money fell to her, land should be purchased with it and he eats the fruit (benefits from it).  Fruit which is detached from the land (which fell to her), land should be bought with them and he eats the fruits.  Those connected to the ground, Rabi Meir says, they evaluate how much it (the land) is worth with the fruits, and how much it is worth without the fruit, and the excess, land should be purchased with it and he eats the fruit.  And the Chachamim say, those connected to the land are his, and those separated from it are hers, and land should be bought with them and he eats the fruit.
Daled: Rabi Shimon says, a place (case) where he is more powerful when marrying her (he benefits from the property) he is less powerful when divorcing her, and a place where he is less powerful when marrying her (he does not benefit from the property) he is more powerful when divorcing her.  (For example) fruits attached to the ground, when he marries her are his, and when he divorces her are hers (for the property came into the marriage through her) and those separated from the ground (with which land was bought) when he marries her are hers and when he divorces her are his (since her receives the benefits of this property, and the detached fruits were benefits arising during marriage).
Hay: Old slaves and maidservants fell to her, they should be sold and land should be purchased with it, and he eats the fruits.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, they should not be sold, for they are the pride of the father’s house (they have gotten old with the father).  If old olive (trees) and vines fell to her, they should be sold for wood and land should be bought with it, and he eats the fruits.  Rabi Yehuda says, they should not be sold, for they are the pride of the father’s house (they are prized crops).  One who spends money on the property of his wife, if he spent a lot and ate a little or (spent) a little and ate a lot, what he spent he spent, and what he ate he ate.  If he spent but did not eat, he swears how much he spent and takes (that much).
Vav: One who is waiting for her brother in law to whom property fell (she inherited property), Beit Hillel and Beit Shamay agree that she sells it or gives it away and it stands.  If shed died, what should they do with her ktuba (the value promised to her if her husband dies) and the property which comes in and goes out with her (her nichsei melog, things which were hers throughout marriage, but the husband receives the benefit from)?  Beit Shamay says, the heirs of the husband (who died) split with the heirs of the father (her father).  Beit Hillel says, the property (nichsei tzon barzel, which the wife brings into the marriage, but the husband owns and is responsible for) is for them (both parties), the ktuba belongs to the heirs of the husband, and the property which comes in and out with her belongs to the heirs of the father.
Zayin: If his (the yavam’s) brother (her husband) left money, land should be bought with it, and he (the yavam) eats the fruit.  (If the brother left) fruits separated from the land, land should be bought with it and he eats the fruit.  If they are attached to the ground, Rabi Meir said, they assess how much the (the lands) are worth with the fruit and how much they are worth without the fruit and the excess, they should buy land with it and he eats the fruit.  And the Chachamim say, fruit connected to the ground is his and those separated from the ground, whoever comes first merits them, if he (the yavam) came first he merited, if she came first, land should be bought with it and he benefits.  If he married her, behold she is like his wife in all things except that her ktuba will be on the property of her first husband (if she gets her ktuba, it comes from the property of her first husband).
Chet: He (the yavam) may not say to her, behold your ktuba is resting on the table (the amount of your ktuba is yours and I am selling the rest of your first husband’s property), rather all (of the dead brother’s) property is responsible for her ktuba (the yavam may not sell it).  And so too a man may not say to his wife, behold your ktuba is resting on the table, rather all of his property is responsible for her ktuba.  If he (the yavam) divorced her, she only has (gets) her ktuba.  If he took her back, behold she is like all women, but she only gets her first ktuba (from her first husband).
