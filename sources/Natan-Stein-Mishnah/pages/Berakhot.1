Aleph: Discusses the time of ma’ariv.  Rabi Eliezer – shkiyah – four at night.  Chachamim – until chatzot (6 at night).  Raban Gamliel says whenever the Chachamim say all night it’s until a lot hashachar, it’s just a siyag.
Bet: Discusses zman kriyat shma.  Tana Kama – light enough to differentiate between white and tchelet.  Rabi Eliezer – between tchelet and green.  Until netz.  Rabi Yehoshua says until three during the day, because kings get up then.  If you read after that, you’re yotze, just as if you read it in the torah.
Gimmel: Beit Shamay: beshochbecha uvkumecha denotes position.  Beit Hillel: u’velechtecha baderech means you say it any way, that only dictates the times.  Rav Tarfon followed Beit Shamay and put himself in danger.  They said you deserved it, you didn’t follow Beit Hillel.
Daled: Shacharit has two brachot before and one after kriyat shma, ma’ariv has two and two – one long and one short.  You can’t change the formulation of brachot, i.e. long/ short, chatima/ no,
Hay: You mention yetziat mitzrayim at night.  Rav Elazar Ben Azariah  says, I never got this until Ben Zoma explained it means day and night.  Chachamim say it means for this world and for when mashiach comes.
