Aleph: One who sleeps under a bed in a sukka did not fulfill his obligation.  Rabi Yehuda said, we used to do, that we would lie under a bed in front of the elders, and they didn’t say anything to us.  Rabi Shimon said, there was a story with Tavi the slave of Raban Gamliel who would sleep under a bed, and Raban Gamliel said to the elders, you see my slave Tavi, he is a scholar and knows that slaves are exempt from the (mitzva of) sukka, and therefore he is sleeping under the bed.  And from our ways (experiences) we have learned that one who sleeps under a bed does not fulfill his obligation.
Bet: One who supports his sukka with the legs of a bed, it is valid.  Rabi Yehuda says, if it cannot stand on its own, it is invalid.  A sukka in disarray, or its shade is more than its sun is valid.  One which is (covered) thick like a house, even though one cannot see the stars from inside it, it is valid.
Gimmel: One who makes a sukka on a wagon or a boat, it is valid, and on may go up into it on Yom Tov.  On a tree or a camel, it’s valid, and one may not go up onto it on Yom Tov.  If two (walls) were in (made of) a tree and one was manmade, or two manmade and one by a tree, it’s valid, and one may not go into it on Yom Tov.  Three manmade and one by a tree, it’s valid, and one may go into it on Yom Tov.  This is the general rule, all which the tree is removed and it can stand on its own is valid, and one may go into it on Yom Tov.
Daled: One who makes his sukka between trees, and the trees are walls for it, it’s valid.  Those who are messengers for a mitzva are exempt from the sukka.  Sick people and their attendants are exempt from the sukka.  One may eat and drink randomly (a small meal) outside the sukka.
Hay: Once they brought to Raban Yochanan ben Zakai to taste a dish, and (people brought) to Raban Gamliel two dates and a bucket of water, and they said, bring them up to the sukka.  And when they gave to Rabi Tzadok food less than a kbeitza, he took it in a napkin and ate it outside of the sukka and did not bless after it.
Vav: Rabi Eliezer says, one must eat fourteen meals in a sukka, one in the day and one at night.  Chachamim say, the thing has no set number, except for the nights of the first Yom Tov of Sukkot alone.  And furthermore said Rabi Eliezer, one who didn’t eat the nights of the first Yom Tov will fill in the nights of the last Yom Tov.  And Chachamim say, there is no fill in for this matter, as it says, “what is bent cannot be straightened, and what is missing cannot be counted full.”
Zayin: One who has his head and his bulk (most of his body) in the sukka and his table is in the house, Beit Shamay invalidates, and Beit Hillel validates.  Beit Hillel said to Beit Shamay, wasn’t there a story that the elders of Beit Shamay and the elders of Beit Hillel went to visit Rabi Yochanan ben Hachorani, and they found that he was sitting with his head in the sukka and his table in the house, and they said nothing to him?  Beit Shamay said to them, from there is a proof?  They actually said to him, if this is how you have acted, you never fulfilled the mitzva of sukka in all of your days.
Chet: Women, slaves, and minors are patur from sukka.  A minor who doesn’t need his mother (is independent) is chayav in sukka.  There was a story where the daughter-in-law of Shamay the elder gave birth, and he opened the plaster (of the ceiling) and put schach on top of the bed for the child.
Tet: All the seven days a person makes his sukka set (as his place to live) and his home casual (he passes through).  If rain falls, from when may he leave?  From when the porridge gets ruined.  They made a parable, to what is the thing similar?  To a servant who comes to mix a cup (of wine) for his master, and he (the master) dumped the jug on his face.
