Aleph: One was allowed to exchange shkalim for darics (a gold coin worth two sela) so it wouldn’t be a burden during the journey.  Just as there were shofarot (a shofar shaped collecting bin) in the Beit Hamikdash, so too there were shofarot in the country.  Townspeople who sent their half-shkalim and they were stolen or lost, if the (funding for) truma was already withdrawn, he would swear to the treasurer, and if not, he would swear to the townspeople, and they would contribute for him.  If they were found or the thieves returned them, both are given as half-shekels, but the recovered aren’t given until the following year.
Bet: One who gives his half-shekel to give on his behalf, but he (the friend) contributes it himself, if the truma has already been withdrawn, he stole kodesh (committed me’ila).  One who gives his half-shekel from hekdesh, if truma has been taken and the animal was sacrificed, he’s done me’ila.  If it is from the money for ma’aser sheni or shvi’it, he must eat an equivalent value.(in Jerusalem).
Gimmel: One who collected up coins and said, these are going towards my shekel, Beit Shamay says, any extra must be a donation to the Beit Hamikdash.  Beit Hillel says, they may be used as general money.  If he said, these are for a chatat, the extra must be a donation.  If he said, that I will bring from these a chatat, the extra is general money.
Daled: Rabi Shimon said, what’s the difference between shkalim and chatat?  Shkalim have a set limit, but a chatat doesn’t.  Rabi Yehuda says, so too shkalim don’t have a set limit, for when the Jews returned from exile they gave darics (four shekels of the mishna, or two of the torah), the then brought selas (two shekels), then they brought tva’in (half sela, the right amount), and they wanted to bring dinars (which was too little).  Rabi Shimon said, despite this, they all still paid the same amount, whereas a chatat, this one can bring a sela, and that can bring two (sela’s-worth), and that brings three.
Hay: Extra for the shekel is general money.  Extra from the tenth of the epha (chatat), the bird offering for a zav, zava, or woman who has just given birth, a chatat, or an asham, is a donation.  This is the general rule, anything which is going to be used for a chatat or asham, the extra is a donation.  Extra from an olah is for an olah.  Extra from a mincha is for a mincha.  Extra from a shlamim is for a shlamim.  Extra from a pesach is for a shlamim.  Extra from nezirim (collected for poor nezirim) is for nezirim.  Extra from a nazir is a donation.  Extra from money for the poor is for the poor.  Extra money for a specific poor person is for that person.  Extra money for captives if for captives.  Extra money for a specific captive is for that captive.  Extra money for the dead is for the dead.  Extra money for a specific dead person is for his heirs.  Rabi Meir says, extra from money for a specific dead person should be left until Eliyahu comes.  Rabi Natan says extra money for a specific dead person is use to build a monument on his grave.
