Aleph: How do witnesses (not) become zomemim (false witnesses)?  (They say) we testify that this person is the son of a divorcee or one who got chalitza.  We don’t say, let’s make this one the son of a divorcee or widow, rather we give him forty lashes.  We testify about this person that he must be exiled.  We don’t say, they’ll be exiled in his stead, rather, he gets forty lashes.  We testify that this man divorced his wife, but didn’t pay his ktuba (prenuptial agreement), whether today whether tomorrow, isn’t he going to pay the ktuba?  We evaluate how much one would pay for this ktuba for if she becomes a widow or divorced, and if she dies, her husband inherits it.  We testify that this person owes his friend one thousand zuz, and he owes him within thirty days, and he says he owes in ten years.  They evaluate how much a person would pay if he had a thousand zuz and instead of having to pay in thirty days, he had to pay in ten years.
Bet: We testify that this person owes his friend two hundred zuz, they are whipped and pay, for what makes him get lashes is not what makes him pay, according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, anyone who pays isn’t whipped.
Gimmel: People who testify that so-and-so is chayav lashes, and they are found to be zomemim, they get eighty lashes, because of, “you shall not bear upon your friend as a false witness,” and because, “and you shall do to them as what they falsified,” according to Rabi Meir.  Chachamim say, the only get forty lashes.  The split money but not lashes.  When?  They testified that one owed his friend 200 zuz, and they are found to be zomemim, they split it, but if they testify that he is chayav forty lashes and are found to be zomemim, they each get forty lashes.
Daled: Witnesses do not become zomemim until they are invalidated themselves.  When?  They say, we testify that so-and-so killed a person.  They (a second pair of witnesses) said to them, how can you testify, the victim or the murderer was with us that day is such-and-such a place, these are not zomemim.  But if they said to them, how can you testify, for you were with us on that day in such-and-such a place, these are zomemim, and they can be killed based on the latter witnesses’ statements.
Hay: If two other witnesses came and they made them zomemim, and two more came and they made them zomemim, even if one hundred pairs came, they all die as zomemim.  Rabi Yehuda says, this is a conspiracy (the first pair has decided to protect the defendant and make any witnesses who come zomemim), and the only pair that will die is the first pair (who were made zomemim).
Vav: Edim zomemim are only killed once the trial (of the original defendant) is finished.  For behold, the Tzedukim would say, until the person dies, as it says, “a life in place of a life.”  The Chachamim said to them, hasn’t it already been said, “and you shall do to him as he intended to falsify about his friend,” and behold, his friend is alive!  If so, why does it say, “a life in place of a life?”  One might have thought it was from the time the testimony was received, making him liable to die.  The torah teaches, “a life in place of a life,” behold, they aren’t killed until the judgment is finished.
Zayin: “Based on two witnesses or three witnesses will the one who will the person die.”  If the judgment stands based on two, why did the pasuk make a case of three?  Rather they compare the three to the two, just as three can make two zomemim, two can make three zomemim.  And how do we know they can even make a hundred zomemim?  The torah teaches, “edim.”  Rabi Shimon says, just as two aren’t killed until they are both zomemim, so too three aren’t killed until they are all zomemim.  And how do we know even a hundred?  The torah teaches, “edim.”  Rabi Akiva says, the third only comes to make the sentence more stringent and like the other two (i.e. we don’t simply take the first two and ignore the third), and if so the pasuk punished those who join sinners as those who sin, how much more so Hashem will give reward to those who join those who do mitzvot as those who do mitzvot.
Chet: Just as with two, if one of them is found to be a relative or invalid their testimony is invalid, so too with three if one of them is found to be a relative or invalid their testimony is invalid.  How do we know this holds for even a hundred?  The torah teaches, “edim.”  Rabi Yossi said, what is this talking about?  Capital cases, but in monetary cases, the testimony can be held up by the leftover witnesses.  Rabi says, it applies to both capital and monetary cases, if they (the invalid witnesses) warned them (the defendant, showing they intended to testify), but if they didn’t warn them (and didn’t intend to testify), what should two brothers do with one who saw a person killing with them (can’t one of them testify with the third person)?
Tet: If two people saw him (the accused) from this window, and two people saw him from that window and one is warning him in the middle, if they see one another, they provide a single testimony, but if they don’t they provide two testimonies.  Therefore, if one of them was found to be a zomem, he and they die, but the second group is patur.  Rabi Yossi says, we never put to death until two witnesses warn him, as it says, “from the mouth of two witnesses.”  Alternatively, “from the mouth of two witnesses,” teaches that the Sanhedrin may not listen to a translator.
Yud: One whose trial was completed and he fled, and he came before the same court, they do not void his sentence.  Wherever two people stand and say, we testify about such-and-such that he was sentenced in the court so-and-so, and such-and-such are hit witnesses, behold, he will be killed.  The Sanhedrin has jurisdiction in Israel and outside of it.  A Sanhedrin which kills once every seven years is called bloodthirsty.  Rabi Elazar ben Azariah said, once every seventy years.  Rabi Tarfon and Rabi Akiva say, if we were on the Sanhedrin, we would never kill someone.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel said, they surely would have increased the number of murderers in Israel.
