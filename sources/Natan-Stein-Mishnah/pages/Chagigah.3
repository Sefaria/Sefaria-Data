Aleph: Kodesh is more stringent than truma, for one may immerse vessels inside vessels for truma, but not for kodesh (where vessels must be immersed in the mikva one by one).  (Vessels are considered to have independent) back, inside, and handle for truma, but not so by kodesh.  One who carries midras carries truma (at the same time as long as they don’t touch), but he may not carry kodesh.  The clothes of one who eats truma are midras for (eaters of) kodesh.  Dealing with kodesh is not like dealing truma, for (if he wants to immerse a garment with a knot) in kodesh, he unties, he dries, he immerses, and then ties, and in truma he ties (and may leave it like that) and immerses.
Bet: Vessels which were completed in tahara (although that type of vessel could become tame) need immersion for kodesh, but not for truma.  A vessel unites (in tuma) all things inside of it for kodesh (i.e. something in a vessel with an object which touched a tame object is assur for kodesh) but not for truma (it is mutar to have with truma).  The fourth (in tuma, where it has three intermediaries with a source of tuma) with kodesh is invalid, and the third (in tuma) in truma (is pasul).  In truma, if one of his hands became pasul, its friend (the other hand) is tahor, and in kodesh, they immerse both, for a hand makes its friend tame, though not in truma.
Gimmel: One may eat dry foods (which do not generally become tame) which are truma with defiled (tame) hands, but not kodesh.  A griever and one who lacks atonement (lacks sacrifices as the final step of becoming tahor) need immersion for kodesh, but not for truma.
Daled: Truma is stringent (more than kodesh), for in Yehuda, they are trusted about the tahara of wine and oil all the days of the year, and in the time of (using) the winepresses and the olive presses, truma as well.  If the time of the winepresses and the olive presses passed, and they brought him a barrel of truma wine, he will not accept it, but he (the am ha’aretz who is not trusted) should leave it for the next (time of the) winepress.  And if he (the am ha’aretz) says to him, (the kohen) I separated into it (i.e. in this barrel) a revi’it of kodesh, he is trusted.  Jugs of wine and jugs of oil which are meduma (a mix of truma and chulin which is only eaten by a kohen), they are believed (about their status) in the days of the winepresses and olive presses, and before the winepresses seventy days.
Hay: From Modi’it and inward (toward Yerushalayim, potters) are believed about earthenware vessels (being tahor).  From Modi’it outward they are not believed.  How?  A potter who sells pots comes into (the area between Yerushalayim and) Modi’it, he is (the same) potter, they are (the same) pots, and they are (the same) customers, he is trusted.  If he leaves, he isn’t trusted.
Vav: (Tax) collectors who enter the house (to take collateral), and so too thieves who returned vessels, they are believed to say, we didn’t touch (anything in a way to make it tame).  In Yerushalayim, they are believed about kodesh, and at the time of the festival even on truma.
Zayin: One who opens his barrel (of wine and an am ha’aretz touched it) or one who begins (to sell) his dough before the festival (and an am ha‘aretz touched it), Rabi Yehuda says, let him finish (selling as tahor, for at this time even amei ha’aretz are thought to be generally tahor).  Chachamim say, he may not finish.  Once the festival passed, they would remove (objects) for the tahara of the sanctuary.  If the festival ended on Friday, they would not remove out of honor for Shabbat.  Rabi Yehuda says, even not on Thursday, for the kohanim aren’t free.
Chet: How do they remove for the tahara of the sanctuary.  They would immerse the vessels which were in the Beit Hamikdash, and they say to them (to kohanim who are amei ha’aretz), be careful not to touch the table and make it tame.  All the vessels which were in the Beit Hamikdash, they had seconds and thirds, for if the firsts became tame they bring the seconds in their place.  All the vessels which were in the Beit Hamikdash need immersing, except for the golden mizbe’ach and the copper mizbe’ach, since they are earth, according to Rabi Eliezer.  Chachamim say, because they are plated.
