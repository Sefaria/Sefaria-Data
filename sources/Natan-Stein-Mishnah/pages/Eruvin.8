Aleph: How does one participate in (an eruv) tchumin (to extend the city limits)?  One sets down a barrel and says, this is for all the members of my town for anyone who will go to a house of mourning or a wedding (i.e. walk out for the purposes of a mitzvah).  And anyone who accepted it upon themselves that day is mutar (to leave the bounds).  If (they accept it) from when it darkens, they’re assur, for one doesn’t make an eruv after it darkens.
Bet: How much is its set measurement?  Food for two meals (suffices) for everyone.  Food for a weekday and not Shabbat according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, for Shabbat and not a weekday.  And each one is intending to be lenient (based on different views of how much is eaten at the respective meals).  Rabi Yochanan ben Broka says, a loaf of a pundyon, when four se’ah are (sold for) a sela.  Rabi Shimon says, two thirds of a loaf (which is made) three to a kav.  (The time needed to eat) half of it (a loaf that size) for (becoming fully tame in) a house of tzara’at.  And half of half of it (a quarter, must be eaten to) invalidate a body (from eating truma).
Gimmel: The people of a courtyard and the people of a balcony who forgot and didn’t make an eruv, anything higher than ten tfachim, is for (in the domain of) the balcony, less than that, for the courtyard.  The bank around a cistern or a rock, if they are taller than ten tfachim, it’s for the balcony, less than that, for the courtyard.  What is this talking about?  When they are close to each other, but when it is far (from the balcony), even if it is taller than ten tfachim, it’s for the courtyard.  What is considered close to?  Whatever isn’t farther than four tfachim.
Daled: One who puts his eruv in a gatehouse (for a watchman), patio, or balcony, it’s not an eruv, and the one who lives there does not prohibit him (from carrying in those areas).  (If he made an eruv in) a hay shed, a barn, a woodshed, or a storehouse, that is an eruv, and one who lives them can prohibit him.  Rabi Yehuda says, if the homeowner has a grasping of the hand (rights of possession) there, it doesn’t prohibit him.
Hay: One who left his house and went to spend Shabbat somewhere else, whether (he was) a non-Jew or a Jew, he prohibit according to Rabi Meir.  Rabi Yehuda says, he doesn’t prohibit.  Rabi Yossi says, a non-Jew prohibits, but a Jew does not prohibit, for the Jew cannot come there on Shabbat.  Rabi Shimon says, even if he left his house and went to spend Shabbat by his daughter in the same town, he doesn’t prohibit, for he already removed it from his heart (any intention to come to his house).
Vav: A cistern between two courtyards one may not fill from it on Shabbat, unless they made for it a divider taller than ten tfachim, whether above (the water), whether below, or whether in the basin.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, Beit Shamay says, below and Beit Hillel say above.  Rabi Yehuda said, the divider doesn’t have to be any bigger than the wall between them.
Zayin: A water channel which passes through a courtyard, one may not fill from it on Shabbat, unless they made dividers for it taller than ten tfachim at the beginning and end.  Rabi Yehuda says, a wall which is on it will be judged as a divider.  Rabi Yehuda said, there was once a channel of Avel from which they would fill with the approval of the elders on Shabbat.  They said to him, since it wasn’t the set measurement (and didn’t constitute a karmelit, an intermediary domain).
Chet: A balcony which (sticks out) over the water, one may not fill from it water, unless they made for it a divider taller than ten tfachim either above or below (the water).  And so too with two balconies one above the other.  If they made for the upper (balcony) and not the lower, both are assur until they make an eruv.
Tet: A courtyard which is less than four amot, one may not pour water into it on Shabbat, unless they made for it a pit which can hold two se’ah from the hole (made in the lip linking it to the public domain) downwards, whether outside or inside (in the public domain or not).  But if it’s outside, he has to cover it (so people won’t fall) but if it’s inside, he doesn’t have to cover it.
Yud: Rabi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says, a drain which is covered (for at least a length of) four amot in the public domain, one may pour water into it on Shabbat.  Chachamim say, even a roof or a courtyard (through which the drain passes are) of one hundred amot, he may not pour into a drain on Shabbat, but he may pour from roof to roof, and the water will fall into the drain.  A courtyard and a patio combine to form four amot.
Yud Aleph: So too two rows of two story buildings which face each other.  Some of them made pits and some didn’t make pits, those who made pits are allowed and those who didn’t make pits are forbidden.
