Aleph: One who hired workers and told them to come early or stay late, in a place where it is not the custom to come early or stay late, he cannot force them.  In a place where it is the custom to feed (the workers), he must feed, or (if it is the custom) to provide with sweet (things while they are working), he must provide, everything is like the custom of the country.  There was a case with Rabi Yochanan ben Matia who said to his son, go and hire workers for us.  He went and set for the food, and when he came to his father, my son, even if you made for them like the feast of Shlomo in his time, you did not fulfill your obligation with them, for they are the children of Avraham, Yitzchak, and Ya’akov.  Rather, before they start their work, go out and say to them, (you work for me) on condition that you do not have on me (a right for anything) other than bread and beans alone.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, he didn’t have to say, everything is like the custom of the country.
Bet: And these (workers) eat (from what they work with, with rights) from the torah, one who does with that which is connected to the ground at the time of the finishing of the work, and with separated from the ground even before the work is finished, and with something which was grown from the ground.  And these (are workers) who do not eat, one who does with that which is connected to the ground when it is not done with its work, with that which is separated from the ground from after the work is done, and with a thing which is not grown from the ground.
Gimmel: (He may eat) if he was doing with his hands but not with his feet, his feet but not his hands, even (if the work was) with his shoulder, behold this one eats.  Rabi Yossi bar Yehuda says, (he may not eat) until he does with his hands and feet (which is connected to the prohibition of muzzling an ox, which works with hands and feet, while threshing).
Daled: If e was doing with figs, he may not eat grapes; with grapes, he may not eat figs.  But he may stop himself until he gets to the place of the nice (best fruit) and eat.  And all of them they didn’t say (they could eat) other than the time of work.  But, because of returning lost objects to the owners they said, the workers may eat on their way from row to row, and when returning from the winepress, and a donkey (can eat until) when it is being unpacked.
Hay: A worker with squash may eat, even for (the value of) a dinar, and dates, even for a dinar.  Rabi Eliezer Chisma says, a worker may not eat more than his salary, and the Chachamim allow.  But they teach a person that he should not be a glutton and close the door (to more work) before himself.
Vav: A person can stipulate for himself (to get extra money and not eat), for his adult on and daughter, for his adult slave and maidservant, and for his wife, because they have knowledge (they will understand that they can’t eat), but he may not stipulate for his minor son and daughter, minor slave and maidservant, or for his animals, for they do not have knowledge.
Zayin: One who hires workers to do in his neta revai (four-year-old crop which must be eaten in Yerushalayim), behold these may not eat.  If he didn’t inform them, he redeems and feeds them.  If his cakes (of figs) crumbled of his barrels (of wine) opened, behold these he (a worker) may not eat (for they were most likely not tithed).  If he didn’t inform them, he take ma’aser and feeds them.
Chet: The guardians of produce may eat from the ways (customs) of the country, but not from the torah.  There are four guardians, an unpaid guardian, borrower, one who takes a salary (paid guardian) and renter.  An unpaid guardian swears (that he was not negligent) about everything (and is exempt from paying), the borrower pays for everything, and the one who takes a salary and the renter swear about something broken, something taken captive, and something which died, and pay for something lost and something stolen.
Tet: One wolf (which eats a sheep) is not forced (circumstances beyond one’s control which the unpaid guardian, paid guardian, and renter swear for), but two wolves are forced.  Rabi Yehuda says, in a time of a pack of wolves even (if the damage is caused by only) one wolf (the damage) is forced.  Two dogs are not forced.  Yadua the Bavli says in the name of Rabi Meir, from one direction it is not forced, from two directions, it is forced.  Bandits, behold this is forced.  The lion, the bear, the tiger, the panther, and the snake, behold this is forced.  When?  When they come from themselves (of their own accord) but if he led them (the animals in his charge) to a place with hordes of animals or bandits, this is not forced.
Yud: If it (an animal) died in its (normal) way, behold this is forced.  If he afflicted it (by not giving it proper care) and it died, it is not forced.  If it went up to the top of cliffs and it fell, behold this is forced.  If he brought it up to the top of cliffs and it fell and died, it is not forced.  An unpaid guardian may make a condition that he is exempt from swearing, the borrower to be exempt from paying, and the one who takes a salary and renter to be exempt from swearing and from paying.
Yud Aleph: All who make a condition about (against) what is written in the torah, his condition is null.  And any condition which has an action at its beginning the condition is null (the deed takes place even if the condition is not met).  And any that he can fulfill it eventually and he made a condition about it from the beginning (something that may happen after the deed and he stipulated that it occur after) his condition is valid (the deed is invalid if the condition is not fulfilled).
