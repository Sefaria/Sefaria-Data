Aleph: One who vows against herbs is mutar by gourds, and Rabi Akiva forbids.  They said to Rabi Akiva, and doesn’t a person say to his messenger, buy me herbs and he (the messenger) says, I didn’t find except gourds?  He said to this, it is indeed so.  Would he perhaps say to him, I didn’t find except legumes?  Rather gourds are included in herbs, and legumes are not included in herbs.  And he is assur by moist Egyptian bean and mutar by dry.
