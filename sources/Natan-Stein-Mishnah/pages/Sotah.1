Aleph: One who warns his wife (not to be alone with a certain man, and if she is she becomes a sota, or suspected of adultery), Rabi Eliezer says, he warns her before two (witnesses) and he makes her drink (the sota water, which will curse her if she did commit adultery) on the mouth (testimony) of one (who says he saw her seclude herself with the man) or himself.  Rabi Yehoshua says, he warns her before two and makes her drink before two.
Bet: How does he warn her?  He says to her before two, do not speak with so-and-so, and she spoke with him, she is still mutar to her house (husband) and mutar to eat truma (if she is married to a kohen, while a sota she may not eat truma).  If she goes in with him to a secluded place, and she waited with him enough (time) to become tame (defiled), she is assur to her house and to eat truma.  And if he (her husband) died, she gets chalitza and not yibum.
Gimmel: And these are assur from eating truma, one who says, I am tame to you; witnesses came and said she was tame; one who says, I will not drink (the sota waters); one that the husband does not wish to make drink; and one who had sex with her on the way (to have her drink after she was warned and secluded herself).How does he do to (act towards) her?  He brings her to the court which is in that place, and they give him two scholars, for perhaps he will have sex with her on the way.  Rabi Yehuda says, her husband is trusted with her.
Daled: They would bring he to the great court in Yerushalayim (when she was going to drink) and intimidate her the way they intimidate the witnesses for a capital case, and tell her, my daughter, wine does much (causes sin), levity makes much, childlessness makes much (immorality), and bad neighbors make a lot, do for His great name which is written in holiness (confess instead of going through with this), so that it is not erased on the water (the name of Hashem is written on a piece of parchment and erased in water to make the sota water).  And they say before her things that she and all of her family, her father’s house, do not deserve to hear (things about precedent for confession).
Hay: If she said, I am tame, she breaks her ktuba (forfeits all rights to it) and goes (there are no witnesses, so she is not put to death).  And if she said, I am tahor, they bring her up to the eastern gate which faces the entrance of the Nikanor gate, for there they give drink to the sotot, make the yoldot (those who have just given birth) tahor, and make the metzora’im tahor.  The kohen would grab her clothes, if they rip, they rip and if they are tattered, they are tattered (he need not worry about ruining her clothes), until he uncovers her heart (bosom) and undoes her hair (all to embarrass her into confessing).  Rabi Yehuda says, if her heart was beautiful, he would not uncover it, and if her hair was nice, he would not undo it.
Vav: If she was wearing white, he would clothe her in black.  If she had on her gold jewelry, chains, nose-rings, and rings, they take them off of her in order to embarrass her.  And then he brings an Egyptian rope (of palm leaves) over her breasts (so her clothing will stay up).  And all who want to see her come and see, except for her slaves and maidservants, because she is familiar with them (which would make her more likely to continue pleading innocence).  And all women are allowed to see her, as it says, “and all the women will be taught and they will not do like her lewdness.”
Zayin: With the measure a person measures, with it they measure for him (judgment from Hashem comes exactly according to what a person deserves).  She decorated herself with sin, Hashem embarrassed her.  She revealed herself for sin, Hashem reveled on her (for anyone could come and see her).  With her thigh she started the sin, and after that the stomach, therefore she will be punished with the thigh first and then the stomach.  And the rest of the body does not escape.
Chet: Shimshon went after his eyes, therefore the Plishtim gouged out his eyes, as it says, “and the Plishtim grabbed him and gouged out his eyes.”  Avshalom had pride from his hair, therefore he was hung by his hair.  And because he had sex with ten concubines of his father, ten spears were thrust into him, as it says, “and ten people, bearers of the vessels (weapons) of Yo’av, encircled him.” And because he stole three hearts (deceived), his father’s heart, the heat of the court, and the hear of yisra’el, as it says, “and Avshalom stole the heart of the people of Israel,” therefore three darts were thrust into him, as it says, “and he took three darts in his hand and he thrust them into the heart of Avshalom.”
Tet: And so too for the issue of good.  Miriam waited for Moshe one hour, as it says, “and his sister guarded from afar,” therefore yisra’el waited for her seven days in the desert, as it says, “and the nation did not travel until Miriam was collected back.”  Yosef merited to bury his father, and there was not one of his brothers greater than him, as it is written, “and Yosef went up to bury his father… and went up with him also chariots also horsemen.”  Who is greater than Yosef, for none other than Moshe dealt with him (his burial).  Moshe merited in the bones of Yosef, and there is not greater than him in yisra’el, as is says, “and Moshe took the bones of Yosef with him.”  Who is greater than Moshe, for none other than Hashem dealt with him, as it says, “and He buried him in the valley.”  Not on Moshe alone did they say this, rather on all of the righteous, as it says, “and your righteousness shall go before you and the glory of Hashem will gather you in.”
