Aleph: A simple get (divorce document) its witnesses (sign) within it, and a tied one (which is sewn in folds), its witnesses are on the back.  A simple one that its witnesses wrote on the back or a tied one that its witnesses wrote in it, they are both invalid.  Rabi Chanania ben Gamliel says, a tied one that its witnesses wrote in it is valid, because he can make it simple (by untying it).  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, all is according to the custom of the district.
Bet: A simple get, its witnesses are two, and a tied, three.  A simple in which one witness is written, and a tied in which two are written, they are both invalid.  If he wore in it (a loan document that he loaned) one hundred zuz which are twenty sela (they are really twenty-five), hedoesn’t have (a right to collect) other than twenty (sela).  (If he wrote) one hundred zuz which are thirty sela, he does not have other than a maneh (on hundred zuz).  (If he wrote) silver zuzim which are, and it (the number) was erased, it is not less than two.  Silver sela’im which are, and it is erased, it is not less than two.  Darics (a gold coin) which are, and it was erased, it is not less than two.  If it is written on it above (at the top of the document) a maneh and below (at the bottom) two hundred (zuz) or above two hundred and below a maneh, all goes after the bottom.  If so, why do they write the top?  So that is one letter of the bottom is erased  he will learn (the amount) from the top.
Gimmel: One writes a get for a man even if his wife is not with him, and a receipt (which is given to the husband upon receiving a get) for a woman even if her husband is not with her, as long as they (the scribe and witnesses) know them (the couple).  And the husband gives the wage (for writing the documents).  One writes a document (of sale) for the sale even if the buyer is not with him, but they do not write for the buyer until the seller is with him.  And the buyer gives the wage.
Daled: One does not write documents of engagement or marriage except with the knowledge of both of them.  And the groom gives the wage.  One does not write documents of tenantry and receiving (as a rental) except with the knowledge of both of them.  And the receiver gives the wage.  One does not write documents of arbitration or any action of a court except for with the knowledge of both of them (both parties).  And they both give the wage.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, they both write two, for this (a copy) for himself and for that for himself.
Hay: One who paid part of his loan and (gave) his deed to a third party (to keep track of the outstanding debt), and he (the borrower) said to him (the third party), if I don’t give him (the rest) from here until such-and-such a day, he will give (undoing the paid part).  Rabi Yehuda says, he does not give.
Vav: One whose loan document was erased, witnesses testify about it, he comes to court, and they make a fulfillment for him (by saying), the man so-and-so, his document was erased on such-and-such a day, and so-and-so and so-and-so are his witnesses.  One who paid part of his loan Rabi Yehuda says, he will change (his old document for a new one.  Rabi Yossi says, he (the lender will right a receipt.  Rabi Yehuda says, we find this one must guard his receipt from mice (for without the receipt the full amount of the loan is valid).  Rabi Yossi said to him, this is good for him (proper for the borrower), and it does not reduce the power of that (the lender, for writing a new date means he will not have rights to property sold before that date which he would have with the original date).
Zayin: Two brothers, one poor and one rich, and their father left them a bathhouse and olive press.  If the made (improved) them for the wage, the wage if for the middle (to be split), if they made them for themselves.  Behold the rich can say to the poor, buy slaves for yourself and they can come and wash in the bathhouse, or, buy yourself olives and come and press in the olive press (allowing him use them, but preventing him from renting them out, effectively forcing him to sell his rights).  There were two in one city, the name of one was Yosef ben Shimon and the name of the other was Yosef ben Shimon.  They cannot take out a loan document on each other, and another cannot take a loan document on them.  If one found between his documents the document of Yosef ben Shimon which was paid, the bills of both of them are paid.  What will they do?  They will write three generations.  And if they were (the same to) three generations, they will write a sign (a description of them).  And if they have the same sign, they shall write kohen.  One who says to his son, there is a document among my documents which is paid, but I don’t know which, all of the documents are paid.  If they found for one (person) two (loan documents) there, the larger is paid and the smaller is not paid.  One who lends his friends at the hands of a guarantor, he may not collect from the third party, but if he said, on condition that I will collect from whoever I want, he may collect from the guarantor.  Raban Shimon ben Gamliel says, if the borrower has property, either way he may not collect from the guarantor.  And so too Raban Shimon ben Gamliel would say, a guarantor for a woman on her ktuba, and her husband was divorcing her, he (the guarantor) makes him (the husband) swear (against deriving) pleasure from her, for perhaps they conspired against that one’s property and he will return his wife.
Chet: One who lends his friend with a document collects from (even) mortgaged property.  (If he lent) with witnesses (but not a document), he collects from free (unmortgaged) property.  If he took out his handwriting on him (proving the loan), he takes from free property.  A guarantor who came out after the signing of the documents (was not known of during the signing) he (le lender) collects from free property (of the guarantor).  A case came before Rabi Yishma’el and he said, he collects from free property.  Ben Nanas said to him, he does not collect not from mortgaged property and not from free property.  He said to him, why?  He said to him, behold one who strangles one (violently grabs a borrower) in the shuk, and his (the borrower’s) friend found him and said to him (the lender), leave him, he’s patur, for he did not lend him with his faith (he did not trust the third while lending, but only found him after).  Rabi Yishma’el said, one who wants to be smart will deal in the laws of money, for there is no profession in the torah greater than them, fore they are like a spring sending forth.  And one who wants to deal with the laws of money, let him serve (shadow) Shimon ben Nanas.
