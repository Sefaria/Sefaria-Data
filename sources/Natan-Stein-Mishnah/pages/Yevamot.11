Aleph: One may marry (the relatives of) a woman (who he) raped or seduced.  One who rapes or seduces a married woman is chayav (to punishment based on the situation).  One may marry a woman his father raped or seduced or (a woman) his son raped or seduced.  Rabi Yehuda prohibits (a woman) his father raped or seduced (for one may not take a woman his father has slept with).
Bet: A convert whose sons converted with her, they do not do chalitza or yibum (for they are not related by the father) even if the first one (son) was not conceived in kdusha (while she was not Jewish) and born in kdusha (after she converted) and the second one was conceived and born in kdusha.  So too the sons of a maidservant whose sons were released with her.
Gimmel: Five women whose children were mixed up, the mixed up children grew up, married women, and died.  Four (out of the five’s brothers, none of whom were mixed up) do chalitza for one, and one does yibum for her.  He and three others do chalitza for another (wife) and another, and one does yibum for her (etc).  We find four chalitzot and a yibum for each.
Daled: A woman whose child was mixed up with that of her daughter-in-law, the mixed up children grew up, married women, and died.  The children of the daughter-in-law do not do chalitza or yibum, for they are a doubt of the wife of his brother or the wife of the wife of his father’s brother, and the sons of the older (the grandmother) either do chalitza or yibum, for it is a doubt of the wife of his brother or the wife of the son of his brother.  If the valid ones died, the sons of those mixed up for (the wives of) the sons of the older do chalitza but not yibum, for it is a doubt of the wife of his brother or the wife of the brother of his father, and (for the wives of) the sons on the daughter-in-law) they may either do chalitza or yibum.
Hay: A kohenet whose child was mixed up with her maidservant’s, behold these eat truma, take a portion from the threshing floor (finished agricultural products as truma), may not become tame for the dead, and do not marry women whether valid (because they me be a slave) or invalid (since they may be a kohen).  When the mixed up grow up, they free each other and marry women valid for kohanim and do not become tame for the dead, but if they do not get lashes.  They do not eat truma, but if they do, they do not pay principal plus a fifth.  They do not get a portion from the threshing floor, (and if they did) they sell the truma and the money is theirs.  They do not get a portion of the holy things of the Beit hamikdash, they do not give them holy foods, they do not take their things (which would be given to a kohen) out of their hands, and they are patur from the shank bone, the cheeks, and the maw (parts of an offering given to a kohen), their firstborn animals are put out to pasture until they become blemished, and they put upon them the stringencies of kohanim and the stringencies of yisra’elim.
Vav: A woman who did not wait three months after her husband (divorced her or died), married, and gave birth, and it’s not known whether it was a nine month old for the first or a seven month old for the second, and she has sons from the first and the second, they do chalitza (if the doubtful brother dies) but not yibum.  And so too he does chalitza and not yibum.  If he had brothers from the first and brothers from the second who aren’t from the same mother, he does chalitza or yibum, and them, one does chalitza and one does yibum.
Zayin: If one was a yisra’el and one was a kohen, he marries a woman fit for a kohen; does not become tame for the dead, and if he became tame he does not get lashes; he does not eat truma, and if he did he does not pay principal and chomesh; he does not get a portion from the threshing floor, and (if he did) he sells the truma and the money is his; he does not get a portion of the holy things of the Beit hamikdash; they do not give them holy foods; they do not his things out of his hands, and he are patur from the shank bone, the cheeks, and the maw; his firstborn animals are put out to pasture until they become blemished; and they put upon him the stringencies of kohanim and the stringencies of yisra’elim.  If they (the possible fathers) were both kohanim, he grieves for them and they grieve for him, he does not become tame for them and they do not become tame for him, and he does not inherit from them but they inherit from him.  And he is patur on hitting and cursing either one.  He goes up for the watch of either one but he does not take a share.  If they were both in one watch, he takes one portion.
