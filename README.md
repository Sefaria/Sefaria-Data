Sefaria-Data
============

This repo contains source data, parsing scripts, data files and logs for data projects going into [Sefaria](http://www.sefaria.org). This is the messy input that is processed to become the Sefaria Library.

If you're looking to download Sefaria's texts or links, please see [Sefaria-Export](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Export). Exported data has a uniform structure.

For Sefaria source code see [Sefaria-Project](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project).
