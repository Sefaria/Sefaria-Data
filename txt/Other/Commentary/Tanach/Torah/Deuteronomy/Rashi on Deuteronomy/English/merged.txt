Chapter 1



Verse 1

Because these are words of admonishment, and [because] he [Moshe] intended to recount here all the places where they [the Israelites] angered the Almighty, he therefore said these words in an obscure manner and only intimated [that they sinned in these places] to uphold the honor of Israel.

Verse 8


[This implies that] there is no one objecting to the matter, so you do not need to go to war in order to take possession of the land. Had they [the nation] not sent spies, they would not have needed weapons [to conquer the land]. 

Verse 9

"And I spoke unto you at that time, saying" - What is [the meaning of] 'saying'? Moses said to them, "I am not speaking to you by myself, rather from the mouth of the of the Holy One Blessed is He."

You made me weak like a female, for I was worried over you, and you weakened my hand. For I saw that you no longer yearned to come close [to G-d], with love. Would it not have been better to learn direct from the Almighty rather than myself?

... " To follow in all of His ways"- He is merciful and you should be merciful, He performs acts of kindness and you should perform acts of kindness
..."And to cling to Him"- Is it possible to say thus? But is He not a consuming fire? Rather cling to Torah scholars and I will consider it about you as if you attached yourself to Him

Verse 4

But further on it says,“For there will never cease to be needy [within the land]” (verse 11). [These two verses seem to contradict each other. However, the explanation is:] When you perform the will of the Omnipresent, there will be needy among others but not among you. If, however, you do not perform the will of the Omnipresent, there will be needy among you. - [Sifrei]
Needy: Heb. אֶבְיוֹן, [denoting someone who is] poorer than an ע ָנִי. The term אֶבְיוֹן means“to yearn for” (תָּאֵב) , i.e., one who yearns for everything [because he has nothing]. — [Vayikra Rabbah 34:6]

Verse 11

You may take her as your wife: The Torah speaks only in deference to the wicked inclination, for if God would not permit her [to him], he would take her illicitly. However, if he does marry her, he will ultimately come to hate her, as it says afterwards, "If a man has [two wives]" and ultimately he will father from her a wayward rebellious son. This is why these topics are placed one after the other.

Verse 1

"If she does not find favor in his eyes"-
It is a positive commandment ('Mitzva") for him to divorce her (by means of a written 'get') if she does not find favor in his eyes.
