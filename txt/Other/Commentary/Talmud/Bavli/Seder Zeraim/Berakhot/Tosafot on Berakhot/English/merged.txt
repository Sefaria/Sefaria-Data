Daf 1a



Daf 1b



Daf 2a



Line 1

<b>From when may one recite ...</b> - Rashi explained: "and how can we recite [in the evening] when it still day, and we don't wait until the stars come out, as is made explicit in the Gemara? ", and therefore Rashi  explained that that the bedside recitation of Shema is the main [recitation], which is after the stars come out. And thus in the Jerusalem Talmud: "And if he recites before then, he has not fulfilled, and if so, why do we pray the Recitation of the Shema in the synagogue? In order to stand for Prayer [i.e., the Amidah] from within words of Torah. [until here - Rashi's question and answer]. But his explanation is surprising, for, behold, the world is only accustomed to reciting before laying down [to sleep] the first passage (Berakhot 60b), and if so, one should read [all] three passages. And further, that bedside recitation of Shema is only due to the evil spirits, as it says in the adjoining [section] (Berakhot 5a): "If he is a wise student, he doesn't need [to recite the bedtime Shema]". And another difficulty: If this is true, then we rule like R. Yehoshua ben Levi, who said, "They ordained the prayers [i.e., amidah recitations] in the middle", meaning, between the recitation of Shema of morning and the recitation of Shema of evening, yet we hold like R. Yochanan, who said (Berakhot 4b): "Who is assured the World to Come? One who juxtaposes Redemption [i.e., the Emet Ve'Emunah blessing, which ends "the One who redeemed Israel"] to Prayer. Therefore Rabbeynu Tam explained that the recitation of synagogue is the main [recitation]. And if you would say, how can we recite when it still broad daylight? It is possible to say [in response]: we hold like Rabbi Yehudah, who said in Chapter <i>Tefilat HaShachar</i> (Berakhot 26a) that the time for the afternoon  prayer is until <i>plag haminchah</i>, that is, until 10 3/4 hours [from sunrise; 1 1/4 hours before sunset], and immediately when the time for the afternoon prayer ends, the time for the evening prayer begins. And if you would say, how then do we pray the afternoon prayer close to dark, even after <i>plag haminchah</i>? It is possible to say [in response]: that we hold like the Sages, who said, "the time for the afternoon prayer is until evening", and we say further on (Berakhot 27a): Now that the halachic ruling has not been stated like either master [i.e., Rabbi Yehudah or the Sages] - whoever does according to either master has done [well]." But nevertheless, there is a difficulty, for this is like two voices that tear down each other! For behold, for what reason do we pray the evening prayer immediately after <i>plag haminchah</i>? Because we hold that hold that the <i>minchah</i> hour ends according to Rabbi Yehudah, and immediately afterwards it's time for the evening prayer. Yet regarding the time for the [afternoon] prayer itself, we don't hold like Rabbi Yehudah but rather like the Sages! Therefore, Rabbeynu Yitzchak says, it's certainly [the case] that the recitation of Shema of the synagogue is the main [recitation], and we who pray the evening prayer while it is still day, hold like those <i>Tanna'im</i> of  the <i>Gemara</i> who said that from when the day is sanctified and also from when people enter to dine, that is, the Shabbat evening meal, which was while it was still day - from that time on it is time for the [evening] prayer. And there is also proof, for Rav used to prayer the Shabbat [evening] prayer on the eve of Shabbat [i.e., Friday afternoon], and presumably he also recited the recitation of Shema. From all of these proofs, is is apparent that the recitation of Shema of the synagogue is the main [recitation]. Now regarding that which is stated in the Jerusalem [Talmud]: "Why do they recite in synagogue..." - Rabbeynu Tam says: They were accustomed to reciting the Shema before their prayers, like we are accustomed to saying <i>Ashrei</i> beforehand - that recitation of Shema is merely to order to stand for Prayer [i.e., the Amidah] from within words of Torah. And hence, it seems that one who recites the bedside recitation of Shema should not bless, and also, he need not recite more than the first passage.

Let it teach that [recitation] of <i>Shacharit</i> first– as we find regarding the <i>Tamid</i> [offering], where [the offering] of morning is written first.

If so, the latter [mishnah], where it teaches [the <i>berachot</i> of the Shema of] <i>Shacharit</i> first – it would be fine if you say that it leans on the Scriptural passage of <i>b’shokh’bkah</i>, for if so, Scripture is only particular about the recitation of Shema, but if you say that it leans on the Scriptural passage of the Creation of the World, if so, it is particular regarding all things [including the <i>berachot</i> of Shema], so then the latter [mishnah], where it is teaching etc…

Line 23

He blesses two before it [the recitation of Shema], etc – (Yerushalmi) and the seven blessings [in total which surround the recitation of Shema morning and evening] are correlated with [the verse] “Seven [times] a day do I praised You” (Psalms 119), and <i>yir’u eineinu</i> is not counted, for this blessing was ordained by the Sages in order to [cause people] to wait at the synagogue for their fellows [to finish praying]. This is specificially regarding their [i.e., the Babylonian] synagogues, for they were in the fields and they were dangerous due to the malevolent spirits, but in our synagogues we only need to wait for our fellows [to finish praying] at night.

And this is what it is teaching us: that atonement does not impede – and if you should say: this has already been taught once in Tractate <i>Nega’im</i> (Mishna Negaim 14), and it is brought in <i>HaArel</i> (Yevamot 74b): Once his sun sets, he may eat of <i>terumah</i> - - it can be said [in response]: it is common for mishnayot to inform us briefly even regarding something which has been made explicit already.

Daf 2b



Line 1

Perhaps it’s the coming of his light  - Rashi explains – until the light of the eighth day shines, and what is <i>v’taher</i> “and he is pure” – the person is pure –that the person becomes [fully] purified upon bringing his sacrifices. But, [according] to his commentary, it is surprising, for let [them] raise this difficulty on that [passage] in <i>&gt;HeArel&gt;</i> Yebamoth 74b regarding: when his sun sets he may eat <i>terumah</i>, etc. – from where do we know that it is the setting of his sun?! And further: how is it possible to say that it’s dealing with sunrise – for if it were dealing with sunrise then it should have written in Scripture “and the sun will rise (<i>v’zarach</i>) and he is pure”, like “from the rising (<i>mizrach</i>) of the sun” (Numbers 21), or using the language of going out (<i>yetzi’ah<i>) like “the sun went out <i>yatza’</i>) upon the land” (Genesis 19) yet Scripture employed “the sun came” – this implies that it is the setting of the sun! And further, in the adjoining passage it inquires: this “and the sun comes” – is it the coming in of its light?... – which it resolves from the <i>baraita</i> “an indication of the matter etc..” – let it resolve it from the Mishnah (Nega’im 14): when his sun sets, he may eat from <i>terumah</i> - implying that [our term refers to] sunset! But one can answer that this is its interpretation: From where is it that this “the sun comes and he is pure” is actual sunset, and that “he is pure” – the day is pure – namely, stars-out; perhaps it is the coming of his light, that is, the beginning of the setting of the sun, which is the beginning of its being gathered in in the firmament, yet there remains in the day a period of five miles [walk] until star’s out, and what is “and he is pure” – the man is pure – now our mishnah in <i>ha’arel</i> is not difficult at all, for it is possible to say that the term <i>he’eriv shimsho</i> over there refers to the coming-in of his light, so that even from there you wouldn't [be able] to simply conclude that it is equivalent to stars out, and for that reason it needs to bring here the <i>baraita</i> [which mentions explicitly] stars out.</i></i>
