Chapter 1

The [fobidden] transfers [of domain] on Shabbat are two, which are [really] four, [from] inside, and two, which are [really] four, [from] outside.  How is this?  [Assuming] a poor person stands outside, and the owner of the building [stands] inside:  [If] the poor person reached his hand inside, and put [something] into the hand of the owner of the building; or took [something] from it and brought it outside; the poor person is liable, and the owner of the building is exempt.  [If] the owner of the building reached his hand outside, and put [something] into the hand of the poor person; or took [something] from it and brought it inside; the owner of the building is liable, and the poor person is exempt.  [If] the poor person reached his hand inside, and the owner of the building took [something] from it; or put [something] into it, and [the poor person] brought it outside; they are both exempt.  [If] the owner of the building reached his hand outside, and the poor person took [something] from it; or put [something] into it, and [the owner of the building] brought it inside; they are both exempt.
A man may not sit before the barber close to [the time of] mincha, And may not enter either a bath-house, a tannery, [or enter] to eat, or for judgment [in court].' But if [people] began, they do not [need to] interrupt. We interrupt for the recitation of Shema, but we do not interrupt for prayers.
The tailor may not go out with his needle close to nightfall, [for] perhaps he will forget and go out [on Shabbat]; and neither [may] the scribe [go out] with his quill.  One may not delouse his apparel, and may not read by lamp-light.  In truth, the lector may see where the youngsters are reading, but he may not read.  Similarly, A man who experienced a flow may not eat with a woman who experienced a flow, because of habitual sin.
And these are some of the regulations enacted in the attic of Hananiah b. Hyzkiyah b. Gorion, when the rabbis came to visit him. They called the roll and found that the disciples of Shamai were more numerous than those of Hillel, and they enforced eighteen regulations on that day.
The Beth Shamai said: Ink, dye material, or fodder (for animals) shall not be put into water (on Friday) unless there is still time for them to soak through while it is day. The Beth Hillel, however, permits this.
Bet Shammai says, One may not put bundles of flax into the oven, unless they will be steamed during the day; nor wool into the kettle, unless it will absorb the appearance. But Bet Hillel permits it. Bet Shammai says, One may not spread nets for animals, birds or fish, unless they ensnare during the day; Bet Hillel permits.
Beth Shammai declared it unlawful to sell any thing to a heathen [on the Sabbath-eve], or to help him to load, or to load for him, unless there be time sufficient for him to reach a neighbouring town [or village] during the day [before the Sabbath comes in] : but Beth Hillel permit it.
Beth Shammai declare it unlawful to deliver skins to a heathen tanner, or clothes to a heathen laundress [on the Sabbathevej, unless there be time enough for them to be got ready during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]: all of this Beth Hillel permit to be done, while the sun remains above the horizon.
Rabban Shimon Ben Gamliel said: "It was the custom in my father's house, to deliver white garments to the heathen laundress three days before Sabbath." [Both schools] agree, that it is permitted to put blocks on the oil-press, and the round logs on the wine-press near the coming in of the Sabbath].
Neither meat, onions, nor eggs, must be fried [on the Sabbath-eve], unless there be time sufficient for them to get quite done during the day [before the Sabbath comes in]. Bread must not be put into the oven towards dusk [nightfall] on the Sabbath-eve, nor cakes on the coals, unless there be time enough for the surface to become crusted during the day [before the Sabbath comes in], R. Eleazar saith [unless there be time sufficient for] the bottom to become crusted.
It is permitted to put the paschal offering into the oven towards dusk on the Sabbath-eve. And the priests [in the Temple] may stir the fire a little in the hearth-room, but in other halls [of the Temple] only if there is time sufficient for the fire to seize on the greater part of the wood. R. Jehudah saith of coals, "if any part of them be ignited [before the Sabbath come in]."
