Chapter 1

The [types of] oaths are two, which are [really] four; The [types of] [sin involving] recognitions of impurity are two, which are [really] four; The [types of] [forbidden] transfers of domain on Shabbat are two, which are [really] four; The [types of] appearances of lesions [of tzaraat] are two, which are [really] four.
Any [sin while impure] that has recognition at the beginning, and recognition at the end, and unawareness in between – this is [atoned for] by a variable sin-offering.  If it has recognition at the beginning, and no recognition at the end – the he-goat which [has its blood service] performed Inside and the Day of Atonement defer it; until it becomes known to him, and he brings a variable sin-offering.
[If] [a sin while impure] has no recognition at the beginning, but has recognition at the end – The he-goat which [has its blood service] performed Outside and the Day of Atonement atone [for this sin];  As it states, "Aside from the sin-offering of Atonement" (Numbers 29:11) – for that which this one atones, that one atones. Just as the Inside one only atones for a matter which has [a period of] recognition, so the Outside one only atones for a matter which has [a period of] recognition.
For [a sin while impure] that has no recognition either at the beginning or at the end – the he-goats of the Pilgrimage Festivals and the he-goats of the New Months atone; these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Shimon says: The he-goats of the Pilgrimage Festivals atone [for it], but not the he-goats of the Pilgrimage Festivals. And for what do the he-goats of the New Months atone? For a pure person who ate an impure [food] item. Rabi Meir says: All the he-goats have equivalent atonements, for the impurity of the Temple and its sacred objects.  For Rabbi Shimon would say: The he-goats of the New Months atone for a pure person that ate an impure [food] item, and those of the Pilgrimage Festivals atone for that which has no recognition either at the beginning or at the end, and those of the Day of Atonement atone for that which has no recognition at the beginning, but has recognition at the end.  [The rabbis] said to him: What is [the law as to] whether they may be offered one for the other? He said to them: They may be offered. They said to him: Since their atonements are not equivalent, how can they be offered [one for the other]? He said to them: They all come to atone for the impurity of the Temple and its sacred objects.
Rabbi Shimon ben Yehudah says in his own name:  The he-goats of the New Months atone for a pure person who ate an impure [food] item;  Those of the Pilgrimage Festivals include more than them, for they atone for a pure person who ate an impure [food] item, and for [a sin while impure] that has no recognition either at the beginning or at the end;  That of the Day of Atonement includes more than them, for it atones for a pure person who ate an impure [food] item, and for [a sin while impure] that has no recognition either at the beginning or at the end, and for [a sin while impure] that has no recognition at the beginning, but has recognition at the end;  [The rabbis] said to him: He would say that they can be offered one for the other. He said to them: Yes. They said to him: If so, let those [he-goats] of the Day of Atonement be offered on the New Months, but how can those of the New Months be offered on the Day of Atonement to atone for that which is not theirs? He said to them: They all come to atone for the impurity of the Temple and its sacred objects.
For an intentional sin involving the impurity of the Temple and its sacred objects, the he-goat which [has its blood service] performed Inside and the Day of Atonement atone;  For the other transgressions in the Torah – minor ones and major ones, intentional ones and unintentional ones, where one found out [about it] [later] or did not find out, a positive commandment or a negative commandment, ones [punishable by] excision and ones [punishable by] capital punishment – the Sent He-goat atones.
It is the same for an Israel, for the Priests, and for the Anointed Priest. And what is the difference between an Israel, the Priests and the Anointed Priest? Only that the blood [service] of the bull atones for the Priests for [their sins involving] the impurity of the Temple and its sacred objects.  Rabbi Shimon says: Just as the blood [service] of the he-goat which [has its blood service] performed Inside atones for all Israel, so the blood [service] of the bull atones for the Priests. Just as the confessions of the Sent He-goat atone for Israel, so the confessions of the bull atone for the Priests.
