Chapter 1

Five [types of people] may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> [produce consecrated for priestly consumption], and if they did set aside <i>Terumah</i>, their <i>Terumah</i> is not [valid] <i>Terumah</i>: the deaf person, and the fool, and the minor, and one who sets aside <i>Terumah</i> from what does not belong to him. A non-Jew who set aside <i>Terumah</i> from what belongs to a Jew even with permission, his <i>Terumah</i> is not [valid] <i>Terumah</i>. 
A deaf person who can speak but cannot hear may not set aside <i>Terumah</i>. But if he did set aside <i>Terumah</i>, his <i>Terumah</i> is valid <i>Terumah</i>. A deaf person that the Sages refer to in all cases can neither hear nor speak.
Regarding a minor who has not brought forth two [pubic] hairs, Rabbi Yehudah says that his <i>Terumah</i> is [valid] <i>Terumah</i>. Rabbi Yosi says, if he has not reached an age of [responsibility for his] vows, his <i>Terumah</i> is not [valid] <i>Terumah</i>. When he reaches an age [of responsibility for his] vows, his <i>Terumah</i> is [valid] <i>Terumah</i>. 
One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> from olives for oil, and not from grapes for wine. If you did set aside <i>Terumah</i> [from olives for oil or grapes for wine], the school of Shammai rules that their own <i>Terumah</i> [that was required of the grapes or wine] is among them, and the school of Hillel rules that their <i>Terumah</i> is not [valid] <i>Terumah</i>.
One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> from the <i>Leket</i> [fallen gleanings given to the poor], or from the <i>Shikhecha</i> [forgotten sheaves given to the poor], or from the <i>Pe'ah</i> [corner of the field that must be given to the poor], or from the <i>Hefker</i> [ownerless], and not from the first tithe whose <i>Terumah</i> has already been taken, or from <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem] or <i>Hekdesh</i> [consecrated donation] that has been redeemed, and not from that which is obligated [in <i>Terumah</i>] for that which is not obligated, and not from that which is not obligated to that which is obligated, and not from the picked to the unpicked, and not from the unpicked to the picked, and not from the <i>Chadash</i> [grain from the current year that one is forbidden to eat] for the <i>Yashan</i> [grain from the previous year that one is permitted to eat], and not from the <i>Yashan</i> for the <i>Chadash</i>, and not from the fruits of the Land [of Israel] for fruits from outside the Land, and not from fruits outside the Land for fruits of the Land. And if one did set aside <i>Terumah</i> [from these types of produce], their <i>Terumah</i> is not [valid] <i>Terumah</i>.
Five [types of people] may not set aside <i>Terumah</i>, and if they did set aside <i>Terumah</i>, their <i>Terumah</i> is not [valid] <i>Terumah</i>: the mute, the drunkard, the naked, the blind, and a <i>Ba'al Keri</i> [one who had a nocturnal emission] may not set aside <i>Terumah</i>, and if they did set aside <i>Terumah</i>, their <i>Terumah</i> is [valid] <i>Terumah</i>.
One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> by measure, by weights, or by number. However, one may set aside <i>Terumah</i> from that which has been measured, weighed, or counted. One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> in a basket or container with a known measure. However, one may set aside <i>Terumah</i> in them [by only filling them] a half or a third. One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> in [a container that holds one] <i>Seah</i> [specific unit of volume, by only filling it] a half, since half of it is a measure.
One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> from oil for crushed olives, nor from wine for trodden grapes. If one has already set aside <i>Terumah</i>, his <i>Terumah</i> is [valid] <i>Terumah</i>, but he must again set aside <i>Terumah</i>. The first [set of <i>Terumah</i>] will render on its own [another substance that it falls into] <i>Demai</i> [produce from which it is uncertain if tithes are already taken] and requires a fine of a fifth [of its value if eaten by an Israelite], but not so with the second [set of <i>Terumah</i>].
One may set aside <i>Terumah</i> from oil for pickled olives, and wine for grapes that will be made into raisins. Behold, if one set aside <i>Terumah</i> from oil for olives that will be eaten, or wine for grapes that will be eaten, or grapes for grapes that will be eaten, and he decided to press them, he does not need to set aside <i>Terumah</i> [again].
One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> from substances whose preparations have been finished for substances whose preparations have not been finished, and not from substances whose preparations have not been finished for substances whose preparations have been finished, and not from substances whose preparations have not been finished for [other] substances whose preparations have not been finished. But if they have already set aside <i>Terumah</i>, their <i>Terumah</i> is [valid] <i>Terumah</i>.

Chapter 2

One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> [produce set aside for priestly consumption] from the pure for the impure. And if they set the <i>Terumah</i> aside, their <i>Terumah</i> is [valid] <i>Terumah</i>. Truly they said, the fig round, some of which has been made impure, one may set aside <i>Terumah</i> from the pure that is in it for the impure that is in it. And so too with a bundle of greenery, and so too with a pile. If there were two rounds, two bundles, or two piles--one impure and one pure--one may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> from one for the other. Rabbi Eliezer says: one may set aside <i>Terumah</i> from the pure for the impure.
One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> from the impure for the pure. And if he accidentally set the <i>Terumah</i> aside, their <i>Terumah</i> is [valid] <i>Terumah</i>. If intentionally, [it is as if] he has done nothing. And so too with a Levite who had tithes from which <i>Terumah</i> had not been taken, and was continuously designating [parts of these impure tithes as the <i>Terumah</i> of other tithes]: if accidentally, what he did is done [with validity]. If intentionally, [it is as if] he has done nothing. Rabbi Yehudah said, if he knew that it was [impure] in the beginning, even if he [forgot and designated] accidentally, [it is as if] he has done nothing.
One who immerses vessels on the Sabbath accidentally may use them. Intentionally - he may not use them. One who tithes or cooks on the Sabbath accidentally may eat of it. Intentionally - he may not eat of it. One who plants on the Sabbath accidentally may allow it to grow. Intentionally - he must uproot [the plant]. If it is during the Sabbatical year, whether it was accidental or intentional - he must uproot.
One may not set aside <i>Terumah</i> from one species for a different species. And if he set the <i>Terumah</i> aside, his <i>Terumah</i> is not [valid] <i>Terumah</i>. All species of wheat are [considered] one [species]. All species of figs and dried figs and pressed figs are one, and one may set aside <i>Terumah</i> from one for the other. Any place where there is a <i>Kohen</i> [member of priestly caste], the <i>Terumah</i> should be set aside from the finer species. And any place where there is not a <i>Kohen</i>, the <i>Terumah</i> should be set aside from the longer lasting species. Rabbi Yehudah said, he should always set the <i>Terumah</i> aside from the finer species.
One should set aside as <i>Terumah</i> a whole small onion, rather than half of a large onion. Rabbi Yehudah said: not so, rather half of a large onion. And thus did Rabbi Yehudah say, one should set aside as <i>Terumah</i> onions from within the towns for [onions from within] the villages, but not [onions] from within the villages for [onions from within] the towns, because it is the food of the aristocracy.
One should set aside <i>Terumah</i> oil olives for pickled olives but not pickled olives for oil olives, and unboiled wine for boiled wine but not boiled wine for unboiled wine. The rule is that for any species that is considered <i>Kilayim</i> [forbidden mix of two species] with another species, one should not set aside <i>Terumah</i> from one [species] for the other [species], even from the good [species] for the bad [species]. And any species that is not considered <i>Kilayim</i> with another species, one may set aside <i>Terumah</i> from the good [species] for the bad [species], but not from the bad [species] for the good [species]. But if one set aside <i>Terumah</i> from the bad for the good, his <i>Terumah</i> is valid <i>Terumah</i>, except for from darnel [a poisonous rye grass] for wheat, since [darnel] is not a food. The gourd and the cucumber are one species. Rabbi Yehudah says [they are] two species.

Chapter 3

If one set aside a gourd as <i>Terumah</i> [produce consecrated for priestly consumption] and it was found to be bitter, a melon and it was found to be rotten, it is [considered valid] <i>Terumah</i> but he must again give <i>Terumah</i>. If one set aside a barrel of wine as <i>Terumah</i> and it was found to be vinegar, if it was known to be vinegar before he set it aside as <i>Terumah</i>, is is [not considered valid] <i>Terumah</i>. But if it had become vinegar after he had given it as <i>Terumah</i>, behold it is <i>Terumah</i>. In a case of doubt, it is <i>Terumah</i> but he must again give <i>Terumah</i>. The first [set of <i>Terumah</i>] will not render on its own [another substance that it falls into] <i>Demai</i> [produce from which it is uncertain if tithes are already taken] and does not require a fine of a fifth [of its value if eaten by an Israelite], and so too with the second [set of <i>Terumah</i>].
If one of them fell into <i>Chulin</i> [non-sacred produce], it does not render [the <i>Chulin</i>] <i>Demai</i>. If the second fell into a different place, it does not render [that place] <i>Demai</i>. If both fell into the same place, it renders it <i>Demai</i> according to [whether] the smaller one [is large enough to render the mixture <i>Demai</i>].
Partners who set aside <i>Terumah</i>, the one after the other: Rabbi Akiva says: the <i>Terumah</i> of both of them is [valid] <i>Terumah</i>. But the Sages say: [only] the <i>Terumah</i> of the first is <i>Terumah</i>. Rabbi Yosi says: if the first set aside <i>Terumah</i> according to the prescribed amount, the <i>Terumah</i> of the second is not <i>Terumah</i>, but if the first did not set aside <i>Terumah</i> according to the prescribed amount, the <i>Terumah</i> of the second is <i>Terumah</i>.
To what does this apply? Only if one did not confer [with the other], but if one permits a member of his household, or his male slave or female slave to set aside <i>Terumah</i> [for him], this <i>Terumah</i> is [considered valid] <i>Terumah</i>. If he annulled [this permission]: If he annulled it before he set aside <i>Terumah</i>, the Terumah is not [valid] <i>Terumah</i>. But if he annulled it after he set aside <i>Terumah</i>, the <i>Terumah</i> is <i>Terumah</i>. Workers have no permission to give <i>Terumah</i>, except for those who tread [grapes] for they immediately make the winepress impure.
If one says: “The <i>Terumah</i> of this pile is within it,” or, “its tithes are within it,” or, “the <i>Terumat Ma'aser</i> [a portion of the tithes that are given to the priest] is within it,” Rabbi Shimon says: he has [thereby] designated it [as <i>Terumah</i>, tithes, or <i>Terumat Ma'aser</i>]. But the Sages say: not unless he said, “It is in the north or south of it.” Rabbi Elazar Chisma says: if one says, “The <i>Terumah</i> of this pile is taken from it for it,” he has [thereby] designated it. Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov says: if one says, “The tenth part of this tithe is made into <i>Terumat Ma'aser</i> for it,” he has [thereby] designated it.
If one sets aside <i>Terumah</i> before <i>Bikurim</i> [first-fruits that must be given to the priest], or <i>Ma'aser Rishon</i> [first tithe, which must be given to the Levite] before <i>Terumah</i>, or <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> [second tithe, which must be eaten in Jerusalem] before <i>Ma'aser Rishon</i>, although he transgresses a negative commandment, that which he has done is done, for it is said: “You shall not delay your grain harvests and your grape harvests” (Exodus 22:28).
From where [do we derive] that [the setting aside of] <i>Bikurim</i> must precede <i>Terumah</i>, seeing that this one is called “<i>Terumah</i>” and “the first” and the other is [also] called “<i>Terumah</i>” and “the first”? Rather <i>Bikurim</i> take precedence since they are the first-fruits of all produce. And <i>Terumah</i> precedes <i>Ma'aser Rishon</i> because it is called “first.” And <i>Ma'aser Rishon</i> precedes <i>Ma'aser Sheni</i> because it includes that which is called “first” [<i>Terumat Ma'aser</i>].
He who intends to say ‘<i>Terumah</i>’ and says ‘tithe’, [or] ‘tithe’ and says ‘<i>Terumah</i>’ [or who intends to say] ‘<i>Olah</i>’ [burnt-offering] and he says ‘<i>Shelamim</i>’ [burnt offering, or] ‘<i>Shelamim</i>’ and he says ‘<i>Olah</i>’ [or who intends to vow that] ‘I will not enter this house,’ and says, ‘that house,’ [or] ‘That I will not give any benefit to this [man],’ and says ‘to that [man],’ he has said nothing until his mouth and mind are equivalent.
A non-Jew and a Cuthite, their <i>Terumah</i> is [considered valid] <i>Terumah</i> and their tithes are [valid] tithes and their <i>Hekdesh</i> [consecrated donations] is [valid] <i>Hekdesh</i>. Rabbi Yehudah says: the non-Jew does not have <i>Kerem Revai</i> [fruits in the four year after their planting, which are considered sacred]. But the Sages say: he does have it. The <i>Terumah</i> of a non-Jew makes [produce into which it falls into] <i>Demai</i> and [one who eats it unintentionally] is obligated [to pay back an extra] fifth. But Rabbi Shimon exempts him.

Chapter 4



Chapter 5



Chapter 6

One who eats terumah unwittingly must repay its value plus a fifth, whether he eats it or drinks it, or anoints himself with it, or whether the terumah is clean or unclean. [If he eats the added fifth] he must pay its fifth, and a fifth of that fifth. He may not repay with terumah, but rather with tithed hullin, which becomes terumah. And whatever may be repaid in its place also becomes terumah and if the priest wishes to forego [the fine], he cannot do so.
A daughter of an Israelite ate terumah and afterwards married a priest:If the terumah she ate had not yet been acquired by another priest she can repay to herself the value and the fifth. But if a priest had already acquired the terumah she had eaten, she must repay the value to the owners, but [she can repay] the fifth to herself, because they said that he who eats terumah unwittingly, pays the value to the owners and the fifth to whoever he wants.
If one gives his workmen or his guests terumah to eat he must repay the principal and they must pay the fifth, the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: they must pay both the value and the fifth, and he must pay them for the price of their meal....
If one stole terumah but did not eat it, he must return double-payment at the price of terumah. If he ate it, he must pay twice the value plus a fifth, one principal value and a fifth at the price of hullin, and the other principal at the price of terumah. If one stole terumah of dedicated property and ate it, he must repay two fifths and the principal value, for the laws of double-payment do not apply to dedicated property. They may not make repayment from gleanings, from forgotten sheaf, from peah or ownerless property. Nor from first tithe from which terumah has been taken, nor from second tithe or dedicated produce which have been redeemed, because one dedicated thing (kadosh) cannot be used to redeem another dedicated thing (kadosh), the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages permit [payment] with these.
They may not make repayment from gleanings, from forgotten sheaf, from peah or ownerless property. Nor from first tithe from which terumah has been taken, nor from second tithe or dedicated produce which have been redeemed, because one dedicated thing (kadosh) cannot be used to redeem another dedicated thing (kadosh), the words of Rabbi Meir. But the sages permit [payment] with these.
Rabbi Eliezer says: they may make repayment from one kind for another, provided that it is from a superior kind for an inferior kind. Rabbi Akiva says: they may make repayment only from the same kind. Hence if a man ate cucumbers grown a year before the seventh year, he must wait for those grown after the termination of the seventh year and repay with them. The same source which causes Rabbi Eliezer to be lenient causes Rabbi Akiva to be stringent, for it says: “And he shall give the priest the holy thing (hakadesh)” (Leviticus 22:14), [implying,] whatever is liable to become “kodesh,” the words of Rabbi Eliezer.  But Rabbi Akiva says: “And he shall give the priest the holy thing (kodesh),” [implying] the same kind of holy thing which he ate.

Chapter 7

A non-priest who eats teruma intentionally must repay the principal but need not repay an additional fifth. One who pays with non-sacred produce-if the priest wishes to forgive, he may forgive.
A daughter of priest who married a [non-priest] Israelite and subsequently ate teruma, must repay the principal [cost of the teruma] but does not have to pay an additional fifth. Her death [if she commits adultery (Bartenura)] is by burning. If she married one ineligible to marry a daughter of a priest, she must repay the principle and the additional fifth, and her death [for adultery] is by strangulation. These are the words of Rabbi Meir. The Sages say that in both cases, she must repay the principal but does not need to repay the additional fifth, and her death is by burning.
A non-priest who feeds teruma to his young children, or to his slaves, whether they are adults or children, as well as one who eats teruma outside of the Land of Israel, and one who eats less than an olive-bulk of teruma, must repay the principal, but need not pay the additional fifth. And since the payment is non-sacred, if the priest wishes to remit the payment, he may remit it.
This is the general principle: whenever one has to repay both the value and the fifth, the repayment becomes terumah, and if the priest desires to forgive the repayment, he cannot forgive. But whenever one has to repay the value only and not the fifth, the repayment remains hullin (non-sacred produce), and if the priest wishes to forgive the repayment, he can.
If there were two baskets, one of terumah and one of hullin, and a seah of terumah fell into one of them, but it is not known into which, behold I can assume that it had fallen into that of the terumah. [Two baskets] and it is not known which was of terumah and which of hullin, and he eats from one of them, he is exempt, and the second basket is treated as terumah and subject to the laws of hallah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Yose exempts it. If another person eats from the second basket he is exempt. If one man ate of both, he must repay the value of the smaller of the two....
If one of these [baskets] fell into hullin, it does not render it medumma (doubtful terumah), but the second is treated as terumah and subject to the law of hallah, the words of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yose exempts it. If the second falls elsewhere [into hullin] it does not render it medumma. If both of them fall into one place, they render it medumma according to [the proportion] of the smaller of the two.
If he used one of these [baskets] as seed, he is exempt, and the second is treated as if it were terumah and subject to the law of hallah, the words of Rabbi Meir. But Rabbi Yose exempts it. If another person uses the second as seed, then he is exempt. If one man uses both as seed, if it is of a kind whose seed disintegrates [in the ground] it is permissible, but if it is of the kind whose seed does not disintegrate it is prohibited.

Chapter 8

If a woman was eating terumah and someon walks in and tells her "your husband has died," or "he has divorced you," and also if a slave was eating terumah and someone walks in and tells him "your master has died," or "you were sold to a yisrael (non-priest, whose slaves may not eat terumah)," or "you were given as a gift," or "you were freed," and similarly, if a kohen was eating terumah and it becomes known that he is the son of a divorcee or of a halutzah (and therefore not eligible to eat terumah as a kohen), R. Eliezer obligates him to pay the principle and the fifth. R. Yehoshua exempts him [from payment]. If he was standing and offering a korban on the altar of the temple, and it becomes known that he is the son of a divorcee or a halutzah, R. Eliezer says, "all the korbanot that he offered on the altar are pasul (invalid)." R. Yehoshua deems them kasher (valid). If, [alternatively], it became known that he possesses a physical defect, his offering is invalid.
And in the cases just mentioned [in 8:1], if there was terumah in his mouth, R. Eliezer says, "they may swallow [the terumah]." R. Yehoshua says, "they must spit [the food] out." If, [in a slightly different case, someone is consuming terumah and] someone tells him, "you have just become tamei (ritually impure)," or "the terumah has just made you tamei," R. Eliezer says he may swallow [the terumah]. R. Yehoshua says he must spit it out. If [in another case, someone is eating terumah and finds out that] he was already tamei [prior to beginning consumption of the terumah] or that the terumah was already tamei [prior to his consumption of it], or that it was tevel (untithed produce), or that it was ma'aser rishon from which no terumat ma'aser was taken, or that it was ma'aser sheini or sanctified produce that was not redeemed, or if he tasted the taste of an insect in his mouth, (in any of these cases), he must spit out [the terumah].
If someone was eating a cluster of grapes and entered from the garden into the courtyard, R. Eliezer says, "he may finish" [the cluster of grapes]. R. Yehoshua says, "he may not finish" [the cluster of grapes].  If Shabbat evening begins [precisely as he is consuming the cluster of grapes], R. Eliezer says "he may finish." R. Yehoshua says, "he may not finish."
If some left terumah wine uncovered, he must pour it out [because it may no longer terumah due to contamination]. It is not necessary to say this for hullin (non-sanctified) wine. Three kinds of liquids are forbidden from consumption if left uncovered: water, wine, and milk. All other drinks [if left uncovered] are [nonetheless] permitted [for consumption]. How long [must they be left uncovered for them] to be forbidden [from consumption]? [The time that it takes] in order for a snake to come out [from where it lives] and drink [from the wine].
The amount of water that may be left uncovered [without being rendered forbidden] is [greater than or equal to] the amount that can neutralize the poison. R. Yose says, in vessels, all [quantities of water] are forbidden [from being consumed, if the vessel is left uncovered]. [R. Yose continues, saying], for water contained [not in vessels but] in the ground, forty se'ahs [is the minimum quantity of water that can be left uncovered and still be permitted for drinking].
Figs, grapes, cucumbers, pumpkins, melons or watermelons that have bite marks, even if they are in a jar, both large or small, both plucked or still attached to the soil, they are forbidden as long as there is juice in them. [An animal] bitten by a snake is forbidden on account of the danger to life.
A wine-filter [used as a cover] does not prevent [the wine from becoming] forbidden by being uncovered. But Rabbi Nehemiah permits it.
A jar of terumah which may have become impure: Rabbi Eliezer says: if it had been deposited in an exposed place, he must now place it in a hidden place; and if it had formerly been uncovered, it must now be covered. But Rabbi Joshua says: if it had been in a hidden place, he must now place it in an exposed place; and if it had formerly been covered up, he must now uncover it. Rabban Gamaliel says: let him not do anything new to it.
A jar [of terumah] was broken in the upper part of the wine-press, and the lower part was unclean: Both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that if one can save at least a reviit of it in cleanness he should save it. But if not: Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and become unclean of its own accord, and let him not make it unclean with his own hands.
Similarly a jar of [terumah] oil which spilled: Both Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Joshua agree that if he can save at least a reviit in purity he should save it; But if not: Rabbi Eliezer says: let it flow down and be swallowed up by the ground, and let him not make it unclean with his own hands.
Concerning both cases Rabbi Joshua said: This is not the kind of terumah over which I am cautioned lest I defile it, but rather to eat of it and not to defile it. If one was passing from place to place with loaves of terumah in his hand and a Gentile said to him: “Give me one of these and I will make it unclean; for if not, I will defile them all,” let him defile them all, and not give him deliberately one to defile, the words of Rabbi Eliezer. But Rabbi Joshua says: he should place one of them on a rock.
Similarly, if gentiles say to women, “Give us one of you that we may defile her, and if not, we will defile you all”, then let them all be defiled rather than hand over to them one soul from Israel.

Chapter 9

He who plants terumah, if unwittingly, may overturn it, but if intentionally, he must allow it to remain. If it had already grown a third of its full size, whether he had planted it unwittingly or intentionally, he must allow it to remain. But in the case of flax, even when planted intentionally he must overturn it.
And it is subject to gleanings, the forgotten sheaf and peah. Poor Israelites and poor priests may glean them, but the poor Israelites must sell theirs to priests for the price of terumah and the money becomes theirs. Rabbi Tarfon says: only poor priests may glean them, lest [the others] forget and put it into their mouths. Rabbi Akiva said to him: if that be so, then only those who are clean should be allowed to glean.
And it is also subject to tithes and poor man’s tithe.Both Israelites and priests that are poor may accept them, but the poor Israelites must sell that which is theirs to the priest for the price of terumah and the money belongs to them. He who beats the grain with sticks [instead of threashing with an animal] is to be praised. But he who threshes it [by having an animal walk on it] what should he do? He must suspend baskets from the neck of the animal and place in them from the same kind, with the result that he will neither muzzle the animal nor feed it terumah.
What grows from terumah is terumah, but that which grows from growths [of terumah] is hullin. As for untithed produce, first tithe, after-growths from the sabbatical year, terumah grown outside the land, mixtures of hullin with terumah (medumma) and first-fruits—what grows from them is hullin. What grows from dedicated produce and second tithe is hullin and it is to be redeemed [at its value] at the time when it was sown.
If a hundred rows were planted with terumah seeds and one with hullin, they all are permitted, if they are of a kind whose seed disintegrates in the soil. But if they are of a kind whose seed does not disintegrate in the soil, then even if there be a hundred [rows] of hullin and one of terumah, they all are prohibited.
As for untithed produce, what grows from it is permissible if of a kind whose seed disintegrates [in the soil]. But if of a kind whose seed does not disintegrate, then even what grows from plants which grew out of it are forbidden. Which is the kind whose seed does not disintegrate? Like luf, garlic and onions. Rabbi Judah says: onions are like barley.
He who weeds allium plants (whose seeds do not disintegrate) for a Gentile, even though the produce is untithed he eat from them in a casual fashion. Saplings of terumah which had become unclean and were re-planted, become clean from their uncleanness. But they must not be eaten until the edible part [of the stalk] has been lopped off. Rabbi Judah says: he must [before eating] lop off a second time that which grew on the edible part.

Chapter 10

An onion [of terumah] was placed into lentils: If the onion was whole, it is permissible; But if [the onion] had been cut up, [it is forbidden if it] imparts a flavor. In the case of other dishes, whether the onion is whole or cut up [it is forbidden] if it imparts a flavor. Rabbi Judah permits it in the case of mashed fish, because it is used only to remove the unpleasant flavor.
If an apple [of terumah] was chopped and placed into dough [of hullin] so that it leavened it, [the dough] is forbidden. If barley [of terumah] fell into a cistern of water, though [the barley] stinks up the water, the water is permissible.
One who removes warm bread from an oven and places it over an open barrel of terumah wine: Rabbi Meir says: it is forbidden. Rabbi Judah permits it. Rabbi Yose permits the bread of wheat but not of barley, because barley absorbs.
If an oven was heated with cumin of terumah and bread was baked in it, the bread is permitted, because it is the smell but not the flavor of the cumin.
Fenugreek which fell into a vat of wine. If it was terumah or second tithe and there is in the seed alone without the stalk sufficient to impart a flavor [it is forbidden]. But if it was seventh year produce or mixed seeds in vineyards, or dedicated produce, [it is forbidden] if in both seed and stalk there is sufficient to impart a flavor.
If one had bunches of fenugreek of mixed seeds of the vineyard, they must be burned. If he had bunches of fenugreek of untithed produce, he must beat them and calculate the amount of seed within them and set aside [terumah] from the seed, but he need not separate terumah from the stalks. But if he did set aside [the terumah from the stalks before he beat the bunches] he must not say: “I will beat out [the seed] and take the stalks and give only the seed” but he must give the stalks together with the seed.
Olives of hullin which were pickled together with olives of terumah, whether it was a case where crushed [olives] of hullin [which were pickled together] with crushed [olives] of terumah, or crushed [olives] of hullin with whole [olives] of terumah, or with juice of terumah, they are forbidden. But if whole [olives] of hullin were pickled with crushed [olives] of terumah, they are permitted.
Unclean fish which was pickled with clean fish: If the jug contains two seahs and the unclean fish weighs ten zuz in Judean measure, which is five selas in Galilean measure, the brine is forbidden. Rabbi Judah says: it needs be a quarter [of a log] in two seahs. Rabbi Yose says: one-sixteenth of it.
If unclean locusts were pickled together with clean ones, they do not make the brine forbidden. Rabbi Zadok testified that the brine of unclean locusts is clean.
[Vegetables] pickled together are permitted, except [when pickled] with allium (onions, garlic, leeks). Allim of hullin [pickled] with allium of terumah, or other vegetables of hullin with leeks of terumah are forbidden. But allium of hullin with vegetables of terumah are permitted....
Rabbi Yose says: Anything stewed with [terumah] beets becomes forbidden, because they impart a flavor. Rabbi Shimon says: cabbage from a field artificially irrigated [that is stewed] with [terumah] cabbage from a field watered by rain, is forbidden because it absorbs. Rabbi Akiba says: all things cooked together are permitted, except those with meat. Rabbi Yohanan ben Nuri says: liver renders other things forbidden, but does not become forbidden, because it gives off [flavor] but does not absorb.
If an egg is boiled with forbidden spices even its yolk is forbidden, because it absorbs. The water in which terumah has been stewed or pickled is forbidden to non-priests.

Chapter 11

One must not put a cake of pressed [terumah] figs or dried [terumah] figs into fish-brine, since it spoils them. But one may place [terumah] wine into fish brine. One must not perfume the oil,But one may put honey and pepper into wine. One may not boil terumah wine, because it decreases it. Rabbi Judah permits this, because it improves it.
[A non-priest drank] honey of dates, wine of apples, vinegar from winter grapes, and all other kinds of fruit juice of terumah: Rabbi Eliezer makes him liable to repay their value and the fifth; But Rabbi Joshua exempts from the fifth. Rabbi Eliezer declares [these] susceptible to uncleanness as liquids. Rabbi Joshua says: the sages have not enumerated seven liquids as those that count spices, but rather they stated: seven liquids make things susceptible to uncleanliness, whereas all other liquids do not make susceptible.
One must not make dates into honey, apples into wine, winter-grapes into vinegar, or change any other kind of fruit that is terumah or second tithe from their natural state, except olives and grapes. One does not receive forty lashes on account of orlah except with that which comes from olives and grapes. Liquids cannot be brought as first fruits, except with that which comes from olives and grapes. And no fruit juice is susceptible to uncleanness as liquids except with that which comes from olives and grapes. And nothing [that is derived from fruit] can be offered on the altar except with that which comes from olives and grapes.
The stems of fresh figs and dried figs, klisim and carobs of terumah are forbidden to non-priests....
Seeds of terumah [fruit]:When he gathers them in, they are prohibited. But if he throws them away, they are permitted. Similarly, the bones of holy things: When he gathers them in, they are prohibited. But if he throws them away, they are permitted. Coarse bran is permitted. Fine bran of new wheat is forbidden, and old wheat permitted. One may act with regard to terumah as one does with hullin. One who sifts a kav or two [of fine flour] from a seah of wheat, must not leave the rest to ruin, but rather he should put it in a hidden place.
If a store-chamber was cleared of terumah wheat, they do not need to force him to sit down and collect each grain, but rather he may sweep it all up in his usual manner and then deposit hullin in it.
Similarly, if a jar of oil is upset, they do not need to force him to sit down and scoop it up [with his fingers], but he may deal with it as he would in a case of hullin.
One who pours from jar to jar and three drops drip, he may place in it hullin. But if he inclined the jar [on its side] in order to drain it, it is terumah. How much terumat maaser of demai must there be for him to take it to the priest? One eighth of an eighth [of a log].
Vetches of terumah may be given to cattle, to wild beasts or fowls. If an Israelite hired a cow from a priest, he may give it vetches of terumah to eat. But if a priest hired a cow from an Israelite, even though the responsibility of feeding it is his, he must not feed it with vetches of terumah. If an Israelite undertakes the care of a cow from a priest, he must not feed it with vetches of terumah. But if a priest undertakes the care of a cow from an Israelite, he may feed it on vetches of terumah.
One may burn terumah oil that has to be burnt in synagogues, houses of study, dark alleys, and for sick people with permission of the priest. If the daughter of an Israelite married to a priest regularly goes to her father’s house, her father may burn [such oil] with her permission. One may also burn [such oil] in a house of celebration but not in a house of mourning, the words of Rabbi Judah. Rabbi Yose says: in the house of mourning, but not in a house of celebration. Rabbi Meir forbids it in both places.But Rabbi Shimon permits it in both places.
